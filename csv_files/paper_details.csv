"Light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which will be increasingly used in lighting technology, will also allow for distribution of broadband optical wireless signals. Visible-light communication (VLC) using white LEDs offers several advantages over the RF-based wireless systems, i.e., license-free spectrum, low power consumption, and higher privacy. Mostly, optical wireless can provide much higher data rates. In this paper, we demonstrate a VLC system based on a white LED for indoor broadband wireless access. After investigating the nonlinear effects of the LED and the power amplifier, a data rate of 1 Gb/s has been achieved at the standard illuminance level, by using an optimized discrete multitone modulation technique and adaptive bit- and power-loading algorithms. The bit-error ratio of the received data was 1.5\cdot 10^{-3} , which is within the limit of common forward error correction (FEC) coding. These results twice the highest capacity that had been previously obtained.",[],[]
"We present a slot-waveguide-based ring resonator in silicon on insulator (SOI) with a footprint of only13 μm×10 μm, fabricated with optical lithography. Experiments show that it has 298 nm/RIU sensitivity and a detection limit of4.2⋅10−5 RIUfor changes in the refractive index of the top cladding. We prove for the first time that surface chemistry for selective label-free sensing of proteins can be applied inside a 100 nm-wide slot region and demonstrate that the application of a slot waveguide instead of a normal waveguide increases the sensitivity of an SOI ring resonator with a factor 3.5 for the detection of proteins.","['Biosensors', 'Optical ring resonators', 'Silicon on insulator technology', 'Proteins', 'Optical waveguides', 'Biomedical optical imaging', 'Optical refraction', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical variables control', 'Lithography']","['Biosensor', 'ring resonator', 'silicon on insulator', 'slot waveguide']"
"Metamaterials are artificial composites that acquire their electromagnetic properties from embedded subwavelength metallic structures. In theory, the effective electromagnetic properties of metamaterials at any frequency can be engineered to take on arbitrary values, including those not appearing in nature. As a result, this new class of materials can dramatically add a degree of freedom to the control of electromagnetic waves. The emergence of metamaterials fortunately coincides with the intense emerging interest in terahertz radiation (T-rays), for which efficient forms of electromagnetic manipulation are sought. Considering the scarcity of naturally existing materials that can control terahertz, metamaterials become ideal substitutes that promise advances in terahertz research. Ultimately, terahertz metamaterials will lead to scientific and technological advantages in a number of areas. This article covers the principles of metamaterials and reviews the latest trends in terahertz metamaterial research from the fabrication and characterization to the implementation.","['Metamaterials', 'Magnetic materials', 'Frequency', 'Optical resonators', 'Permittivity', 'Permeability', 'Dielectric materials', 'Optical materials', 'Electromagnetic radiation', 'Photonics']","['Metamaterials', 'THz optics']"
"Many novel materials and device designs have been proposed as photonic analogs to electrical diodes over the last four decades. This paper seeks to revisit these materials and designs as advanced technologies may enable experimental realization that was not possible upon conception of several of these designs. The background behind integration challenges, including waveguide birefringence, fabrication tolerances, garnet/semiconductor mismatch, and optimized interfaces will hopefully spark new ideas that will finally enable the realization of integrated optical isolators and circulators.","['Garnets', 'Isolators', 'Faraday effect', 'Magnetooptic devices', 'Optical waveguides']","['YIG', 'isolators', 'circulators', 'nonreciprocal optics', 'Faraday rotation', 'beatlength', 'quasi phase matching', 'birefringences', 'non-reciprocal phase shift', 'NRPS', 'wafer-bonding', 'Bi:YIG', 'Ce:YIG', 'push/pull']"
"In this paper, we present a comprehensive channel modeling and characterization study for visible light communications. Our study is based on ray tracing, which allows for an accurate description of the interaction of rays emitted from the lighting source within a specified confined space. Contrary to existing works, which are mainly limited to ideal Lambertian sources and purely diffuse reflections, our approach is capable of obtaining channel impulse responses (CIRs) for any nonideal sources, as well as specular and mixed specular-diffuse reflections. Furthermore, we can precisely reflect the presence of objects (e.g., furniture) and wavelength-dependent reflection characteristics of surface materials (e.g., ceilings, floor, walls, and furniture) in a channel study. As case studies, we consider a number of indoor environments with various dimensions and different surface materials, i.e., plaster, gloss paint, wood, aluminum metal, and glass. We further consider various scenarios with different transmitter specifications (i.e., single versus multiple transmitters and array type) and receiver specifications (i.e., location and rotation). For each environment, we obtain CIRs and present a channel characterization study where channel parameters, such as channel DC gain, root mean square (RMS) delay spread, coherence bandwidth, and mean excess delay, are obtained. We also make one-to-one comparisons between infrared and visible-light CIRs for the same environments to emphasize the differences between two optical bands.","['Reflection', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Reflectivity', 'Solid modeling', 'Ray tracing', 'Visible light communication', 'Indoor environments']","['Visible light communications', 'channel modeling', 'ray tracing']"
"In order to realize fast and accurate estimation of intercore crosstalk in bent multicore fibers (MCFs), an analytical expression of the average power-coupling coefficient (PCC) based on an exponential autocorrelation function is, for the first time, derived, resulting in no need for heavy numerical computations. It is revealed that, when the bending radius is large and the correlation length is large, the average PCC is inversely proportional to the correlation length and to the square of the propagation constant difference Δβ mn between core m and core n, and when the bending radius is small and the correlation length is large, the average PCC is proportional to the bending radius and is independent of the correlation length. When the correlation length is small, on the other hand, the average PCC is proportional to the correlation length and is independent of the bending radius. For homogeneous MCFs (Δβ mn = 0) with small bending radius, the average PCC coincides with the mean crosstalk increase per unit length derived from the coupled-mode theory of Hayashi et al. that is proportional to the bending radius. Average crosstalk values calculated by using the analytical expression derived here are in excellent agreement with those of numerical solutions of coupled-power equations, irrespective of the values of bending radius and correlation length.","['Correlation', 'Crosstalk', 'Optical fiber networks', 'Optical fiber theory', 'Propagation constant', 'Mathematical model', 'Integral equations']","['Multicore fiber (MCF)', 'intercore crosstalk', 'coupled-power theory (CPT)', 'power-coupling coefficient (PCC)', 'analytical expression']"
"PECVD silicon nitride photonic wire waveguides have been fabricated in a CMOS pilot line. Both clad and unclad single mode wire waveguides were measured at λ = 532, 780, and 900 nm, respectively.

"This paper introduces an optical vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system based on an optical wireless communication technology using an LED transmitter and a camera receiver, which employs a special CMOS image sensor, i.e, an optical communication image sensor (OCI). The OCI has a “communication pixel (CPx)” that can promptly respond to light intensity variations and an output circuit of a “flag image” in which only high-intensity light sources, such as LEDs, have emerged. The OCI that employs these two technologies provides capabilities for a 10-Mb/s optical signal reception and real-time LED detection to the camera receiver. The optical V2V communication system consisting of the LED transmitters mounted on a leading vehicle and the camera receiver mounted on a following vehicle is constructed, and various experiments are conducted under real driving and outdoor lighting conditions. Due to the LED detection method using the flag image, the camera receiver correctly detects LEDs, in real time, in challenging outdoor conditions. Furthermore, between two vehicles, various vehicle internal data (such as speed) and image data (320 × 240, color) are transmitted successfully, and the 13.0-fps image data reception is achieved while driving outside.","['Optical transmitters', 'Optical imaging', 'Optical receivers', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Cameras', 'Optical sensors']","['Optical wireless communication (OWC)', 'visible light communication (VLC)', 'LED transmitter', 'camera receiver', 'CMOS image sensor', 'vehicle-to-vehicle communication']"
"We present relationships for the free-carrier-induced electrorefraction and electroabsorption in crystalline silicon over the 1-14-μm wavelength range. Electroabsorption modulation is calculated from impurity-doping spectra taken from the literature, and a Kramers-Kronig analysis of these spectra is used to predict electrorefraction modulation. More recent experimental results for terahertz absorption of silicon are also used to improve the commonly used 1.3- and 1.55-μm equations. We examine the wavelength dependence of electrorefraction and electroabsorption, finding that the predictions suggest longer wave modulator designs will, in many cases, be different from those used in the telecom range.","['Absorption', 'Silicon', 'Refractive index', 'Doping', 'Modulation', 'Mathematical model', 'Photonics']","['Absorption', 'electrooptic modulators', 'semiconductor impurities', 'silicon']"
"In this paper, we carry out a unified performance analysis of a dual-hop relay system over the asymmetric links composed of both radio-frequency (RF) and unified free-space optical (FSO) links under the effect of pointing errors. Both fixed and variable gain relay systems are studied. The RF link is modeled by the Nakagami-m fading channel and the FSO link by the Gamma-Gamma fading channel subject to both types of detection techniques (i.e., heterodyne detection and intensity modulation with direct detection). In particular, we derive new unified closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function, the probability density function, the moment generating function (MGF), and the moments of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of these systems in terms of the Meijer's G function. Based on these formulas, we offer exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP), the higher order amount of fading, and the average bit error rate (BER) of a variety of binary modulations in terms of the Meijer's G function. Furthermore, an exact closed-form expression of the end-to-end ergodic capacity is derived in terms of the bivariate G function. Additionally, by using the asymptotic expansion of the Meijer's G function at the high-SNR regime, we derive new asymptotic results for the OP, the MGF, and the average BER in terms of simple elementary functions.","['Relays', 'Radio frequency', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Rayleigh channels', 'Probability density function', 'Bit error rate']","['Free-space optics (FSO)', 'mixed RF/FSO systems', 'Nakagami-m fading', 'atmospheric turbulence', 'pointing errors', 'outage probability (OP)', 'bit-error rate (BER)', 'ergodic capacity', 'Meijer’s G function']"
"An optical wireless communication (OWC) system based on a light-emitting-diode (LED) transmitter and a camera receiver has been developed for use in the automotive area. The automotive OWC system will require Mb/s-class data rates and the ability to quickly detect LEDs from an image. The key to achieving this is improvements to the capabilities of the image sensor mounted on the camera receiver. In this paper, we report on a novel OWC system equipped with an optical communication image sensor (OCI), which is newly developed using CMOS technology. To obtain higher transmission rates, the OCI employs a specialized “communication pixel (CPx)” capable of responding promptly to optical intensity variations. Furthermore, a new quick LED detection technique, based on a 1-bit flag image which only reacts to high-intensity objects, is formulated. The communication pixels, ordinary image pixels, and associated circuits (including 1-bit flag image output circuits) are then integrated into the OCI. This paper describes the design, fabrication, and capabilities of the OCI, as well as the development of the LED and image sensor based OWC system, which boasts a 20-Mb/s/pixel data rate without LED detection and a 15-Mb/s/pixel data rate with a 16.6-ms real-time LED detection.","['Optical transmitters', 'Optical imaging', 'Optical sensors', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Vehicles', 'Optical receivers', 'Cameras']","['Optical wireless communication (OWC)', 'visible light communication (VLC)', 'light-emitting diode (LED)', 'complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor', 'image sensor based OWC', 'automotive communication system']"
"The fabrication studies of silica/polystyrene (PS) colloidal microlens arrays with various aspect ratios were performed on the III-nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The use of colloidal-based microlens arrays led to significant enhancement in light extraction efficiency for III-nitride LEDs. In varying the aspect ratios of the microlens arrays, the engineering of various PS thicknesses was employed by using high-temperature treatment and redeposition process. The effects of PS thickness on the light extraction efficiency and far-field emission patterns of InGaN quantum-well (QW) LEDs were studied. The total output powers of microlens LEDs with various PS thicknesses exhibited 1.93–2.70 times enhancement over that of planar LEDs, and the use of optimized PS layer thickness is important in leading the enhancement of the light extraction efficiency in large angular direction.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Lenses', 'Microoptics', 'Annealing', 'Suspensions', 'Fabrication', 'Scanning electron microscopy']","['III-Nitrides', 'light-emitting diodes (LEDs)', 'light extraction efficiency', 'microlens arrays', 'far-field radiation']"
"We demonstrate a switchable dual-wavelength synchronously pulsed fiber laser Q-switched by graphene saturable absorber. Wavelength-resolved studies on the output Q-switched pulses show that despite of large wavelength spacing up to 26 nm, the two Q-switched pulses at each individual wavelength can be temporally synchronized with per-pulse energy up to ~ 70 nJ. Further experiments show that by adjusting the intracavity birefringence, dual-wavelength emission can be switched to another dual-wavelength operation regime with wavelength separation of 5.7 nm.

"We simulate and analyze the mode properties and propagation effects of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes in a ring fiber. A ring fiber with 0.05 up-doping is designed in simulation to support up to 10 OAM modes while maintaining single-mode condition radially. With a multiple-ring fiber, tens of OAM modes can be potentially multiplexed to greatly enhance the system capacity and spectral efficiency. The mode index difference can be maintained above 10 -4 over hundreds of nanometers optical bandwidth. Higher order OAM modes' azimuthal intensity and odd-order OAM modes' azimuthal phase show better tolerance to the fiber ellipticity. Moreover, higher order OAM modes also have longer 2π and 10-ps walk-off length. After 600-km propagation, OAM 0,4 mode shows <; 10-ps mode walk- off, even in a ring fiber with 1% ellipticity. Also, in such an elliptical fiber, the well-aligned OAM modes with different charges have <;-20 dB intermode crosstalk. The improvement of the circularity for the ring fiber is expected to reduce the crosstalk and increase the demultiplexing efficiency.","['Multiplexing', 'Indexes', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Optical fiber networks']","['Fiber optics systems', 'multiplexing', 'optics', 'orbital angular momentum', 'waveguides']"
"In this paper, we report a direct comparison between coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) and photonic crystal waveguides (PhCWs), which have both been exploited as tunable delay lines. The two structures were fabricated on the same silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technological platform, with the same fabrication facilities and evaluated under the same signal bit-rate conditions. We compare the frequency- and time-domain response of the two structures; the physical mechanism underlying the tuning of the delay; the main limits induced by loss, dispersion, and structural disorder; and the impact of CROW and PhCW tunable delay lines on the transmission of data stream intensity and phase modulated up to 100 Gb/s. The main result of this study is that, in the considered domain of applications, CROWs and PhCWs behave much more similarly than one would expect. At data rates around 100 Gb/s, CROWs and PhCWs can be placed in competition. Lower data rates, where longer absolute delays are required and propagation loss becomes a critical issue, are the preferred domain of CROWs fabricated with large ring resonators, while at data rates in the terabit range, PhCWs remain the leading technology.","['Delay lines', 'Photonic crystals', 'Optical waveguides', 'Optical resonators', 'Optical ring resonators', 'Silicon on insulator technology', 'Propagation losses', 'Optical coupling', 'Optical device fabrication', 'Frequency']","['Slow light', 'delay lines', 'coupled resonators', 'rings', 'silicon photonics', 'photonic crystals', 'differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK)']"
"The communication between two legitimate peers in the presence of an external eavesdropper is studied from a physical-layer security perspective in the context of free-space optical (FSO) communications. We discuss viable mechanisms to eavesdrop the communication and study the effect of random optical irradiance fluctuations inherent to FSO communications on the probability of achieving a secure transmission. We observe that the joint effect of laser-beam divergence and turbulence-induced fading on the received irradiance, under certain conditions, allows an external eavesdropper close to the legitimate receiver to compromise the communication. Interestingly, we also observe that an eavesdropper placed close to the legitimate transmitter can easily compromise the communication by taking advantage of the larger attenuation suffered by the signal when propagating through the FSO link.","['Optical transmitters', 'Laser beams', 'Security', 'Optical receivers', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Signal to noise ratio']","['Atmospheric Turbulence', 'Free-Space Optical Communications', 'Physical Layer Security', 'Secrecy']"
"Radio-on-free space optical (RoFSO) communication systems are rapidly gaining popularity as an efficient and cost-effective means of transferring high data rates and radio frequency (RF) signals with the same capacity as optical fiber. However, the performance of those systems depends strongly on the atmospheric conditions and the nonlinear characteristics of the optical link. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model for the transmission of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based signals over freespace optics (FSO) links. Further, we derive a closed-form bit error probability (BEP) and outage probability expressions, taking into account the optical noises, the laser diode nonlinear distortion, and the atmospheric turbulence effect on the FSO channel modeled by the gamma-gamma distribution. This paper reports the most significant parameters that degrade the transmission performance of the OFDM signal over FSO links and indicates the cases that provide the optimal operating conditions for the link. The obtained results can be useful for designing, predicting, and evaluating the RoFSO system's ability to transmit wireless services over turbulent FSO links under actual conditions.","['Atmospheric modeling', 'Adaptive optics', 'Fiber nonlinear optics', 'Optical distortion', 'Radio frequency', 'OFDM', 'RF signals', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Analytical models']","['Free-space optics (FSO)', 'orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)', 'Radio over Fiber (RoF)', 'radio on FSO', 'gamma–gamma distribution', 'atmospheric turbulence.']"
"A simple configuration for the generation of tunable multiwavelength picosecond-pulse fiber ring lasers by exploiting the intracavity birefringence-induced comb filter is demonstrated. The fiber laser is passively mode locked by using nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) technique. The polarization-dependent isolator combined with the intracavity birefringence acts as two functions: the tunable comb filter and the mode locker. Up to four-wavelength picosecond pulses were simultaneously obtained in the experiment. The mode competition of the multiwavelength lasing is suppressed by the use of NPR-induced intensity-dependent loss. In addition, the number of the lasing wavelengths, the lasing location, and the spacing between the lasing wavelengths could be flexibly tuned by properly rotating the polarization controllers.","['Tunable circuits and devices', 'Fiber lasers', 'Laser mode locking', 'Ring lasers', 'Birefringence', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Erbium-doped fiber lasers', 'Filters', 'Optical pulse generation', 'Optical pulses']","['Multiwavelength lasers', 'passively mode-locked', 'fiber lasers', 'birefringence filter']"
"Theoretical and experimental studies of mid-infrared (mid-IR) suspended membrane waveguide (SMW) and suspended membrane ring (SMR) resonator are presented.

"We present manufacturing tolerances of cascaded silicon microring resonators fabricated in a commercial 130-nm complementary-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundry using 193-nm lithography and provide statistics gathered from over 500 four-channel microring arrays over multiple wafers and fabrication lots. We quantify intrawafer and interwafer variation of the position and relative spacing of resonance wavelengths for the microring arrays and confirm prior predictions that the absolute resonance positions of such devices cannot be controlled across wafers or even across reticles within a wafer. However, we show that the free spectral range (FSR) of the microrings can be controlled to within 0.66 nm (83 GHz) across wafers and lots, as can the wavelength spacing between closely spaced microrings. To exploit these findings for low-power optical interconnects, we suggest and demonstrate a synthetic resonant comb with FSR ≈ N * δλ, wherein resonance wavelengths are spaced equally across the FSR in order to minimize postfabrication tuning. The experimental CMOS 1 × 8 microring array requires an average tuning of less than 1.2 nm/channel to align to a 200-GHz wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) grid.

"The transmission performance of a free-space optical (FSO) link could be severely degraded due to atmospheric turbulence, which causes the temporal and spatial fluctuation of light intensity. Both the space diversity reception technique (SDRT) and advanced modulation formats can successfully mitigate the transmission impairments of the atmospheric turbulence. The purpose of this paper is to study and compare the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of several widely used modulation formats under different atmospheric turbulence scenarios with and without SDRT. The modulation formats studied in this paper include on–off keying (OOK), differential phase-shift keying (DPSK), and differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK). We derive a series-form formula for evaluating the BER performance of the DPSK format in the Gamma–Gamma distributed channel with SDRT. We use both theoretical analysis and simulation to examine the BER performance of OOK, DPSK, and DQPSK formats with and without SDRT. It is found that, in the strongly turbulent scenario, the OOK and DPSK formats can have as large as 19.5 and 20.3 dB of SDRT gains at the BER of10−3, respectively. Using SDRT, the modulation gains of the DPSK format over the OOK format are 3.2 dB in the strongly turbulent scenario and 4.5 dB in the weakly turbulent scenario, respectively. In addition, in the moderately and strongly turbulent scenarios, it is found that the DPSK and DQPSK formats have almost the same BER performance under the same symbol rate.",[],[]
"In this paper, for the first time, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid post equalizer in a high-order CAP modulation based VLC system. Considering that the linear and nonlinear distortions have been considered as the major obstacles to high-speed VLC transmission, some equalization schemes should be employed, including DFE, RLS, DD-LMS, and Volterra nonlinear equalizer. To eliminate both the linear and nonlinear distortions, we propose the use of a hybrid post equalizer consisting of a linear equalizer, a Volterra nonlinear equalizer, and a DD-LMS equalizer in a high-speed VLC system.

"Fluctuations of the optical power incident on a photodiode can be converted into phase fluctuations of the resulting electronic signal due to nonlinear saturation in the semiconductor. This impacts overall timing stability (phase noise) of microwave signals generated from a photodetected optical pulse train. In this paper, we describe and utilize techniques to characterize this conversion of amplitude noise to phase noise for several high-speed (>; 10 GHz) InGaAs p-i-n photodiodes operated at 900 nm. We focus on the impact of this effect on the photonic generation of low phase noise 10-GHz microwave signals and show that a combination of low laser amplitude noise, appropriate photodiode design, and optimum average photocurrent is required to achieve phase noise at or below -100 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset for a 10-GHz carrier. In some photodiodes, we find specific photocurrents where the power-to-phase conversion factor is observed to go to zero.","['Photodiodes', 'Masers', 'Photoconductivity', 'Phase measurement', 'Noise', 'Measurement by laser beam']","['Frequency combs', 'microwave photonics', 'photodetectors']"

"Deep-tissue multiphoton microscopy (MPM) enables noninvasive optical imaging into the deep regions of the tissue in animal models in vivo. High-order MPM techniques, such as three- and four-photon fluorescence microscopy at the 1700-nm window, are emerging as promising imaging techniques for deeper penetration. Currently, signal depletion at large imaging depth sets the depth limit for these imaging techniques. As a result, how to further boost signal level is the key to achieving a larger imaging depth. Contrary to the previous thought that overfilling the back aperture of the objective yields the highest multiphoton fluorescence signal, in this paper, through numerical simulation, we show that, due to the effect of exponential decay of the excitation beam, the signal generation is maximized for certain underfilling of the back aperture of the objective lens. This will provide a simple strategy for signal generation maximization in deep-tissue MPM and potentially enables deeper imaging penetration into the tissue.",[],[]
"The electrical and optical characteristics of InGaN quantum-well light-emitting diodes with large-bandgap AlGaInN thin barriers were analyzed with the consideration of carrier transport effect for efficiency droop suppression. The lattice-matched AlGaInN quaternary alloys with different compositions, thicknesses, and positions were employed as thin barrier layers (1-2 nm) surrounding the InGaN QW in LED structures. The increased effective barrier heights of AlGaInN thin barrier led to suppression of carrier leakage as compared to conventional InGaN QW LEDs with GaN barrier only.

Moreover, without the limitations of period-doubling bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation, by utilizing the period-one oscillation state with a single-beam injection scheme, the microwave signals generated with the proposed scheme have a much broader tuning range. In this paper, optical and power spectra of the microwave signals generated with the dual-beam optical injection scheme are compared with those generated with the optical mixing, the single-beam injection, and the unlocked dual-beam injection schemes. Generation of tunable microwave signals up to 120 GHz is demonstrated, which is currently limited by the locking range of the slave laser determined by the frequency difference between the Hopf (higher frequency) and the saddle node (lower frequency) bifurcation curves.","['Masers', 'Microwave oscillators', 'Microwave photonics', 'Optical mixing', 'Semiconductor lasers']","['Semiconductor lasers', 'instabilities and chaos', 'optical injection']"

"Light-emitting diode (LED)-based visible light communication (VLC), combining illumination and communication, is a promising technique for providing high-speed, low-cost indoor wireless services. In indoor environments, multiple LEDs routinely used as lighting sources may also be concomitantly invoked to support wireless services for multiple users, thus forming a multiuser multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Since the user terminals detect all the light rays impinging from multiple LEDs, inter-user interference may severely degrade the attainable system performance. Hence, we conceive a transceiver design for indoor VLC MU-MISO systems to suppress the multiuser interference (MUI). In contrast to classic radio-frequency (RF) communication, in VLC, the signals transmitted from the LEDs are restricted by optical constraints, such as the real-valued nonnegativity of the optical signal, the maximum permissible optical intensity, and the constant brightness requirements of the LEDs. Given these practical constraints, we design the optimal transceiver relying on the objective function of minimizing the maximum mean square error (MMSE) between the legitimate transmitted and received signals of the users and show that it can be readily found by solving a convex second-order cone program. Then, we also propose a simplified transceiver design by incorporating zero-forcing (ZF) transmit precoding (TPC) and show that the TPC coefficients can be efficiently found by solving a linear program.

"Chaotic dynamics of a semiconductor laser subject to distributed feedbacks from a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) are investigated through detailed simulations. Because of distributed reflections along the FBG, the approach of FBG feedback performs better than the conventional approach of mirror feedback in concealing the feedback delay time in chaos generation. The time-delay signature obtained from the autocorrelation function decreases as the FBG bandwidth decreases, which is attributed to the associated increase in the FBG dispersion. Such time-delay signature suppression is generally observed over a range of feedback parameters. The dynamical mappings of the laser subject to FBG feedback reveal large regions of chaotic states, except when the FBG bandwidth is much narrower than the relaxation resonance frequency of the laser.","['Laser feedback', 'Chaos', 'Fiber gratings', 'Semiconductor lasers', 'Fiber lasers', 'Distributed feedback devices']","['Semiconductor lasers', 'instabilities and chaos', 'fiber Bragg gratings']"

One laser carries 12.5 Gbaud optical baseband QPSK data, and the other acts as a carrier frequency generating laser. The two signals are heterodyne mixed at a photodetector in the RAU, and the baseband QPSK signal is transparently up-converted to the W-band.

"This paper investigates the average symbol error rate (ASER) performance of a dual-hop hybrid relaying system relying on both radio frequency (RF) and free-space optical (FSO) links. Specifically, an RF link is used for supporting mobile communication, whereas an FSO link is adopted as the backhaul of the cellular infrastructure. Considering nonline-of-sight RF transmissions and a generalized atmospheric turbulence (AT) channel, the associated statistical features constituted of both exact and asymptotic moment-generating functions are derived in the closed form. They are then used for calculating the ASER of M-ary phase-shift keying (PSK), differentially encoded noncoherent PSK (DPSK), and noncoherent frequency-shift keying. A range of additional asymptotic expressions is also derived for all the modulation schemes under high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). It is observed from the asymptotic analysis that the ASERs of all the modulation schemes are dominated by the average SNR of the RF link in the hybrid relaying system using a fixed relay gain, whereas in the relaying system using a dynamic channel-dependent relay gain, the ASERs of all the modulation schemes depend both on the average SNR and the AT condition of the FSO path. We also find that the fixed-gain relaying strategy achieves twice the diversity order of the channel-dependent relaying strategy, albeit at the cost of requiring a high power amplifier dynamic range at the relay node. Furthermore, by comparing the asymptotic ASERs, we calculate the SNR differences between the different modulation schemes in both the fixed-gain and channel-dependent relaying systems. Finally, simulation results are presented for confirming the accuracy of our expressions and observations.","['Radio frequency', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Scattering', 'Relays', 'Modulation', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Adaptive optics']","['Relay', 'atmospheric turbulence', 'free space optical communications', 'symbol error rate', 'hybrid RF/FSO']"

Strong Bragg gratings are easily inscribed using a 193-nm excimer laser and phase mask in microfiber drawn from the 62.5/125- μm standard multimode fiber (MMF) with no additional photosensitization treatment. The enlarged photosensitive core offered by the MMF provides a sufficient overlap between the fundamental mode and the induced refractive index modulation region, which significantly enhances the grating inscription efficiency. The grating inscription in the microfiber is even more efficient than that in the original MMF because the multibeam interference-induced fringe fuzziness in the normal size fiber does not occur as the fiber diameter down to the scale that is comparable with the Talbot length of the ultraviolet (UV)-writing light. The proposed method is beneficial for sensing and device applications of microfiber Bragg grating (mFBGs) because of the ease of fabrication, high coupling strength, and large wavelength separation between individual resonant dips.","['Bragg gratings', 'Fiber gratings', 'Couplings', 'Modulation', 'Silicon compounds']","['Fiber gratings', 'microoptics', 'sensors']"

"The transmission performance of multichannel adaptively modulated optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (AMOOFDM) signals is investigated numerically, for the first time, in optical-amplification-free and chromatic-dispersion-compensation-free intensity-modulation and direct-detection systems directly incorporating modulated distributed feedback (DFB) lasers (DMLs). It is shown that AMOOFDM not only significantly reduces the nonlinear wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) impairments induced by the effects of cross-phase modulation and four-wave mixing but also effectively compensates for the DML-induced frequency chirp effect. In comparison with conventional modulated optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which uses an identical signal modulation format across all the subcarriers, AMOOFDM improves the maximum achievable signal transmission capacity of a central WDM channel by a factor of 1.3 and 3.6 for 40- and 80-km standard single-mode fibers, respectively, with the corresponding dynamic input optical power ranges being extended by approximately 5 dB.

"Experimental demonstrations are reported for end-to-end real-time optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OOFDM) transceivers incorporating three widely adopted adaptive loading techniques, namely, power loading (PL), bit loading (BL), and bit-and-power loading (BPL). In directly modulated distributed-feedback (DFB) laser-based, intensity-modulation, and direct-detection (IMDD) transmission systems consisting of up to 35-km single-mode fibers (SMFs), extensive experimental comparisons between these adaptive loading techniques are made in terms of maximum achievable signal bit rate, optical power budget, and digital signal processing (DSP) resource usage. It is shown that BPL is capable of supporting end-to-end real-time OOFDM transmission of 11.75 Gb/s over 25-km SMFs in the aforementioned systems at sampling speeds as low as 4 GS/s. In addition, experimental measurements also show that BPL (PL) offers the highest (lowest) signal bit rate, and their optical power budgets are similar. The observed signal bit rate difference between BPL and PL is almost independent of sampling speed and transmission distance. All the aforementioned key features agree very well with numerical simulations. On the other hand, BPL-consumed DSP resources are approximately three times higher than those required by PL.

"We demonstrate a remotely up-converted and distributed 20-Gbit/s wireless on-off-keying (OOK) data transmission link at the W-band that uses a near-ballistic uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (NBUTC-PD)-based photonic transmitter-mixer. This device consists of an active NBUTC-PD integrated with a planar passive circuit for feeding the intermediate-frequency (IF) modulation input and extracting the up-converted optical-to-electrical (O-E) output signals. An equivalent-circuit model is developed, which allows for the O-E and IF responses to be independently optimized. Accordingly, we can achieve both an ultra-wide O-E bandwidth (67-118 GHz) and IF modulation bandwidth (>;15 GHz) with a very-low coupling loss (<; 2 dB) from the NBUTC-PD to the WR-10 waveguide. We adopted a remotely distributed 1-ps optical pulse train source with a repetition rate at 93 GHz to serve as a high-performance photonic carrier, which is generated by a spectral line-by-line shaper utilizing the repetition-rate multiplication (RRM) technique.

We show that the generated solitonic state is sustained when the modulation is turned off adiabatically.

"Transmittance of a straight junction between two plasmonic slot waveguides can be enhanced by either coupling a perpendicular stub to the input waveguide or inserting an intermediate slot section between the waveguides. We derive analytic expressions for the transmission spectra in these two configuration schemes and analyze them to obtain simple formulas, relating the parameters of the stub and intermediate slot section that maximize the transmittance at a given frequency. A considerable advantage of our results over the recently reported approximations is in their broader applicability domain, which is the consequence of the correct accounting for the phase shift resulting from the reflection of the surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) at the end of the stub, and inclusion of ohmic losses. By the example of a 100-fs Gaussian pulse at the telecommunication wavelength of 1.55 m, we demonstrate that both transmission enhancement techniques can almost completely eliminate SPP reflection from the junction of 125- and 25-nm-gap silver-air-silver plasmonic waveguides, whereupon the preference can be given to either of the techniques, depending on the desired design features. Although, for concreteness, we studied a pair of aligned slot waveguides, the concepts of optics and transmission-line theory that we marry in our work are not specific for straight junctions and are well suited for analyzing more complex waveguide geometries.

"We propose and experimentally demonstrate a compact notch microwave photonic filter (MPF) using two integrated microring resonators (MRRs) on a single silicon-on-insulator (SOI) chip. The free spectral ranges (FSRs) of two cascaded MRRs are 160 GHz and 165 GHz, respectively. Due to the vernier effect, the transmission spectrum of cascaded MRRs is a series of bimodal distribution whose interval is an arithmetic sequence. By locating the laser wavelength at the middle of different bimodal intervals and fine tuning it properly, both central frequency and bandwidth of the notch MPF can be tunable. In the experiment, the tunability of central frequency and 3-dB bandwidth are demonstrated from 2.5 GHz to 17.5 GHz and from 6 GHz to 9.5 GHz, respectively.

"Horizontal slot waveguides based on graphene have been considered an attractive structure for optical waveguide modulators for transverse magnetic (TM) modes. Graphene is embedded in the slot region of a horizontal slot waveguide. If graphene were treated as an isotropic material and its dielectric constant were made close to zero by adjusting its Fermi level, the surface-normal electric field component of the fundamental TM mode of a horizontal slot waveguide might be highly enhanced in graphene. This could cause a large increase in the attenuation coefficient of the mode. This is called the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) effect. This paper discusses that graphene needs to be treated as an anisotropic material that has an almost real surface-normal dielectric constant component. Then, the ENZ effect does not exist. Approximate analytic expressions and numerical simulation are used for the discussion, and they demonstrate that horizontal slot waveguides are not appropriate for graphene-based modulators for TM modes.","['Graphene', 'Optical waveguides', 'Mathematical model', 'Electric fields', 'Modulation', 'Dielectrics', 'Optical attenuators']","['Waveguide devices', 'optical properties of photonic materials', 'graphene']"

However, in the field of precision metrology, there is a demand for observing the photonic SHE directly, which will significantly reduce the complexity of experiment and improve the efficiency. Therefore, we need to find some methods for greatly enhancing the spin-dependent splitting in photonic SHE.

"Optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) with advanced modulation format [e.g., quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK)] provides many transmission advantages.

"The efficient generation of polarized single or entangled photons is a crucial requirement for the implementation of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Self-organized semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are capable of emitting one polarized photon or an entangled photon pair at a time using appropriate electrical current injection. We realized a highly efficient single-photon source (SPS) based on well-established semiconductor technology: In a pin structure, a single electron and a single hole are funneled into a single InAs QD using a submicron AlO x current aperture. Efficient radiative recombination leads to emission of single polarized photons with an all-time record purity of the spectrum. Non-classicality of the emitted light without using additional spectral filtering is demonstrated. The out-coupling efficiency and the emission rate are increased by embedding the SPS into a micro-cavity. The design of the micro-cavity is based on detailed modeling to optimize its performance. The resulting resonant single-QD diode is driven at a repetition rate of 1 GHz, exhibiting a second-order correlation function of g (2) (0) = 0.

Intrinsic symmetry-lowering effects leading to the splitting of the exciton bright states are shown to be absent for this substrate orientation.

"We demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, a Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) sensor that is able to operate with a probe power larger than the Brillouin threshold of the deployed sensing fiber and that is free from detrimental nonlocal effects. The technique is based on a dual-probe-sideband setup in which an optical frequency modulation of the probe waves along the fiber is introduced. This makes the optical frequency of the Brillouin interactions induced by each probe wave on the pump vary along the fiber so that two broadband Brillouin gain and loss spectra that perfectly compensate are created. As a consequence, the pulse spectral components remain undistorted, avoiding nonlocal effects. Therefore, very large probe power can be injected, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in detection for long-range BOTDA. Moreover, the probe power can even exceed the Brillouin threshold limit due to its frequency modulation, which reduces the effective amplification of spontaneous Brillouin scattering in the fiber. Experiments demonstrate the technique in a 50-km sensing link in which 8 dBm of probe power is injected.","['Time-domain analysis', 'Brillouin scattering', 'Frequency modulation', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical pulses', 'Optical pumping', 'Optical distortion']","['Brillouin distributed sensors', 'Brillouin optical time domain analysis', 'non-local effects', 'Brillouin threshold', 'optical fiber sensors', 'stimulated Brillouin scattering']"

"We compare the energy consumption of digital optical and digital electronic signal processing circuits, including the contributions to energy consumption of the optical to electrical (O/E) converters and electrical to optical (E/O) converters, and the demultiplexers (DEMUXs) and multiplexers (MUXs) required for electronic circuits to process high-speed optical signals. This paper focuses on three key practical considerations, namely, energy consumption, energy density, and the complexity of processing. We show that optical signal processing is potentially competitive with electronics in very high-speed circuits that provide only limited processing, i.e., when only a small number of processing operations are performed on each bit of data. However, in applications that require anything more than limited processing, electronics provides better energy efficiency and occupies a smaller footprint. In these applications, electronics is likely to remain the technology of choice. More attention needs to be paid to energy consumption issues in the research and development of new digital optical technologies.",[],[]

"A multiband bandpass microwave photonic filter (MPF) whose passband number and position can be selected is theoretically analyzed and experimentally demonstrated. The proposed MPF is based on a wide-band optical source (WBOS) and a two-order high-birefringence fiber loop mirror (HB-FLM), which serves as a slicing filter. Two segments of high-birefringence fiber (HBF) with the lengths of 3 m and 6 m are used in the HB-FLM, and three typical spectral periods or their combinations can be independently achieved by simply adjusting the polarization controllers (PCs) in the HB-FLM. Subsequently, the light source is sliced with uniform or mixing wavelength spacing. A coil of single-mode fiber (SMF) is then used to act as a dispersive medium to introduce time delay between taps. Thus, a single or multiband bandpass response is obtained at the output of a high-speed photodetector (PD). In addition, the passband centered at dc frequency is removed due to the use of phase modulation.

"A scheme to realize a high linear analog photonic link based on a dual-parallel Mach–Zehnder modulator (DPMZM) is proposed and demonstrated in this paper. By using only two electrical phase shifters with \pi phase shift and optimizing the biases of the DPMZM, the third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) is completely eliminated by taking all the sidebands in the optical spectrum that produce IMD3 into consideration in theory. Without digital linearization, other optical processers, and symmetrical single-sideband modulation, optical carrier suppression (OCS) is achieved in one of the submodulators of DPMZM, which guarantees the effectiveness of information transmission. Quadrature modulation is achieved in the other submodulator of DPMZM, and the electrical signals on the two electrodes are the same, which result in a simple operation.

An optical fiber thermal anemometer is proposed based on a silver film-coated fiber Bragg grating (FBG) assisted by a core offset fusion splice.

"We report experimental observations and numerical simulation results on the spectrum moving, narrowing, broadening, and wavelength switching of dissipative solitons (DSs) in an all-normal-dispersion Yb-fiber laser that is passively mode-locked by using the nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) technique. We found numerically that the DS spectrum moving, together with spectrum narrowing/broadening, is caused by the effective gain profile change resulted from the moving of the artificial spectral filter. Furthermore, we show that the wavelength switching observed in the laser is a natural consequence of the effective gain switching. The moving of the artificial spectral filter could be originated from either the cavity birefringence change or the polarizer rotation. Due to the broad gain and the artificial birefringent filter introduced by the NPR technique, apart from the central wavelength shifting and bandwidth changing, wavelength switching of DSs could be obtained by simply rotating the polarizer. Numerical simulations well reproduced the experimental observations. Our results suggest that extra effort should be made for wavelength tuning if there is any polarization-dependent component in the cavity as the wavelength switching will interrupt the continuously wavelength shift.","['Optical fiber polarization', 'Band-pass filters', 'Optical fiber dispersion', 'Laser mode locking', 'Cavity resonators', 'Bandwidth', 'Tuning']","['Spectrum moving', 'wavelength switching', 'dissipative soliton', 'fiber lasers', 'all-normal-dispersion']"

"Phase modulation is one of the key functionalities in an integrated photonics circuit. In the silicon photonics platform, several approaches have been undertaken. The thermooptic effect is slow and relatively power hungry, whereas a carrier-based approach is fast ( > Gb/s) but lossy and weak. Integration of other (e.g., electrooptic) materials typically struggles with fabrication issues that limit the effect. Here, we present a nanoelectromechanical systems-based approach. By applying a voltage over a freestanding slot waveguide, the slot width will change, resulting in an effective index change and thus a phase change. Using a cascaded structure, the effect can be enlarged without reducing the speed. A phase change of 40 ^{\circ} was observed for a voltage of 13 V over a cascade of three 5.8- \mu\hbox{m} -long freestanding slots.

"We present a timing jitter and amplitude noise characterization of a high-power mode-locked integrated external-cavity surface emitting laser (MIXSEL). In the MIXSEL, the semiconductor saturable absorber of a SESAM is integrated into the structure of a VECSEL to start and stabilize passive mode-locking. In comparison to previous noise characterization of SESAM-mode-locked VECSELs, this first noise characterization of a MIXSEL is performed at a much higher average output power. In a free-running operation, the laser generates 14.3-ps pulses at an average output power of 645 mW at a 2-GHz pulse repetition rate and an RMS amplitude noise of 0.15% [1 Hz, 10 MHz]. We measured an RMS timing jitter of 129 fs [100 Hz, 10 MHz], which represents the lowest value for a free-running passively mode-locked semiconductor disk laser to date. Additionally, we stabilized the pulse repetition rate with a piezo actuator to control the cavity length. With the laser generating 16.7-ps pulses at an average output power of 701 mW, the repetition frequency was phase-locked to a low-noise electronic reference using a feedback loop. In actively stabilized operation, the RMS timing jitter was reduced to less than 70 fs [1 Hz, 100 MHz]. In the 100-Hz to 10-MHz bandwidth, we report the lowest timing jitter measured from a passively mode-locked semiconductor disk laser to date with a value of 31 fs.

"Reflection and transmission modes are studied in a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor, where a nanohole-array-patterned gold film is deposited on a glass substrate, and the analyte in an aqueous medium is bound onto the patterned gold film. The reflection (transmission) mode means that light illuminates the structure from the analyte (substrate) side, and the detection is fixed at the analyte side. The two modes are studied by calculating absorption (and transmission) spectra and optical field distributions of the sensor. This study shows that both modes can excite the SPR on the analyte/gold interface, which is useful for sensing. However, the optical field distribution at the resonant wavelength is different for the two modes, and the effect is dependent on the gold film thickness. Comparing the sensing performance, the reflection mode gives larger resonant optical field enhancements (32 as compared with 22), but the transmission mode uses much thinner gold films (60 nm as compared with 150 nm).

"A directional coupler structure formed by a nematic liquid crystal (NLC)-filled photonic crystal fiber (PCF) represents a promising configuration in sensing applications. Because of large refractive index difference between the NLC and silica material, the mode coupling between the NLC waveguide and the silica core is more complicated than the situation of coupling between two fundamental modes of the waveguides.

In this paper, we present a thorough analysis, both theoretically and experimentally, of the directional coupler structure, including the mode properties, coupling characteristics, and thermal sensing properties. The temperature response of the device is experimentally measured, showing a polynomial curve in nematic phase and a linear curve in isotropic phase. The nonlinearity of the temperature response of the device in nematic phase and the linearity in isotropic phase are attributed to the temperature dependence of the refractive index of the NLC.

With net-normal dispersion, the experimental laser, operating in a dissipative soliton resonance region, generates stable rectangular pulses. The pulsewidth varies from 480 ps to 6.19 ns with the increasing pump power, and its center wavelength has a 28.95-nm tunable range (from 1940.22 to 1969.17 nm) by properly adjusting the polarization controllers. The maximum of average output power and pulse energy is 60.73 mW and 19.51 nJ, respectively. The rectangular pulses have a clamped peak power of about 3.16 W.

"We present the design and experimental demonstration of a contra-directional grating-coupled racetrack resonator exhibiting the Vernier effect. The device consists of two racetrack resonators that are coupled together in a cascaded configuration. The input coupler in each racetrack resonator of the cascaded configuration consists of contra-directional gratings. The benefit of using contra-directional couplers is their small bandwidth, as compared to co-directional couplers that do not have gratings. The simulation results show that this device provides numerous performance advantages compared to cascaded racetrack resonators exhibiting the Vernier effect without contra-directional grating couplers. Specifically, we eliminate the free spectral range (FSR, i.e., in both the drop port and the through port) and show substantial improvement in the interstitial peak suppression and the through port insertion loss for the cascaded racetrack resonator with gratings, as compared to the case without gratings. In addition, experimental results are presented, which show an interstitial peak suppression of 29.3 dB, as well as the elimination of the FSR in the drop port and the through port.","['Gratings', 'Couplers', 'Couplings', 'Optical waveguides', 'Ports (Computers)', 'Optical ring resonators']","['Silicon nanophotonics', 'gratings', 'waveguide devices']"
"In this paper, we report a novel fiber-optic Fabry-Perot interferometric (FFPI) temperature sensor based on the difference of thermal expansion coefficient between fused silica and metallic materials. The sensor head is made by a single-mode fiber (SMF). A gold film and a nickel film are sputtered and electroplated on the surface of the SMF. Then, a microcavity is micromachined by focused ion beam (FIB) milling. Because the thermal expansion coefficient of nickel is about 20 times of fused silica, the different thermal expansions force the sensor head to bend when the temperature is high or low. Its temperature sensitivity is over 14 pm/°C in a wide range from -79°C to +70°C. And the coefficient of determination R 2 is excellent (over 0.995). Moreover, the metallic cylinder can reinforce the cavity spot of the fiber sensor, so that this kind of sensor can work in harsh environments. For the first time to the best of our knowledge, we report this type of FFPI temperature sensor based on difference of thermal expansion coefficient between fused silica and metallic materials.","['Temperature sensors', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Cavity resonators', 'Temperature measurement', 'Optical fibers', 'Silicon compounds', 'Thermal expansion']","['Fabry–Perot interferometric (FFPI)', 'fiber sensor', 'thermal expansion coefficient', 'focused ion beam milling']"
"A pumping-power-dependent high-order harmonic mode-locking erbium-doped fiber laser (HML-EDFL) with a single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-doped polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based saturable absorber is investigated. The HML-EDFL systems using either all-physical-contact (PC) or all-angled-physical-contact (APC) connectors examined in this study show stably mode-locked pulse trains; however, the all-PC connector-based system requires a larger pumping power to initiate the mode-locking and generate a broader pulsewidth of 2.9–5.2 ps at same HML order. The all-APC connector-based HML-EDFL system can provide pulsewidth shortening from 3.8 to 1.9 ps associated with a spectral linewidth broadened from 0.7 to 1.36 nm by increasing the HML order from first to sixth. Either the all-PC or the all-APC connector-based EDFLs can deliver a nearly transform-limited pulse with a time–bandwidth product (TBP) of 0.32. The EDFL passively mode-locked by SWCNT-doped PVA delivers a pulse train with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) remaining higher than 40 dB for different HML orders, whereas the side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) lower than 32 dB inevitably introduces an unequalized peak amplitude phenomenon for adjacent pulses at higher HML operations. A modified Haus' master equation is derived to explain the inverse proportionality of the passive HML-EDFL pulsewidth to the square root of HML order, which is correlated with the shortened carrier recombination time of the SWCNT saturable absorber at higher pumping power or circulating pulse intensity.","['Connectors', 'Cavity resonators', 'Laser mode locking', 'Erbium-doped fiber lasers', 'Carbon nanotubes', 'Pump lasers']","['Carbon nanotubes and confined systems', 'mode-locked lasers', 'erbium lasers', 'fiber lasers']"

Coarse and fine tunability of the MMW and THz signals from 117 to 954 GHz is also demonstrated by injecting the external light into different residual modes of the QD laser and by controlling the injection strength and the initial frequency detuning.","['Optical attenuators', 'Laser modes', 'Optical mixing', 'Optical reflection', 'Quantum dot lasers']","['Semiconductor lasers', 'quantum dot lasers', 'millimeter-wave', 'THz', 'signal generation']"

"Quarter-wave operation or a phase shift of more than π/2, which is approximately ten times greater than that reported in previous works using liquid crystals (LCs) and graphene electrodes, was demonstrated. The device is transparent to the terahertz (THz) wave, and the driving voltage required was as low as approximately 2.2 V (rms), which is also unprecedented. Experimental results supported a theoretical formalism adapted for LC cells with THz wavelength-scale thickness. The scattering rate, DC mobility, and carrier mean free path of bilayer graphene were also determined using THz spectroscopic techniques; the parameters were inferior to those of monolayer graphene. This observation can be attributed to the higher density of charged impurities in the bilayer graphene.

"This paper mainly focuses on efficient schemes for simulating propagation in optical fibers. Various schemes based on split-step Fourier techniques to solve the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE), which describes the propagation in optical fibers, are compared. In general, the schemes in which the loss operator is combined with nonlinearity operator are found to be more computationally efficient than the schemes in which the loss is combined with dispersion. When the global error is large, the schemes with variable step size outperform the ones with uniform step size. The schemes based on local error and/or minimum area mismatch (MAM) further improve the computational efficiency. In this scheme, by minimizing the area mismatch between the exponential profile and its stepwise approximation, an optimal step size distribution is found. The optimization problem is solved by the steepest descent algorithm. The number of steps to get the desired accuracy is determined by the local error method. The proposed scheme is found to have higher computational efficiency than the other schemes studied in this paper. For QPSK systems, when the global error is10−8, the number of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) needed for the conventional scheme (loss combined with dispersion and uniform step size) is 5.8 times that of the proposed scheme.

"The high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) degrades the performance in optical wireless communication systems. This paper proposes a modified asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) with low PAPR via introducing a recoverable upper-clipping (RoC) procedure. Although some information is clipped by a predetermined peak threshold, the clipped error information is kept and repositioned in our proposed scheme, which is named RoC-ACO-OFDM, instead of simply being dropped in conventional schemes. The proposed method makes full use of the specific structure of ACO-OFDM signals in the time domain, where half of the positions are forced to zeros within an OFDM symbol. The zero-valued positions are utilized to carry the clipped error information. Moreover, we accordingly present an optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection for the RoC-ACO-OFDM system. To facilitate the usage of RoC-ACO-OFDM in practical applications, an efficient detection method is further developed with near-optimal performance.

By detailedly analyzing the profiles of energy band diagrams, distributions of carrier concentration, and electron current density, the advantages of Al-content graded Al x Ga 1-x N EBL are attributed to the resulting lower resistivity, higher barrier for electron leakage, and simultaneously reduced barrier for hole injection compared with the conventional EBL with constant Al composition.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Aluminum gallium nitride', 'Charge carrier processes', 'III-V semiconductor materials', 'Gallium nitride', 'Electric potential']","['III-Nitride', 'graded AlGaN electron blocking layer', 'ultraviolet light-emitting diodes']"

"We proposed and experimentally demonstrated a wavelength-space division multiplexing (WSDM) optical access network architecture with centralized optical carrier delivery utilizing multicore fibers (MCFs) and adaptive modulation based on reflective semiconductor amplifier (RSOA). In our experiment, five of the outer cores are used for undirectional downstream (DS) transmission only, whereas the remaining outer core is utilized as a dedicated channel to transmit upstream (US) signals. Optical carriers for US are delivered from the optical line terminal (OLT) to the optical network unit (ONU) via the inner core and then transmitted back to the OLT after amplification and modulation by the RSOA in the colorless ONU side. The mobile backhaul (MB) service is also supported by the inner core. Wavelengths used in US transmission should be different from that of the MB in order to avoid the Rayleigh backscattering effect in bidirectional transmission. With quadrature phase-shift keying--orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (QPSK-OFDM) modulation format, the aggregation DS capacity reaches 250 Gb/s using five outer cores and ten wavelengths, and it can be further scaled to 1 Tb/s using 20 wavelengths modulated with 16 QAM-OFDM. For US transmission, 2.5 Gb/s QPSK-OFDM transmission can be achieved just using a low-bandwidth RSOA, and adaptive modulation is applied to the RSOA to further enhance the US data rate to 3.12 Gb/s. As an emulation of high-speed MB transmission, 48 Gb/s in-phase and quadrature (IQ) modulated popularization division multiplexing (PDM)-QPSK signal is transmitted in the inner core of MCF and coherently detected in the OLT side.

The different regimes that occur as the reverse bias voltage applied to the saturable absorber (SA) section or the bias current injected into the amplifier section are characterized both in the time and frequency/wavelength domains. Our results reveal that the lasers display spectral competition between the gain of the amplifier section and the absorption of the SA, with variations of the lasing wavelength up to 25 nm as the bias conditions are changed. These wavelength variations result from the thermal drift of the SA band-edge due to Joule heating by the generated photocurrent and from the competition between two possible lasing regions placed either at the amplifier gain peak or near the band-edge of the SA.

"This paper demonstrates a flexible bandwidth-modulation-capable and bandwidth scalable transmitter and receiver technique based on dynamic optical arbitrary waveform generation (OAWG) and measurement (OAWM). This technique generates and receives broadband arbitrary optical waveforms by dividing the waveform spectrum into overlapping spectral slices of bandwidth manageable with existing electronics. The OAWG transmitter produced 2-ns, 60-GHz data waveforms using only 5.5 GHz of analog bandwidth by coherently combining six 10-GHz spectral slices. Measurements were performed using an OAWM receiver with two 30-GHz spectral slices using 15 GHz of analog bandwidth. Experimental demonstrations verify the modulation format independence and flexible bandwidth capabilities of OAWG transmitters and OAWM receivers through the generation of the following waveforms: binary phase-shifted keying (BPSK), coherent wavelength division multiplexing (CoWDM) with 5 and 15 BPSK subcarriers, and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with 54 BPSK subcarriers.

"Transmission of light through periodic metal films with intensity considerably exceeding that predicted by aperture theory is referred to as extraordinary optical transmission (EOT). The mechanisms responsible for this effect have been investigated intensively during the past decade. Here, we show an elegant method of visualizing the operative physical mechanisms for model resonance systems. By numerically mapping the resonance loci, modal and plasmonic mechanisms emerge clearly with delineated regions of dominance. Thus, the photonic transmission resonances are parametrically correlated with localized electromagnetic fields forming pure surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs), coexisting plasmonic and cavity-mode (CM) states, and pure CMs. This mapping method renders a consistent picture of the transitions between photonic states in terms of key parameters. It shows how the TM 1 CM seamlessly morphs into the odd SPP mode as the film thickness diminishes. Similarly, the TM 0 mode converts to the even SPP mode. At the intersection of these mode curves, an EOT-free gap forms due to their interaction. On account of a reflection phase shift of a slit-guided mode, an abrupt transition of the resonance loci in the SPP/CM region is observed.","['Dispersion', 'Metals', 'Resonant frequency', 'Cavity resonators', 'Optical films', 'Optical reflection']","['Plasmonics', 'subwavelength structures', 'waveguides', 'gratings', 'nanocavities', 'optical properties of photonic materials']"

"This paper reports fabrication, characterization, and testing of the thermal stability of ZnO-based Schottky ultraviolet photodetectors. The ZnO thin film was grown on a p-type Si 〈100〉 substrate by the sol-gel technique. The surface morphological and the structural properties of the thin film were studied by an atomic force microscope (AFM) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). For the investigation of the surface chemical bonding, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were also performed. The I - V characteristics of the Schottky barrier photodetector were studied, and the parameters such as ideality factor, leakage current, and barrier height were extracted from the measured data at room temperature. With applied bias voltages in the range from -3 to 3 V, the contrast ratio, responsivity, detectivity, and quantum efficiency of the photodetectors were measured for an incident optical power of 0.1 mW at 365-nm wavelength. The electrical and optical study revealed that the performance of the device improves with increasing post metal deposition annealing temperature up to 100°C. The device exhibited excellent thermal stability in the annealing temperature range of 100°C to 200°C. For annealing temperatures beyond 200°C, the performance of the device degrades drastically. It was also found that at under 200°C, there is a harmonious correlation between the photoresponse and electrical characteristics of the device. Above this temperature, there is no correlation between the variations of photoresponse and electrical characteristics with increasing annealing temperature.

We demonstrate use of the beam propagation method (BPM) to analyze beam distortion in GRIN-lensed fibers resulting from index profiles that exhibit a deviation from the ideal parabolic shape or artifacts such as ripples or a central dip. Furthermore, we demonstrate the power of this method for exploring novel probe designs that incorporate GRIN phase masks to generate wavefront-shaped output beams with extended depth-of-focus (DOF). We present results using our method that are in good agreement with experimental data. The BPM enables accurate simulation of fiber probes using non-ideal or custom-engineered GRIN fibers with arbitrary refractive index profiles, which is important in the design of high-performance fiber-based micro-imaging systems for biomedical applications.","['Probes', 'Indexes', 'Refractive index', 'Lenses', 'Numerical models', 'Optical imaging', 'Optical sensors']","['Biomedical optical imaging', 'optical microscopy']"

"During the indoor visible light communication (VLC) channel modeling procedure, the transmitter constituted by an array of light-emitting diodes (LED's) is frequently modeled as a single point source for convenience. However, how accurate this simplified treatment is remains unanswered. This paper compares the channel characteristics of both the simplified point-source model and six practical cases having various numbers of LEDs. Our numerical results show that the deviations in terms of the channel's optical path loss (OPL), as well as its bandwidth and the channel's delay spread, are steadily increased upon increasing the number of LEDs of each transmitter, until LEDs spread almost over the entire ceiling. Even in the worst case, the deviation of the OPL remains below 0.41 dBo, whereas that of the 3-dB transmission bandwidth is below 1.67 MHz. However, the deviation in terms of the root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread can reach 1.88 ns.

"A bilayered-twisted Fermat's spiral chiral metamaterial (FSCMM) is proposed for the realization of circular polarization of far-infrared waves and polarization filters. It is demonstrated through full-wave simulations that the proposed FSCMM can convert waves from linear to circular polarization (CP) around 2.5 THz. The reported FSCMM is sensitive to the handedness of circularly polarized light, where it can filter out either righthanded or left-handed CP light with an optical isolation of 35 dB around 2.5 THz. The proposed FSCMM is compact with a dimension of λ/4 × λ/4 × λ/9 at the far-infrared operating waveband. The CP conversion and filtering functionalities of the proposed FSCMM are ensured for oblique incidences up to 200 with an optical isolation of more than 25 dB for both xand y-oriented linear polarized excitations. The operation bandwidth of the proposed system is enhanced in the level of 0.058 THz to 0.11 THz for twoand three-unit-cell composite systems, respectively.

Attosecond pulses are now available in many different labs with additional gating techniques which somewhat relax the requirements for the pulse duration of the intense infrared laser pulses.

"We consider the design of photonic circuits that make use of Ti:LiNbO 3 diffused channel waveguides to generate photons with various combinations of modal, spectral, and polarization entanglement. Down-converted photon pairs are generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a two-mode waveguide (TMW). We study a class of photonic circuits comprising: 1) a nonlinear periodically poled TMW structure; 2) a set of single-mode waveguide (SMW)- and TMW-based couplers arranged in such a way that they suitably separate the three photons comprising the SPDC process; and, for some applications, 3) a holographic Bragg grating that acts as a dichroic reflector. The first circuit produces two frequency-degenerate down-converted photons, each with even spatial parity, in two separate SMWs. Changing the parameters of the elements allows this same circuit to produce two nondegenerate down-converted photons that are entangled in frequency or simultaneously entangled in frequency and polarization. The second photonic circuit is designed to produce modal entanglement by distinguishing the photons on the basis of their frequencies. A modified version of this circuit can be used to generate photons that are doubly entangled in mode number and polarization. The third photonic circuit is designed to manage dispersion by converting modal, spectral, and polarization entanglement into path entanglement.","['Circuits', 'Optical waveguides', 'Photonics', 'Frequency', 'Optical polarization', 'Quantum computing', 'Holography', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Optical computing', 'Holographic optical components']","['Photonic circuits', 'integrated-optics devices', 'channel waveguides', 'waveguide couplers', 'parametric down-conversion', 'quantum optics', 'nonlinear optics', 'entangled photons', 'dispersion management']"
"We report a photonic approach to generating radio-frequency (RF) waveforms based on a dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator (DPMZM) driven by a sinusoidal RF signal. One of the sub-MZMs (MZM1) of the DPMZM is driven by the sinusoidal RF signal, whereas the other sub-MZM (MZM2) has no driven signal. In this way, the powers of even- and odd-order sidebands can be separately controlled by adjusting the bias of the MZM1. The power ratio between the odd- (or even-) order sidebands is tunable by adjusting the RF power. Moreover, the power and the phase of the optical carrier can be independently tunable by adjusting the biases of the MZM2 and the parent MZM of the DPMZM, respectively. After detecting by a photodetector, an RF signal with controllable harmonics is generated. Thus, a desired RF waveform can be generated by separately manipulating its harmonics. The proposed method is theoretically analyzed. In addition, proof-of-concept experiments are carried out to generate triangular and rectangular waveforms with repetition rates of 5 and 10 GHz.","['Radio frequency', 'Optical filters', 'Harmonic analysis', 'Amplitude modulation', 'Power harmonic filters', 'Optical fibers']","['Radio-frequency waveform generation', 'dual-parallel Mach–Zehnder modulator']"

"We propose a novel scheme for quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulated vector signal generation based on photonic heterodyne beating, phase precoding, and optical carrier suppression (OCS). Different from our previous OCS-based vector signal generation schemes, in our proposed scheme, the precoded vector signal at the radio-frequency (RF) band, which is used for the drive of the intensity modulator operating at its OCS point, is generated by photonic heterodyning beating rather than a single digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Photonic heterodyne beating accomplishes the upconversion of the precoded vector signal from the baseband to the RF band, and thus, the DAC in our proposed scheme is used to generate the precoded vector signal at the baseband rather than that at the RF band, which significantly reduces the DAC bandwidth requirement. We experimentally demonstrate 17.6-GHz QPSK modulated vector signal generation based on our proposed scheme. The generated 17.6-GHz vector signal can carry up to 3-GBd QPSK data with a bit error ratio (BER) less than the hard-decision forward-error-correction (HD-FEC) threshold of3.8×10−3.","['Photonics', 'Phase shift keying', 'Optical modulation', 'Bandwidth', 'Frequency modulation', 'Optical mixing']","['Photonic vector signal generation', 'photonic heterodyne beating', 'phase precoding', 'optical carrier suppression (OCS)', 'quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)']"

We use a fiber-coupled multimode 808-nm pump diode, which is mounted inside the laser housing. No active cavity length stabilization is employed. The phase noise of the free-running laser integrated over a bandwidth from 100 Hz to 1 MHz corresponds to an RMS timing jitter of ≈212 fs, which is lower than previously obtained for mode-locked VECSELs. This clearly confirms the superior noise performance expected from a high-Q-cavity semiconductor laser.

"The optical carrier generation is the basic building block to implement all-optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission. One method to optically generate single and multicarriers is to use the microring resonator (MRR). The MRRs can be used as filter devices, where generation of high-frequency (GHz) soliton signals as single and multicarriers can be performed using suitable system parameters. Here, the optical soliton in a nonlinear fiber MRR system is analyzed, using a modified add/drop system known as a Panda ring resonator connected to an add/drop system. In order to set up a transmission system, i.e., IEEE802.11a, first, 64 uniform optical carriers were generated and separated by a splitter and modulated; afterward, the spectra of the modulated optical subcarriers are overlapped, which results one optical OFDM channel band. The quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and 16-QAM are used for modulating the subcarriers. The generated OFDM signal is multiplexed with a single-carrier soliton and transmitted through the single-mode fiber (SMF). After photodetection, the radio frequency (RF) signal was propagated. On the receiver side, the RF signal was optically modulated and processed. The results show the generation of 64 multicarriers evenly spaced in the range from 54.09 to 55.01 GHz, where demodulation of these signals is performed, and the performance of the system is analyzed.","['Optical ring resonators', 'OFDM', 'Optical solitons', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Optical filters', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical transmitters']","['Panda ring resonator', 'soliton carriers', 'IEEE802.11a', 'OFDM']"

"Precise and secure time synchronization between two remote sites is necessary in many practical scenarios. Recently, the two-way fiber time transfer (TWFTT) system has become an attractive option for high-precision time synchronization. However, TWFTT is implemented based on symmetric link assumption, and such assumption may be maliciously utilized to cause significant time asynchronization to TWFTT. In this paper, we propose two novel controllable asymmetry attack schemes for TWFTT, namely, the link asymmetry attack and the attenuation asymmetry attack. We theoretically analyze the controllability and the effectiveness of these two attacks. Experimental results show that our link asymmetry attack can introduce 2.49 ns time offset per asymmetric link length (in meters), and our attenuation asymmetry attack can introduce at most 36.6 times time offset (compared to normal situation) when the attenuation is 45.3%.

"Integrated optical affinity sensors based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) enable sensitive and label-free detection of chemical and biological molecules.

Moreover, the direction of phase change cannot be unambiguously determined with these sensors. Here, we present a coherent detection scheme based on integrated optics that enables unambiguous readout of the optical phase with a constant sensitivity. Our approach furthermore cancels the effect of imperfections in the sensor hardware using a blind calibration scheme.

"By controlling the polarization state of a simple ring erbium-doped fiber laser with photonics crystal fiber, polarization controller (PC) and tunable band-pass filter, this paper demonstrates stable operation of narrow spacing dual-wavelength fiber laser (DWFL). The flexibility of the tunable band-pass filter and PC allows the spacing tuning of the DWFL from 80 pm up to 600 pm. Such tuning ability offers flexibility in the application of DWFL, particularly in tunable microwave generation and radio over fiber. Throughout the experiment, the DWFL shows high power stability within 0.6 dB and wavelength shift of less than 10 pm. In addition to that, it also produces a narrow linewidth optical output of 3 pm with a high signal to noise ratio of more than 60 dB.","['Optical fiber polarization', 'Erbium-doped fiber lasers', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Laser tuning', 'Measurement by laser beam']","['Dual-wavelength', 'erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL)', 'narrow spacing', 'polarization dependent loss (PDL)']"

"A very electrically small, active open cylindrical coated nanoparticle model is constructed, and its electromagnetic properties are investigated in the visible frequency band. Its optical response under both planewave and electric dipole antenna excitations shows very strong dipole behavior at its lowest resonance frequency. The scattering cross section at that dipole resonance frequency is increased by more than +50 dBsm for the planewave excitation. When the open structure is excited by a small current (I0 = 1 ×10 -3 A) driven dipole antenna, the maximum radiated power of the composite nanoantenna can be increased by +83.35 dB over its value obtained when the dipole antenna radiates alone in free space. The behaviors under various locations and orientations of the dipole are explored. Dipole orientations along the cylinder axis and symmetric locations of the dipole produced the largest radiated power enhancements.","['Nanobioscience', 'Resonant frequency', 'Materials', 'Permittivity', 'Metals', 'Optical scattering']","['Electrically small antennas', 'metamaterials', 'nanoantenna', 'nanostructures', 'plasmonics', 'radiation', 'scattering']"

Thanks to the wide bandwidth of the PM, high-speed phase modulation of the microwave pulse can be realized.

"Metamaterial-based perfect absorbers have attracted considerable attention due to their potential for practical applications. The existing absorbers, however, are mostly polarization insensitive or only sensitive to one direction, which is inapplicable in some areas. Polarization tunable or high absorption in two orthogonal directions is very useful and necessary. Herein, we present a polarization tunable absorber formed by an asymmetric patch and a dielectric layer on top of a metallic board. With this structure, the frequency of the absorber can be tuned by merely changing the polarization of the incident. The tunable mechanism originates from the different length of the patch along the two orthogonal directions. The concept is rather general and applicable to various absorbers, as long as the asymmetric design is valid. The absorber can find practical applications in manipulation of the polarization of the light and detecting waves with specific polarization.","['Absorption', 'Broadband communication', 'Dual band', 'Metamaterials', 'Dielectrics', 'Magnetic resonance']","['Metamaterial', 'perfect absorber', 'polarization tunable', 'terahertz']"
"The design of a new graphene-based continuously tunable optical delay line formed by two vertically stacked microring resonators coupled to a straight waveguide is proposed. High values of delay time (τ g = 360 ps) and a wide tuning range (Δτ g = 230 ps) have been calculated, due to the graphene sandwiched between the stacked ring resonators, which also provides an electrooptical tuning of the delay with low energy consumption (E switch = 3.4 pJ) and fast switching time (t switch <; 2 ns). The ratio Δrg/A represents an important figure of merit (FOM) for optical delay lines. A value FOM = 1.4 × 10 -1 ps/μm 2 has been calculated, which corresponds to an enhancement of about a factor 4 compared with the state-of-the-art of the integrated optical delay lines, also providing a switching time several times faster. Such performance, together with a small device footprint (<; 1.6 × 10 3 μm 2 ), gives a significant contribution to the state-of-the-art of optical delay lines, confirming the suitability of the graphene-based resonant cavity as a high-efficient optical delay line for applications in which fast tuning and wide range of tunability are required, e.g., phased array antennas.","['Nanomaterials', 'Graphene', 'Cavity resonators', 'Delay lines', 'Optical buffering', 'Optical waveguides', 'Integrated optics']","['Integrated optics devices', 'Coupled resonators', 'Nanomaterials']"

"This paper introduces a method of measuring the delta between the effective refractive index of a silicon waveguide and a waveguide with wider dimensions through the constructive and destructive interference in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The method consists of a fixed effective refractive index variation incorporated by tapering one of the arms in the interferometer to a wider waveguide dimension. The MZI consists of a Y-branch splitter and a multimode interference (MMI) coupler. The Y-branch splitter splits the input light 50/50 into the two arms, and the MMI is used for recombination of the two arms. A change in the effective refractive index of one arm in comparison with the other arm in the interferometer will introduce a phase difference on recombination in the MMI. The MMI has the following three ports: the top and bottom output ports, which are the antisymmetric outputs, and the middle port, which is the symmetric output. When the two signals are in phase, all the light is coupled into the symmetric port, and when the two inputs are π out of phase, the light is coupled 50/50 into the antisymmetric ports.

"A novel photonic approach to generating a frequency-quadrupled millimeter-wave (mm-wave) signal with a tunable phase shift is proposed and demonstrated. Two second-order optical sidebands are generated by using a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) that is biased at the maximum transmission point and an optical notch filter. A polarization-maintaining fiber Bragg grating (PM-FBG) is then utilized to make the two sidebands orthogonally polarized, which are then sent to a polarization modulator (PolM). By aligning the two orthogonally polarized sidebands with the two principal axes of the PolM, complementary phase modulation is thus achieved. By beating the two phase-modulated sidebands at a photodetector, an mm-wave signal is generated and its phase is continuously tunable by tuning the bias voltage to the PolM. An experiment is performed. An mm-wave signal with a frequency tunable from 36 to 52 GHz is generated and its phase is tunable over 360 ° by tuning the bias voltage.","['Amplitude modulation', 'Optical polarization', 'Optical filters', 'Microwave photonics', 'Microwave filters', 'Optical fibers']","['Microwave photonics', 'mm-wave signal generation', 'phase-array beamforming', 'tunable phase shift']"
"Hybrid free-space optical (FSO)/radio-frequency (RF) systems have emerged as a promising solution for high-data-rate wireless communications. In this paper, we consider power adaptation strategies based on truncated channel inversion for the hybrid FSO/RF system employing adaptive combining. Specifically, we adaptively set the RF link transmission power when FSO link quality is unacceptable to ensure constant combined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. Two adaptation strategies are proposed. One strategy depends on the received RF SNR, whereas the other one depends on the combined SNR of both links. Analytical expressions for the outage probability of the hybrid system with and without power adaptation are obtained. Numerical examples show that the hybrid FSO/RF system with power adaptation achieves a considerable outage performance improvement over the conventional system.","['Radio frequency', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Hybrid power systems', 'Atmospheric modeling', 'Adaptive optics', 'Optical receivers']","['Hybrid FSO/RF', 'Gamma-Gamma atmospheric turbulence model', 'Pointing errors', 'Nakagami-m fading model', 'Outage probability', 'MRC combining', 'Power adaptation']"

"It has been widely recognized that the underlying principles of quantum mechanics could be used to enable secure communications, without any additional conventional cryptographic systems, while utilizing the properties of the photons. Considerable research efforts have been invested to develop an efficient quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme over either free-space optical or fiber-optics channels. Most of these research efforts have been focused on a two-dimensional QKD, commonly realized by the use of the polarization state of photons. However, the data rates for the quantum key exchange in two-dimensional QKD are still low, while transmission distance is limited. On the other hand, it is well known that photons can carry both the spin angular momentum (SAM) and the orbital angular momentum (OAM), associated with the polarization and azimuthal phase of the complex electric field, respectively. Accordingly, we can define the combined-OAM-SAM state of a photon as |l, σ〉, where l and σ correspond to OAM and SAM indexes, respectively. Since the OAM eigenstates are orthogonal, an arbitrary number of bits per single photon can be transmitted, which could considerably increase the total secure bit rate. To improve secure data rates, we propose two types of protocols, namely, nonentangled-based (such as weak coherent state) and entanglement-assisted protocols, both employing the photon combined-OAM-SAM state, which can be used for secure key distribution over free-space optical and few-mode fiber channels. Two types of entanglement-assisted protocols are described, namely, two-basis and (D + 1)-basis protocols ( D is dimensionality of corresponding Hilbert space). We further describe how to implement the qudit gates required for implementation of these protocols.

Excellent agreements between numerical simulations and real-time experimental measurements are obtained over a wide diversity of transmission conditions of the aforementioned systems. The physical mechanism underpinning the occurrence of negative power penalties is the reduction in subcarrier intermixing impairment due to the compensation between DML positive frequency chirps and MetroCor negative chromatic dispersions.

Results show scotopic/photopic (S/P) ratios>3.80 and color rendering indices (CRIs)≥70 for three-hump LEDs and S/P ratios>3.90 and CRIs≥70 for four-hump LEDs under a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 45 000 K. Furthermore, for both three- and four-hump LEDs under the condition of CCT>5000 K, optimal results in this paper exhibit capabilities of exceedingS/P=2.50and simultaneously satisfying the criterion of CRI≥70. Our simulation procedure is conducted under variations of nine CCTs, several wavelengths, and peak heights. Optimized results of S/P ratios and CRIs are identified and retained through filtering off a great number of unqualified candidates. Finally, present findings may help improve the quality of eye visions pertaining to LED illumination and help reduce the electrical energy consumption related to LED usage.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Color', 'Rendering (computer graphics)', 'Filtering', 'Indexes', 'Light sources', 'Market research']","['Solid-state lighting', 'light-emitting diodes', 'scotopic/photopic ratios', 'color rendering index', 'luminous efficacy of radiation']"

"We demonstrated the dual-wavelength simultaneously Q-switched Nd: Lu 2 O 3 laser with a topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3 as the Q-switcher. The continuous-wave Nd:Lu 2 O 3 crystal laser with the slope efficiency of 31% was achieved, and the first Nd:Lu 2 O 3 pulsed laser operation was reported, as far as we know. By using the wavelength-insensitive saturable absorption of topological insulators, the dual wavelength of the Nd:Lu 2 O 3 crystal laser can be Q-switched simultaneously without the frequency selection of the saturable absorber, since the emission cross-sections of Nd:Lu 2 O 3 at the wavelengths of 1077 and 1081 nm are comparable. The results indicate that the topological insulator is wavelength-insensitive and should be suitable for the dual-wavelength simultaneously Q-switched laser as a passive Q-switcher.

In light of the upcoming launch of 5G services, this paper aims to evaluate the performance of the FSO system for the implementation of 5G technology in diverse geographical locations of India. The proposed 16 × 10Gbpswavelength division multiplexing (WDM) based FSO link uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and digital signal processing (DSP) module to mitigate channel-induced limitations. Additionally, the proposed FSO design also employs Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) with optimized gain characteristics.

"We report a high-power high-efficiency single-mode all-fiber Raman fiber laser (RFL) operating at 1173 nm. With the core pumped by a 144-W 1120-nm Yb-doped fiber laser, an output power of 119 W at a wavelength of 1173 nm was obtained, corresponding to an optical efficiency of 82%. To the best of our knowledge, it is the highest power at the 1150-1200-nm laser band by using common silica fiber. The optical efficiency of the RFL with high output coupler (OC) reflectivity and short fiber length is discussed. We also carefully measured the output Raman spectrums under different cavity parameters and presented primary analysis. The results show that the bandwidth increases near linearly with laser output power, rather than a square-root law concluded for high Q-value and long-cavity RFLs in previous published literatures. Increasing the length of the gain fiber and the reflectivity of the OC would also broaden the output spectral bandwidth.","['Fiber lasers', 'Optical fiber couplers', 'Pump lasers', 'Power generation', 'Reflectivity', 'Cavity resonators', 'Power lasers']","['Raman fiber laser', 'high power', 'Raman spectrum']"

"We present a detailed characterization of the active area uniformity of InGaAs/InP Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) from two different design iterations. Nonuniformity of the electric field within the device active area has been measured through 2-D scans of detection efficiency and timing response to a pulsed laser. Additionally, we measured the near-infrared luminescence emitted by hot carriers during the avalanche. The nonuniformity is stronger at lower excess bias, with much higher and nonuniform electric field at the edge of the active area than expected, and it is fainter at higher excess bias, due to the saturation of the avalanche triggering efficiency. The main drawbacks are that the detection efficiency is position dependent when the SPAD is not fiber pigtailed and that the temporal response is worse, because of the nonuniform delay in the avalanche build-up across the SPAD active area.","['Photonics', 'Electric fields', 'Indium phosphide', 'Indium gallium arsenide', 'Electric breakdown', 'Tunneling', 'Image edge detection']","['Photodetectors', 'Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs)', 'photon counting', 'near-infrared detector', 'Avalanche Photodiode']"

We provide clear evidence that the topological charges of the shaped SP vortices are dominated by the PAS under all geometrical settings.

"Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a fast-developing biomedical imaging technology suitable for in vivo imaging. PAT in spherical or circular geometry gives good image resolution yet is slow or expensive in signal acquisition and image formation. Reducing the number of detection angles can ameliorate such issues, usually at the expense of image quality. This paper introduces a deconvolution-based algorithm that models the imaging process as a linear and shift-invariant system. As demonstrated by the in vivo experiment, this algorithm not only runs much faster than the back-projection algorithm but also shows stronger robustness in that it provides better image quality when detection angles are sparse. Therefore, this algorithm promises to enable real-time PAT in circular geometry.","['Robustness', 'Image reconstruction', 'Tomography', 'Geometry', 'Optical imaging', 'Biomedical imaging', 'Ultrasonic imaging', 'Image quality', 'Biomedical optical imaging', 'Iterative algorithms']","['Photoacoustic tomography', 'deconvolution reconstruction', 'sparse detection angles', 'real-time imaging', 'circular geometry']"

"This paper introduces a spectral slicing technique that extends the useful spectral range of frequency combs generated through self-phase modulation (SPM) of mode-locked laser pulses. When generating frequency combs by SPM, the spectral range with high-quality carriers is usually limited due to spectral minima carrying too little power. To overcome these limitations, we combine suitable slices of broadened and nonbroadened spectra. The concept was experimentally verified: A total number of 325 consecutive equidistant subcarriers span a bandwidth of 4 THz. All subcarriers have an optical carrier-power-to-noise-power-density ratio (OCNR) larger than 25.8 dB (0.1 nm) and were derived from one mode-locked laser with a mode linewidth of approximately 1 kHz. The signal quality of the comb and in particular of each subcarrier was ultimately tested in a terabit-per-second communication experiment. The comb quality allowed us to transmit 32.5 Tb/s over 225 km with 100 Gb/s dual polarization 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM) signals on each of the subcarriers.","['Optical fibers', 'Fiber nonlinear optics', 'Optical pulses', 'Laser mode locking', 'OFDM']","['Fiber nonlinear optics', 'optical fiber communication', 'optical pulses', 'supercontinuum generation']"

In contrast, despite a larger polarization field, WW LED on FS-GaN shows obviously enhanced peak efficiency and comparable droop compared to the counterpart with 3-nm well.

"We present a novel microwave photonic single-passband filter based on polarization control through simulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). The principle of the filter is based on a vector SBS process, which is different from the previously reported scalar SBS technique. For a radio-frequency (RF) modulated signal launched to the proposed processor, the state of polarization (SOP) of the optical carrier is rotated by 90∘through a two-step SBS process. As a result, the RF signals cannot be recovered in the photodetector (PD). To recover the desirable RF signal, the SOP of the RF modulated sideband is rotated by another pump wave. Since the orthogonal polarization condition between the optical carrier and the sideband is destroyed, the desirable RF signal can be recovered. By adjusting the wavelength of the pump wave, the frequency response of the filter is tunable in a frequency range from∼2 to 20 GHz with out-of-band rejection of∼30 dB and−3 dB bandwidth of∼20 MHz. In addition, for any modulation format, it is converted to the single-sideband (SSB) modulation by the proposed filter. Therefore, the system is expected to be immune to the fiber dispersion-induced power fading. Moreover, it is independent of the modulation formats of the incoming signal wave. The filter structure can be inserted anywhere in conventional fiber-optic links without the need for modifying the link configuration and the transmitter.","['Microwave filters', 'Scattering', 'Optical fiber filters', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical pumping']","['Microwave photonic filter', 'stimulated Brillouin scattering']"

"Chalcogenide optical fibers are currently undergoing intensive investigation with the aim of exploiting the excellent glass transmission and nonlinear characteristics in the near- and mid-infrared for several applications. Further enhancement of these properties can be obtained, for a particular application, with optical fibers specifically designed that are capable of providing low effective area together with a properly tailored dispersion, matching the characteristics of the laser sources used to excite nonlinear effects. Suspended-core photonic crystal fibers are ideal candidates for nonlinear applications, providing small-core waveguides with large index contrast and tunable dispersion. In this paper, the dispersion properties of As 2 S 3 suspended-core fibers are numerically analyzed, taking into account, for the first time, all the structural parameters, including the size and the number of the glass bridges.

By introducing multiple slots in a dielectric waveguide, we found that a much stronger evanescent field could be achieved in the surrounding media while still maintaining good optical confinement. The experimental demonstration of microring resonator sensors using single-mode waveguides having three slots indicates a 5-fold increase in sensitivity for homogeneous sensing and more than 3-fold increase in sensitivity for surface sensing in comparison to those of a waveguide without slots.

"In this paper, we report a comparative study of fiber optic sensors for applications of relative humidity (RH) monitoring in high-radiation environments. In particular, we present investigations carried out since 2011 by our multidisciplinary research group, in collaboration with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva. Our research has been first focused on the development of polyimide-coated fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, and recently, it has been extended to nanoscale metal oxide-coated long-period gratings (LPGs). Experimental tests in the [0-70] %RH range at different temperatures, before and after γ-ionizing radiation exposures, have been carried out to assess the sensors' performances in conditions required in experiments running at CERN. The advantages and disadvantages of the two proposed technologies are discussed in this paper in light of their possible application in high-energy physics environments. In particular, reported results suggest that LPG-based sensors can be preferred in some applications (particularly in presence of very low humidity levels) mainly because they are able to provide very high RH sensitivity (up to 1.4 nm/% RH), which is up to three orders of magnitude higher than that exhibited by FBG-based hygrometers.

From these expressions, we calculate the maximum allowable coupling coefficient for different values of the DMA. We show, for example, that a QSM fiber with an effective area of 250 μm 2 , a coupling coefficient κ ≤ 6 × 10 -4 km -1 , and DMA equal to 4 dB/km offers a 1-dB performance advantage over a reference pure silica core single-mode fiber for spans of 100 km.","['Couplings', 'Optical fiber theory', 'Optical fiber dispersion', 'Optical fiber networks', 'Attenuation']","['Quasi-single mode fiber', 'multipath interference', 'coherent optical communications', 'coupled-mode theory']"
"Silicon waveguides can be functionalized with an organicχ(2)-nonlinear cladding. This complements silicon photonics with the electro-optic (EO) effect originating from the cladding and enables functionalities such as pure phase modulation, parametric amplification, or THz-wave generation. Claddings based on a polymer matrix containing chromophores have been introduced, and their strongχ(2)nonlinearity has already been used to demonstrate ultralow power consuming modulators. However, these silicon–organic hybrid (SOH) devices inherit not only the advantageous properties; these polymer claddings require an alignment procedure called poling and must be operated well below their glass transition temperature. This excludes some applications. In contrast, claddings made from organic crystals come with a different set of properties. In particular, there is no need for poling. This new class of claddings also promises stronger resilience to high temperatures, better long-term stability, and photo-chemical stability. We report on the deposition of an organic crystal cladding of N-benzyl-2-methyl-4-nitroaniline (BNA) on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides, which have a CMOS-like metal stack on top. Adhering to such an architecture, which preserves the principal advantage of using CMOS-based silicon photonic fabrication processes, permits the first demonstration of high-speed modulation at 12.5 Gbit/s in this material class, which proves the availability of the EO effect from BNA on SOI also for other applications.","['Crystals', 'Silicon', 'Electrooptical waveguides', 'Electrooptic modulators', 'Glass']","['Silicon-organic hybrid', 'silicon-on-insulator', 'photonic integrated circuit', 'modulator', 'organic crystal', 'electro-optic']"

Different polarization states experience different LC cladding indices. The transmittance contrast between the x- and y-polarized modes reaches 31.9 dB, which is sensitive enough to monitor any polarization state change in the fiber. A pressure sensor with the sensitivity of 0.25 rad/N is thus demonstrated. The corresponding stress-optic coefficient of the fiber is measured at 1550-nm telecomm band.

"Recently, it was revealed that conventional gradient metasurfaces are fundamentally limited on their overall efficiency to reroute the impinging waves towards arbitrary directions in reflection and transmission. Their efficiency is particularly limited for extreme wavefront transformations. In addition, due to the fastly varying impedance profiles that these surfaces require, they usually need high-resolution fabrication processes, limiting their applicability and overall bandwidth of operation. To address these issues, the concept of metagrating was recently introduced, enabling engineered surfaces capable of manipulating light with unitary efficiency even in the limit of extreme wavefront manipulation. Metagratings are periodic or locally periodic arrays operated in the few-diffraction order regime. Their unit cell contains carefully designed scatterers that, in contrast with conventional metasurfaces, do not need to support a continuous gradient of surface impedance, and consequently are far simpler to fabricate and can afford broader bandwidths because of the larger footprint of the constituent elements. Tailoring the coupling towards the few available diffraction channels, metagratings enable wavefront transformations with high efficiency. In this paper, we review the physical mechanisms behind the functionality of metagratings and provide an overview and outlook of the recent progress in this field of science and technology.","['Reflection', 'Metasurfaces', 'Surface impedance', 'Surface waves', 'Impedance', 'Surface treatment', 'Mirrors']","['Diffraction', 'Metagratings', 'Metasurfaces']"

"We investigate the effect of optical self-feedback on the timing jitter of a passively mode-locked (ML) laser and compare the von Linde method with two pure time domain methods for calculating the timing jitter of such a system. We find that all three methods yield the same dependence of the timing jitter on the external cavity roundtrip time (delay time). Of these methods, the so-called long term jitter method is significantly less computationally expensive. We therefore use this method to investigate the influence of the delay time, feedback strength, and amplitude-phase coupling on the timing jitter. Our results show that, with vanishing amplitude-phase coupling, greater timing jitter reduction can be achieved with long delay times and larger feedback strengths, when feedback is near resonance. Off resonance, the timing jitter is increased. Non-vanishing amplitude-phase coupling can lead to destabilized pulse stream, even at the feedback main resonances.","['Timing jitter', 'Cavity resonators', 'Optical feedback', 'Laser feedback', 'Laser mode locking', 'Delays']","['Semiconductor lasers', 'laser mode locking', 'optical feedback']"
"The performances of the decode-and-forward (DF) multihop free-space optical communication system with exponentiated Weibull distribution considering the fading induced by pointing error have been studied. With Meijer's G-function, the probability density function (PDF) of the aggregated channel model and the closed-form expression for the average bit error rate (ABER) of binary pulse position modulation are derived. The average bit-error-rate performance is then investigated with different hop numbersH, turbulence strength values, receiver aperture sizes, beamwidths, and jitter variances. Compared with the case without pointing error, the mitigation effect of aperture averaging for fading is more significant over the aggregated channel, regardless of the selectedH, and it is less effective for the degradation induced by the increase inH, which can be restrained by larger beamwidth and lower jitter. The outage probability is also investigated, and the results show that aperture averaging has less of an effect on the outage probability under moderate turbulence than that under the weak turbulence condition at a given value ofH, which is different from the scenario without pointing error. After this, the end-to-end average capacity is analyzed.

"Detailed statistical investigations of the effectiveness of three widely adopted optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OOFDM) adaptive loading algorithms, including power loading (PL), bit loading, and bit-and-power loading (BPL), are undertaken, for the first time, over 1000 statistically constructed worst-case multimode fiber (MMF) links without incorporating inline optical amplification. It is shown that the BPL (PL) algorithm always offers the best (worst) transmission performance. The absolute transmission capacity differences between these algorithms are independent of signal bit rate and increase with both transmission distance and digital-to-analog converter/analog-to-digital converter (DAC/ADC) sampling rate. More importantly, numerical results also indicate that, for both worst-case and normal-case MMF links of less than 300 m, in comparison with the most sophisticated BPL algorithm, the simplest PL algorithm is sufficiently effective in escalating the OOFDM MMF system performance to its maximum potential. The effectiveness of the PL algorithm can be further improved when a large number of subcarriers are utilized. On the other hand, for relatively long MMF links (> 800 m) with their 3-dB bandwidths being much less than the transmitted OOFDM signal spectrum, the BPL algorithm has to be adopted.

"In this paper, temperature-compensated refractive-index (RI) sensing is realized by use of a single Bragg grating inscribed in a silica microfiber. The microfiber is tapered from a single-mode fiber with two short transition regions. The mode evolution and intermodal couplings are analyzed based on the coupled local-mode theory. Due to the sharp variation of transverse geometry along the fiber length, couplings between copropagating local modes are excited, and the energy of light can be distributed into different modes by the transition regions. The grating couples the incident light to phase-matched backward fundamental and higher-order modes at the individual wavelengths. The coupled higher-order modes can be partially retrieved as a result of the abrupt taper. As a result, several reflection peaks can be observed in the reflection spectrum. The peaks present different responses to surrounding RI and identical temperature sensitivity. Therefore, the temperature cross-sensitivity can be removed by measuring the wavelength separations.

"In this paper, we present an electrically controllable microoptical component for light beam steering and light intensity distribution built on the combination of nematic liquid crystal (LC) and polymer microprisms. Polymer microprism arrays are fabricated using soft embossing with elastic polydimethylsiloxane molds and ultraviolet curable resins. Surface profiling measurements show that the dimensions of the replicated prisms closely approximate those of the master prism. Two different LC alignment techniques were employed: hybrid rubbing alignment and obliquely evaporated SiO 2 alignment, both of which result in proper alignment of the LC molecules along the prism groove direction. The operation voltage of the LC components is relatively low (10 Vrms). The steering angle of a green laser beam was experimentally studied as a function of applied voltage, and a steering range of 3° was found. The active LC components also effectively deflect a collimated white light beam over a steering angle of about 2° with an efficiency of 27%-33%.

The large enhancement is due to high Purcell factor and high collection efficiency of modified L3 cavity verified by far-field patterns.

"Resonant micro-optic gyros (RMOGs) with waveguide-type ring resonators are promising candidates for applications demanding small, light, and robust gyros. However, the nonzero bias at the gyro output fluctuates in terms of both the bias and the bias stability, owing to the temperature variations of the waveguide-type resonator. In particular, the temperature sensitivity of the bias stability varies greatly depending on the temperature. This paper intends to reveal that these observed fluctuations arise from the temperature-dependent polarization fluctuation. We will investigate how such polarization fluctuation affects the bias of the gyro-output through the state of polarization of the input beam, the polarization characteristics of the resonator coupler, and the temperature variation of the resonator. Both our numerical simulation and experimental verification are carried out, which, for the first time to our best knowledge, demonstrate that the long-term stability of the RMOG can be significantly improved by optimizing the temperature of the waveguide resonator.","['Silicon compounds', 'Thermal stability', 'Resonant frequency', 'Optical waveguides', 'Stability analysis', 'Optical resonators', 'Integrated optics', 'Gyroscopes']","['Integrated optics', 'optical resonators', 'gyroscopes']"

"Nanophotonic structures enabling the engineering of linear dispersion are often exploited for nonlinear processing. However, the dispersion of the nonlinear response has been generally overlooked, also because of the difficulty of accurately taking this effect into account. Here, we first show the necessity of considering the nonlinear dispersion and then propose a simplified approach through which the modeling can be performed. As an example, we consider waveguides in which a large group index and low group velocity dispersion are achieved at the same time by modifying a single design parameter, i.e., an asymmetric translation of the hole rows closest to the core. It is shown that the dependence on the wavelength of the normalized Bloch mode overlap integrals for self-phase modulation (SPM) can be interpolated by a four-parameter formula that is similar to the Morse potential. The parameters can be related to specific properties of the nonlinear SPM coefficient, which in the specific case depends on the translation parameter, by simple linear and exponential functions. Cross-phase modulation and four-wave mixing coefficients can then be derived from the self-phase one, through a geometric mean, slightly corrected to account for the interacting wave detuning, and the complete modeling of nonlinear dispersion is achieved.","['Dispersion', 'Modulation', 'Indexes', 'Optical waveguides', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Mathematical model']","['Four-wave mixing', 'photonic crystals', 'Kerr effect', 'nonlinear integrated optics', 'nonlinear effects in nanostructures', 'photonic materials and engineered photonic structures', 'slow light']"

"Operation frequency is discussed for near-infrared photodiodes (PDs) using Ge layers on Si, which are indispensable for the photonic-electronic convergence on an Si chip. Based on the formula derived from the continuity equation, Ge pin PDs on Si are found to operate with the 3-dB cut-off frequency as high as 80 GHz, which is limited by the slow diffusion current from the n and p layers. In order to increase the frequency, a new structure is examined, which is composed of a p-Ge/i-Si/n-Si heterojunction. In this structure, electrons generated in the p layer of Ge are collected by the i layer of wider gap Si, being similar to uni-traveling-carrier PDs of InGaAs/InP in III-V systems.

"Numerical models play an important role in the design of the optical fiber drawing process for tailored mechanical properties and optical transmission characteristics. The rigorous part of a numerical fiber drawing model is the determination of the neck-down profile, which is calculated based on a force balance along the fiber axis, requiring intensive numerical iterations for solution. An alternative approach has been the use of an empirical neck-down profile based on experimental results; however, this approach is restricted to the simulation of the particular drawing conditions used in the experiments. This paper presents an approach to numerical simulations of an optical fiber drawing process where an analytical hyperbolic tangent function is used to describe the neck-down shape in a generalized manner, and the parameters of the function are determined based on a force balance for the drawing conditions. The physical model is based on a 2-D numerical analysis of the flow, heat, and mass transfer phenomena involved in the drawing and cooling processes during the manufacturing of optical glass fibers. The effects of fiber draw speed, maximum furnace temperature, and the furnace length on the neck-down profile are investigated and discussed in terms of the final fiber radius and the draw tension.

"A system involving W-band (75-110 GHz) optical millimeter (mm)-wave generation using the external optical modulator (EOM) in a radio-over-fiber (RoF) link is presented for satisfying the requirements for multi-gigabit-per-second data rates. A 90-GHz mm-wave signal was generated by a nonupling (nine times) increase in only a 10-GHz local oscillator by biasing the EOM at its zero level and choosing an appropriate modulation index. To achieve a fast transmission speed wirelessly, high spectral efficiency (SE), and better transmission performance, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is used. The bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM) of the system were measured for three different fiber lengths and for a wireless distance of 1-5 m.

"In this paper, we propose a hybrid multidimensional coded-modulation (CM) scheme based on a new multidimensional signal constellation design as a solution to limited bandwidth and high energy consumption of information infrastructure. This multidimensional signal constellation, herewith called vector-quantization-based signal constellation design (VQ-SCD), is based on the vector quantization theory. The proposed scheme employs both the electrical basis functions (in the form of the prolate spheroidal wave functions) and the optical basis functions (in the form of polarization and spatial mode states) as optical basis functions. The proposed coded VQ-SCD scheme is the enabling technology for optical serial transport with bit rates exceeding 1000 Tb/s (1 Pb/s). In addition, the CM scheme we proposed allows for the adaptive, elastic, and dynamic allocation of the bandwidth. This fine granularity bandwidth manipulation is envisioned as a part of future software-defined optical networking.","['Constellation diagram', 'Optical polarization', 'Vectors', 'Probability density function', 'Optical fiber networks', 'Optical signal processing', 'Algorithm design and analysis']","['Microwave photonics signal processing', 'optical Ethernet', 'advanced FEC', 'LDPC coding', 'coded modulation', 'multidimensional signaling', 'elastic optical networks']"

The proposed comb filter consists of a rotatable polarizer, a PBS, and a 3-dB fiber coupler. By adjusting the polarization state of the lasing light launched into the PBS, the multiwavelength switchable operation can be easily achieved. When the proposed comb filter was incorporated into the laser cavity, up to 11 multiwavelength switchable lasing lines with a channel spacing of 1.2 nm were obtained.

"We propose and experimentally demonstrate a dynamic encryption method to realize physical layer security for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing passive optical network (OFDM-PON). In our scheme, encryption of the downstream signal is obtained by applying exclusive or (xor) operation between optical network units' (ONUs') downstream signals and received upstream signals at the optical line terminal side. The upstream signals are used as secure keys for corresponding ONUs. Then the encrypted downstream signals are sent to the ONU sides, where the downstream signal can be retrieved by applying xor operation again between the encrypted downstream signal and the stored upstream signal. Since each ONU cannot obtain the upstream signals of other ONUs, only the ONU itself can recover its downstream signal from the encrypted downstream signal. Moreover, the secure key is dynamically changing along with the upstream signal, significantly improving the security of the downstream signal for the OFDM-PON system. A 5-Gb/s 16-quadrature amplitude modulation OFDM signal with xor-based encryption has been successfully implemented over a 25-km standard single-mode fiber.

"Recirculating frequency shifting (RFS) has attracted much attention for its advantages in flexible and high-quality optical frequency comb (OFC) generation. As the number of tones increases, the phase coherence of the tones plays a very important role in the stability of the generated OFC. It is found in this paper that by controlling the phase coherence of the tones, the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the generated OFC will decrease sharply. This will effectively relieve the distortion caused by fiber nonlinearity, which will enable the loop to support more tones under the condition of constant output power. Based on the phase coherence control method, a 100-tone OFC with 10-GHz frequency spacing and a single RFS loop is successfully realized.","['Frequency modulation', 'Peak to average power ratio', 'Frequency control', 'Coherence', 'Radio frequency', 'Amplitude modulation']","['recirculating frequency shifting (RFS)', 'optical frequency comb (OFC)', 'phase coherence control']"

This spontaneous Rayleigh seed may be stronger than the quantum background and may affect the mode instability thresholds of fiber amplifiers. This new seed estimate can be incorporated in STRS models to improve threshold calculations.","['Rayleigh scattering', 'Noise', 'Optical refraction', 'Optical scattering', 'Optical variables control', 'Refractive index']","['Fiber lasers', 'laser amplifiers', 'fiber non-linear optics', 'scattering', 'theory', 'modeling']"

"We propose a novel approach for the generation of flat optical frequency comb (OFC) using a single polarization modulator (PolM) and a Brillouin-assisted power equalizer (BAPE). The reference radio-frequency (RF) signal applied to the PolM is provided by an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO). The spectra of the optical signals launched to the BAPE are optimized in advance for the generation of OFCs with different number of lines. The BAPE is introduced to flatten the uneven OFC lines by attenuating the optical lines having power beyond the threshold of the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and amplifying the ones having power below the SBS threshold with the amplifier inside the BAPE. In addition, the OFC generator is optical wavelength independent since there is no optical filter involved in our approach. We experimentally demonstrated that the proposed OFC generator can produce 5, 7, 9, and 11 lines within a spectral flatness of 0.5, 1.5, 2, and 4.1 dB, respectively.","['Optical attenuators', 'Optical variables measurement', 'Gain', 'Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers', 'Radio frequency', 'Scattering']","['Optical frequency comb', 'stimulated Brillouin scattering', 'polarization modulation']"

"In this paper, we propose a coded orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based heterogeneous transparent optical networking scenario. The OAM is associated with the azimuthal phase dependence of the complex electric field. Because OAM eigenstates are orthogonal, they can be used as basis functions for multidimensional signal constellations. From Shannon's theory, we know that information capacity is a linear function of a number of dimensions and a logarithmic function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, through multidimensional signal constellations, we can dramatically improve the overall aggregate data rate per single wavelength. The ability to generate the OAM modes, such as Bessel and Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, in both multimode fibers (MMFs) and free-space optical (FSO) links will allow the realization of heterogeneous transparent FSO-fiber-optics communication networks, composed of MMF and FSO links, with ultrahigh bits-per-photon efficiencies. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed heterogeneous optical networking scenario. We demonstrate the high potential of the proposed network to solve high-bandwidth demands and interoperability problems simultaneously. Finally, we prove that a dramatic improvement in spectral efficiency is possible by employing this OAM-based multidimensional signaling scheme.","['Optical fiber networks', 'Optical fibers', 'Modulation', 'Parity check codes', 'Nonlinear optics']","['Orbital angular momentum (OAM) modulation', 'heterogeneous free-space optical multimode fiber (FSO-MMF) optical networking', 'low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes', 'coded-modulation']"

At very low index contrast, the resolution worsens dramatically, particularly for Δn <; 0.01, where we observe a resolution exceeding 10 μm for our device.

"The wavelength tunability of all-normal-dispersion (ANDi) ytterbium (Yb)-doped mode-locked fiber laser is experimentally investigated, where the laser is mode-locked by nonlinear polarization rotation and the wavelength is adjusted by an intracavity tunable filter. The influences of pump power, gain fiber length, and cavity length (i.e., repetition rate) on the mode-locking wavelength and output spectrum are investigated. It is found that the tunable range of mode-locking wavelength depends on the length of the Yb-doped fiber, as well as the cavity loss, and is independent of the cavity length. Mode-locking in a longer wavelength regime can be obtained by increasing the gain fiber length, although the length depends on the cavity loss. Moreover, the effects of pump power, central wavelength, Yb-doped fiber length, and cavity length on other output parameters are discussed. The variation range of pump power to keep the mode-locking status is also analyzed.

"A nanoplasmonic loop-stub structure is proposed. Its fundamental properties are studied and compared with those of single-stub and double-stub structures of similar structural parameters. The results show that loop-stub structure has two sets of resonances. One set is similar to the resonances of single-stub and double-stub structures; these resonances are tunable by varying the widths of vertical branches. In contrast, other sets of resonances, which are unique to this structure, can be independently controlled by varying the width of the horizontal branch. The advantage of the loop-stub design over conventional stubs is that it can support traveling-wave-like modes in addition of the standing-wave modes. This feature offers a potential to realize directional add/drop filters for either forward or backward dropping. Moreover, it can provide efficient coupling between waveguides of different widths.","['Optical waveguides', 'Periodic structures', 'Optical filters', 'Band pass filters', 'Filtering theory', 'Resonator filters', 'Couplings']","['Plasmonics', 'waveguide devices', 'nanocavities', 'modeling']"

"In this paper, we present a new adaptive image registration nonuniformity correction method with the function of eliminating ghost artifacts. This method assumes that the irradiation of objects stays unchanged during the adjacent two frames' time interval and then corrects the corresponding pixels of two frames by the result of image registration. With regard to real-time continuous image sequence, we first calculate the displacement vectors based on their row and column projections. Then, by bidirectional image registration, we can get the overlapped area matrices of two frames accurately. Meanwhile, a variance threshold is set to judge the scene classification, and then, displacement revising is selectively added to decrease stripe noise. Considering that moving targets exist, the error function for updating is also accordingly adapted to eliminate the ghost artifacts. By using the least-mean-square-error iteration algorithm, the gain and offset coefficients of the overlapped area can be updated in real time with the image sequence adaptively. The advantages of this algorithm lie in its high efficiency of image processing, low computational complexity, and few ghost artifacts.

It is shown that such cascaded strippers can overcome the challenging problems of localized heating and thermal degradation of the recoating materials, which are limiting factors for the conventional high power cladding light strippers. The power-handling capability of the device is tested up to cladding light of power up to 150 W. A high attenuation of 18 dB has been achieved, whereas the maximum local temperature is less than 64 ° C. We anticipate that this simple configuration offers a practical solution for cladding light extracting in high power fiber lasers and amplifiers.","['Plastics', 'Refractive index', 'Optical fiber devices', 'Optical fiber amplifiers', 'Attenuation', 'Diode lasers', 'Fiber lasers']","['Cladding light stripper', 'double-cladding fiber', 'fiber lasers and amplifiers']"

"InGaN/GaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a graded-composition multiple quantum well (GQW) were designed not only to investigate the effect of polarization field on the efficiency droop in InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) but to find out possible solutions to prevent or reduce the efficiency droop in GaN-based LEDs as well. Pulsed electroluminescence measurement, to avoid heating effects partly, revealed that the output intensity peak occurs at∼280 A/cm2current density for the GQW structure, whereas for a conventional structure, it occurs at a much lower current density of∼150 A/cm2. The relative quantum efficiency indicates that the efficiency droop in GQW LEDs was reduced effectively due to the reduction in polarization field in the active layer. In the test GQW structure with inverse indium composition variation direction, electrons escape from the active region, which is in company with rapid saturation of output power and decrease in efficiency observed at high current density. It indicates that at high current density, the electron leakage is obvious. These results suggest that the polarization field in the active layer and the consequent electron leakage are probably the main mechanism responsible for the efficiency droop at high current injection levels.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Gallium nitride', 'Quantum well devices', 'Current density', 'Indium', 'Power generation', 'Charge carrier processes']","['Metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)', 'InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW)', 'electron leakage', 'efficiency droop']"

"We explain modal processes in 2-D guided-mode resonance reflectors with subwavelength periods in terms of the mode structure of quasi-equivalent 1-D grating-based reflectors. The 1-D gratings are designed via a second-order effective-medium theory. The principal features in the reflection spectra of the 2-D devices show good quantitative agreement with the corresponding 1-D grating spectra for small modulation strength. Thereby, clear connections are established with the TE and TM modal states of a reflector. For reflectors made with silicon that has a high index of refraction, there is qualitative agreement between the 2-D spectra and the concomitant 1-D modal signatures. Two-dimensional reflectors with periodic rods and holes are treated. In both cases, it is found that the spectra are dominated by contributions from a single polarization state in the 1-D grating equivalent. The results and methods provided herein enable improved understanding of the physical properties of 2-D resonant reflectors and the related 2-D modulated devices, including photonic crystal slabs. Hence, this methodology facilitates the design of 2-D reflectors in general as is straightforwardly applied to device architectures, materials, and spectral regions beyond those treated here.","['Gratings', 'Reflectivity', 'Reflection', 'Modulation', 'Electric fields', 'Refractive index', 'Optical waveguides']","['Engineered photonic nanostructures', 'diffractive optics', 'subwavelength structures', 'nanophotonics', 'guided-mode resonance', 'effective-medium theory']"

"We propose a scheme that can attain the same transmission bit rate as the corresponding conventional polarization-division-multiplexed (PDM) quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) scheme while occupying lower bandwidth and, hence, achieving a higher spectral efficiency. In contrast to the conventional approach, which increases the symbol rate and thus the occupied bandwidth to transmit the redundant symbols due to forward error correction (FEC), the proposed approach expands the underlying signal constellation in size and reduces the FEC code rate accordingly to form a mechanism that can achieve coded transmission without bandwidth expansion. Such a scheme can find applications in scenarios where there exist stringent bandwidth restrictions and bandwidth expansion is not considered as a viable option. Although the idea of constellation expansion in lieu of bandwidth expansion is mainly associated with Ungerboeck's trellis-coded modulation (TCM), our proposed nonbinary low-density parity-check (LDPC)-coded modulation scheme shows that block-coded modulation schemes can also be used with expanded constellations to achieve transmission without bandwidth expansion and without resorting to TCM. Our results reveal that for small to medium constellation sizes, the proposed scheme can preserve bandwidth while not experiencing significant increase in required optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). For large constellation sizes, however, to keep the increase in required OSNR at manageable levels, we propose using controlled bandwidth expansion where constellation expansion and bandwidth expansion are used simultaneously to obtain a balance between the two critical system parameters of bandwidth and required OSNR.","['Bandwidth', 'Parity check codes', 'Forward error correction', 'Modulation', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Optical noise', 'Encoding']","['Coherent communication', 'coded modulation', 'fiber optics communication', 'forward error correction (FEC)', 'low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes']"

The proposed design’s downlink performance is analyzed, taking into account many challenging issues, including beam spreading loss, cloud attenuation, statistical behaviors of the atmospheric turbulence in the dual-hop channel, and pointing misalignment due to the UAV hovering. Different performance metrics are analytically derived based on channel modelings, including outage probability, average transmission rate, and achievable spectrum efficiency. In addition, the average system BER, which satisfies the design constraint, is also numerically obtained.

"This paper reports the outcomes of the tests that we conducted as online measurements for the evaluation of one optical fiber long-period grating produced by a fusion technique in a single-mode radiation-hardened optical fiber, and subjected to gamma irradiation. During the irradiation, the grating temperature was monitored. Before the irradiation, the temperature sensitivity of the grating was 27.7 pm/°C, while the value of this parameter postirradiation was found to be 29.3 pm/°C. The spectral characteristics of the grating were measured (i) in the laboratory with an ANDO AQ6317C optical spectrum analyzer and (ii) online, for the first time, with a LUNA OBR 4600 backscatter reflectometer, operating in the frequency acquisition mode. Such online measurement enables the study of recovery effects during the irradiation. The wavelength dip of the grating shifted under gamma irradiation, with 16 pm/kGy for the maximum total dose of 45 kGy. At room temperature, the recovery of the irradiation-induced shift of the wavelength dip was almost complete in about 120 h, at a rate of 6.7 pm/h. Postirradiation heating of the sensor produced the reversing of the recovery effect.

"Graphene-based metamaterials are gaining popularity for developing various reconfigurable and electrically tunable optical devices – especially in terahertz (THz) and infrared (IR) bands. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to investigate the broadband metamaterial-based absorber that efficiently absorbs the THz radiation ranging from 2.2 to 4.6 THz. The proposed absorber comprises a simple meta-square ring of graphene, which possesses different slots in its structure to induce multiple plasmonic resonances. It is observed that the proposed absorber manifests above 95% absorption for the normally incident THz waves, and it also maintains its absorption value over 80% for different obliquely incident operating conditions. Furthermore, the proposed absorber shows polarization-insensitive features. In addition, the absorption characteristics regulate from 95% to 15% by adjusting the chemical potential of graphene from 1 eV to 0.1 eV. Some of the salient features of the proposed absorber is largest reported bandwidth for single layer absorber with smallest footprint without sacrificing polarization insensitivity or amplitude tunability. From the application point of view, it could provide the pathway for implementing switching, cloaking, smart absorbers, and detection phenomena in the THz range.","['Graphene', 'Absorption', 'Metamaterials', 'Resonant frequency', 'Broadband communication', 'Wideband', 'Optical sensors']","['Terhertz', 'broadband', 'polarization-insensitive metamaterial', 'absorber', 'graphene', 'tunable']"

"Coding metasurfaces incorporated with reconfigurable elements can dynamically control electromagnetic waves to realize reconfigurable multiple functionalities. The mostly existing active devices usually work in microwave band and have little ability to dynamically control terahertz waves. Here, a graphene-based coding metasurface (GBCM) is presented to realize dynamic beam steering for terahertz waves. The coding state “1” of the proposed GBCM can be continuously tuned to “0” by Fermi level of an integral graphene film. In order to verify the working principle, two examples are designed to demonstrate the dynamic tunability of the proposed GBCM for terahertz waves. One is dynamic multi-beam switching and another is dynamic diffusion switching. Under the normal illumination of terahertz waves, a 1D periodic-sequence GBCM produces dual-, tri- and single-beam by setting Fermi level as 0.05 eV, 0.15 eV and 0.70 eV, respectively. Similarly, a 2D periodic-sequence GBCM produces quad-, penta- and single-beam by setting Fermi level as 0.05 eV, 0.11 eV and 0.70 eV, respectively. In the case of aperiodic coding sequence, reflected waves can be dynamically switched from diffusion to mirror reflection by increasing Fermi level from 0.05 eV to 0.70 eV. The above functionalities are well verified by theoretical calculations and numerical simulations.","['Encoding', 'Metasurfaces', 'Graphene', 'Reflection', 'Conductivity', 'Switches', 'Metamaterials']","['Beam steering', 'coding metasurface', 'graphene', 'terahertz']"

When the temporal waveform was simulated using the Fourier components, the oscillating behavior due to the efficient DFG of the two cavity modes was clearly observed after the initial ultrafast response near the incident surface. Assuming the exponential decay of signal sensitivity in the high-frequency region, the simulated results were consistent with the experimentally measured ones for coupled cavity structures grown on (113)B GaAs substrates.","['Cavity resonators', 'Gallium arsenide', 'Nonhomogeneous media', 'Electric fields', 'Ultrafast optics', 'Surface waves', 'Substrates']","['Terahertz generation', 'optical microcavity', 'III-V semiconductors', 'frequency mixing', 'femtosecond laser']"

"We achieved optically pumped lasing actions of extremely small optical resonators, which have 1.4-2-μm-diameter GaN hexagonal nanorings with wall widths of 60-140 nm. The hexagonal nanorings were grown by rf-plasma molecular beam epitaxy (rf-MBE) with Ti-mask selective area growth (SAG). Due to the nanometer scale of the wall width, the propagation of threading dislocations through the wall was suppressed, and high crystalline quality of the nanoring resonators was achieved. The hexagonal nanorings possessed a fine cavity configuration of crystallographically flat outer walls and consisted of hexagonally connected sixfold side sections. The periodic boundary condition for each section with a short length limits the number of longitudinal resonance wavelengths, and narrowing the wall suppresses the occurrence of lasing in higher transverse modes. Therefore, both contribute to the lasing action in a single longitudinal mode of the hexagonal nanoring.","['Nanostructured materials', 'Cavity resonators', 'Optical resonators', 'Optical waveguides', 'Optical device fabrication', 'Optical variables control', 'Optical surface waves']","['Nanostructures', 'photonic materials', 'semiconductors', 'solid-state lasers']"

"Microwave frequency downconversion is optically implemented by using two cascaded polarization modulators (PolMs), characterized by full-frequency-range coverage and high conversion efficiency. In this proposed approach, the incident radio-frequency signal (RF) and the local oscillator signal (LO) are applied to the first PolM at the transmitter and the second one at the receiver, respectively. Effective optical carrier suppression can be achieved using the cascaded PolMs, whereas the optical sidebands induced by the RF and the LO signals remain unchanged. Since no additional optical filter is needed, the lower operation frequency limit in other approaches with an optical filter is eliminated, such that a full-frequency-range coverage is ensured in this approach. Meanwhile, the use of optical carrier suppression (OCS) enables high conversion efficiency for microwave downconversion. In the proof-of-concept experiments, the conversion efficiency is improved by over 20 dB within the frequency range from 2 to 15 GHz, as compared to those of cascaded modulators without OCS.

"A high-spectral-efficiency photonic frequency down-conversion approach for wavelength-division-multiplexing radio-over-fiber (WDM-ROF) uplinks is proposed and experimentally investigated. In the approach, an optical frequency comb serves as the carriers of multiple channels, and each comb line is modulated by the upstream radio-frequency (RF) signal via single-sideband modulation. At the central station, the beating between the sideband with upstream signal and its adjacent optical carrier leads to photonic frequency down-conversion without additional optical frequency shifts. Due to the band overlapping or the reduction of guard band between adjacent channels, a high spectral efficiency is achieved for WDM-ROF uplinks. A two-channel experimental uplink is established, where a 15-GHz RF signal carrying quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) data is successfully down-converted to a 2-GHz intermediate frequency (IF) signal. For the 10-Mb/s QPSK data, the measured eye diagrams and the constellation diagrams clearly show the effectiveness of the frequency down-conversion and the influence of the transmission distance.

"We design an ytterbium-doped large pitch photonic quasi-crystal fiber (PQF) for amplifying high-energy ultrashort laser pulses. The proposed fiber exhibits unique properties such as very large mode area (4660 μm 2 ), less attenuation (0.42 dB/km), high overlapping factor (0.55 for the fundamental mode), and low bending loss. These properties help amplify with high-average power ultrashort pulses with less distortion and high efficiency. To meet these requirements, we design a fiber with optimum gain filtering as well as loss filtering.

"We present systematic predictions for light enhancement in optical nanowires with nanoscale air holes in the core through numerical modeling. We show that the light intensity within such holes is strongly dependent on the hole size and refractive index of the host material and that light enhancement becomes significant only when the hole size is less than a critical value: 70 nm for silica and F2 nanowires and 50 nm for a As 2 S 3 nanowire. High index As 2 S 3 nanowires exhibit nearly eight times higher average mode intensity than silica glass for hole sizes of less than 10 nm.

"We report the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-enabled mechanically tunable negative-index photonic crystal lens, which was comprised of 2-D photonic crystal and symmetrical electro-thermal actuators. The 2-D photonic crystal was made of a honeycomb lattice of silicon rods embedded in an SU-8 membrane. A silicon input waveguide and deflection block were also fabricated for light in-coupling and monitoring of focused spot size, respectively. When actuated, the electro-thermal actuators stretched the photonic crystal and consequently modified the photonic band structure. This, in turn, modified the focal length of the photonic crystal lens. The fabricated device was fully characterized using a tunable laser and an infrared camera while being actuated with a constant current source. The intensity and lateral spot size observed at the deflection block gradually increased as the applied current increased from 0 to 0.3 A.

"We have developed the expressions for terminal currents in transistor lasers (TLs) having a single quantum well (SQW) as well as multiple quantum wells (MQWs) of different well and barrier widths in the base by solving a continuity equation relating the bulk carrier density with the 2-D carrier density via virtual states (VS). The gain in the quantum well (QW) is obtained by considering strain, 2-D density-of-states, polarization-dependent momentum matrix element, Fermi statistics, and Lorentzian broadening. A calculated value of 7.06 mA of threshold base current for three 16-nm-wide QWs in the base indicates a substantial reduction from the calculated and experimental value of 21.5 mA for a 16-nm-wide InGaAs QW in GaAs base. A similar reduction is also obtained for three QWs of different widths having variable barrier widths. The estimated modulation bandwidths (BWs) are higher in the case of MQW structures than in the SQW TL. Above threshold, the effective base recombination time, including spontaneous and stimulated processes, gives rise to a fast recombination process in the base, which leads to resonance-free modulation response.

"A noise reduction method of Fresnel computer-generated hologram (CGH) using wavelet transform and smooth filter is presented. Noise in hologram is very difficult to remove because an interference pattern is recorded on a digital camera during the digital processing. It also occurs in the reconstruction process, which is affected by discrete quantizing levels and optical experiment setup. So, we develop an algorithm that is capable of changing pixel values at different scales with imaginary or real value according to the requirements of each position in the hologram. A new algorithm is proposed to satisfy the above requirements using a mathematical transformation between the smooth filter function and mother wavelet function in a wavelet transform. In this paper, a theoretical model to predict the effect of noise is described and verified by the experimental results. Based on this, the resultant noises in the reconstructed image by Fresnel CGH algorithm are decreased clearly when spatial light modulator (SLM) for 3D object is placed at distance from 260 mm to 900 mm.

"We experimentally investigate and characterize the improvement in thresholding capability of a compact highly Ge-doped nonlinear interferometer-based all-optical thresholder using optical offset spectral filtering.

Although the nonlinear interferometer-based thresholder has been useful for signal regeneration and thresholding, it has several limitations, including severe pulse distortion due to pulse bifurcation at high input powers and a fixed power transfer function.

By tuning the central wavelength of the passband optical filter, a single-passband MPF with a frequency tuning range from 5 to 35 GHz is obtained. The 3-dB bandwidth and the out-of-band suppression ratio are measured to be 4 GHz and 20 dB, respectively. In addition, the tunability of the MPF that is dependent on the driven current of the DFB-SOA is also experimentally investigated.","['Optical filters', 'Passband', 'Optical amplifiers', 'Optical fibers', 'Stimulated emission', 'Optical modulation']","['Radio frequency photonics', 'Laser amplifiers', 'Frequency filtering']"

"A novel optical frequency-hopping scheme in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) systems is proposed to achieve secure communications with high capacity. Frequency hopping is realized by the hopping of digital signals among different channels. In the proposed system, the signal from any source is separated into small segments in the time domain, and the segments are carried by more than one different-wavelength optical carrier. All the optical waves in the proposed WDM system are modulated by signals from two or more sources at different times. The signal from a certain source is also interference to signals from other sources. Hopping, synchronization, de-hopping, and routing are all digitally implemented in field-programmable gate array chips. The system is reconfigurable by software to adapt to different rates.

On the other hand, by taking advantage of the photon–photon resonance, the laser has high modulation efficiency around the beating frequency that is far beyond the intrinsic modulation bandwidth of the lasers. It eliminates the use of high-speed external modulators and dramatically reduces the threshold gain of the oscillator.

"The inherent data-erasing functionality of a 10-Gb/s colorless Fabry-Pérot laser diode (FPLD) wavelength controlled by reusing a downstream optical carrier with encoded data is explored. By operating the injection-locked colorless FPLD at high dc bias, the unique in situ data-erasing mechanism is attributed to the almost identical power-to-current slope, regardless of optical injection-locking level. When reusing the downstream carrier, the injection-locked upstream colorless FPLD can significantly suppress the extinction ratio of the residual 10-Gb/s downstream data from 7.1 to <; 1 dB. This facilitates direct reuse of the downstream carrier without the need for an additional data eraser.

Even with a downstream injection power value of only -9 dBm, the upstream bit error rate (BER) of such a dual functional colorless FPLD biased at ≥2I th indicates a BER of <; 1 × 10 -10 .

"In recent years, visible light positioning (VLP) systems have attracted considerable attention because they do not require additional infrastructures. However, most existing researches on the VLP ignore the impact of wall diffuse reflection, which can lead to the dramatical decrease of the position accuracy performance near the indoor walls and corners. In this paper, we design an indoor VLP system with one single light-emitting diode (LED) and a rotatable photodetector (PD), and then propose an indoor VLP algorithm based on machine learning (ML) methods with concern for the indoor reflection of the optical propagation. The proposed positioning process is implemented via two stages: area classification and positioning. During the area classification stage, by using the random forest (RF) algorithm, the entire room is divided into one interior area and four wall or corner zones. In the interior area, the rotatable PD is directly used to determine the target location. In the four wall or corner zones, a hybrid positioning algorithm based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is developed to improve localization accuracy near the indoor walls and corners. Simulation results show that by using the proposed indoor VLP system with the rotatable PD and the hybrid algorithm, the maximum and averaged positioning errors of wall or corner zones drop from 137.96 cm and 15.63 cm, to 38.34 cm and 1.43 cm, respectively, and the averaged positioning error of the whole room decreases from 11.97 cm to 1.74 cm.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Radio frequency', 'Visible light communication', 'Machine learning algorithms', 'Interference', 'Detectors', 'Clustering algorithms']","['Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)', 'extreme learning machine (ELM)', 'Internet of things (IoT)', 'random forest (RF)', 'rotatable PD', 'single LED', 'visible light positioning (VLP)']"

The switching mechanism is discussed by analyzing the electric field and power loss distributions, as well as the impedance matching principle. Moreover, the buffering capability and the absorption performance both remain noticeable within a wide range of the incidence angle. This work offers a strategy for the function-switching metamaterial which provides potential applications in terahertz detecting, switching and slow light devices.","['Metamaterials', 'Optical switches', 'Strips', 'Optical buffering', 'Insulators', 'Absorption', 'Vanadium']","['Switchable metamaterial', 'vanadium dioxide', 'buffering', 'absorbing']"

"We report on a simple approach of time-delayed reservoir computing (RC) based on a two-element phased laser array for image identification. Here the phased laser array with optical feedback and injection is trained according to the representative characteristics extracted through histograms of oriented gradients.

By optimizing the parameters of the RC, we achieve an identification accuracy of 97.44% on the MNIST dataset and 85.46% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. These results indicate that our proposed RC indeed allows accurate classification of handwritten digit and fashion production.

"Yellow electroluminescence (EL) of a 20-pair Si-rich SiN x /SiO x superlattice is demonstrated by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and annealing process. After annealing at 900 ° C for 30 min, two photoluminescence (PL) peaks at 480 and 570 nm are observed to blue-shift the PL wavelength, and the corresponding peak intensity is enhanced due to the self-aggregation of Si quantum dots (QDs). When increasing the annealing temperature to 1050 ° C , the PL peaks caused by the aggregated Si-QDs in SiN x and SiO x layers red-shift to 500 and 600 nm, thereby shifting the PL peak wavelength to 520 nm.

"This paper proposes the use of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) for the deflection monitoring of a micromegas (MM) tracking particle detector to be installed at the European Organization for Nuclear Research during a major upgrade of the experiment ATLAS within 2018. MM detectors are designed to reach high spatial and time resolution, even if the design is not yet finalized. One mandatory issue for the MM detector is a precise monitoring of the deflection of the drift and read-out electrodes and/or of the panel hosting the electrodes. To this aim, FBG strain sensors are proposed and experimentally investigated as a sensing solution to monitor the strain state of the detector support panel hosting the drift and read-out electrodes. Finally, simple postprocessing analysis based on classical beam theory considering a rigid body permits calculating the panel deflection.

"An electron-beam-fabricated subwavelength grating coupler for direct side coupling of light emission from a high-power laser diode array (LDA) was studied theoretically and implemented experimentally. A gold-embedded silica-based design for grating coupler was employed to minimize the thermal expansion caused by the accumulated heat from light absorption by metal part of the grating coupler. In addition, with the consideration of the backward diffraction loss and the groove wall nonverticality caused by fabrication distortion, the grating pitch and groove width were optimized for the highest coupling efficiency. According to the experimental results, the grating coupler is capable of coupling light power up to 21 W from a 976-nm continuous-wave-operated LDA into the inner clad of a 400-μm-diameter double-clad fiber with an overall coupling efficiency of 50%. Furthermore, an LDA side-pumped ytterbium-doped DCF laser by using the grating coupler was demonstrated. By fine tuning the slow-axis collimation lens array, the laser-pumping scheme can easily be switched between bidirectional pumping and unidirectional pumping. Compared with the unidirectionally pumped fiber laser of the same gain fiber length, the laser slope efficiency of the bidirectionally pumped fiber laser was increased by 18% because of a better gain distribution over the fiber length. Finally, the signal output power of 10 W with a slope efficiency of 61% was achieved for the bidirectional side-pumped fiber laser.","['Gratings', 'Optical fiber couplers', 'Couplers', 'Diffraction', 'Laser excitation', 'Diffraction gratings', 'Fiber lasers']","['Diode-pumped lasers', 'gratings', 'diffractive optics']"

A hanging stick, which is dipped into a liquid tank, is directly mounted on the other end of the rotatable lever. The buoyancy will increase as the stick depth of immersion into the liquid increases. The tension the MZI subjected will increase according to the proportion of L 1 /L 2 on account of the lever principle.

"An optical distribution network (ODN) sharing scheme to integrate mobile backhaul networks with the existing passive optical network (PON) systems is proposed and demonstrated. With the ODN sharing scheme, the expense of building new fibers for the next-generation fifth-generation (5G) mobile backhaul networks can be reduced. As many wavelengths are allocated to the already deployed PON systems, there remain limited wavelengths for the mobile backhaul systems. Hence, to efficiently increase the serving cell sites of the 5G systems, spectral-efficient orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is adopted in the mobile backhaul systems. In order to reduce the latency of the system, adaptive adjustment of the OFDM signals for different transmission distances is averted. The OFDM signals are transmitted only using specific available bandwidth. The available bandwidth for each wavelength is studied according to the power fading relationship between the transmission distances and the chirp induced from signal modulation. A proof-of-concept demonstration experiment has been performed. In our results, 20.17 Gb/s with a bit error rate (BER) lower than3.8×10−3was realized with a split ratio of 256 and a 40-km transmission distance of the PON ODN.

"The advantages of blue InGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with thickness-chirped barriers in the active region have been investigated by using the Crosslight APSYS programs. The results show that the output power of the proposed LED is increased 80% and the efficiency droop is decreased from 59% in conventional LED to 28% at the current of 250 mA. Based on the analysis of electrical and optical characteristics, these improvements are mainly attributed to the change of electrostatic field in the active region by using thickness-chirped barriers. In the even-numbered barriers, the fields are increased, which gets rid of more seriously bended valence band and results in decreased barrier heights for hole transport in the active region. Furthermore, the direction of electrostatic field in the last barrier is reversed to along the drift direction of holes, which not only can lead to upbended conduction band to rise the barrier height for electron escape but also can accelerate holes to increase the hole injection current. As a result, electrons blocking and holes injection are enhanced, and in turn, the performance of the proposed LED is improved.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Charge carrier processes', 'Gallium nitride', 'Radiative recombination', 'Electrostatics', 'Aluminum gallium nitride']","['InGaN light-emitting diode (LED)', 'thickness-chirped barriers', 'efficiency droop', 'Crosslight']"

"A fiber optic vibration sensor using a fiber Bragg grating Fabry-Pérot interferometer with a wavelength-swept laser diode source, which works well for the case of small strain-amplitude vibration, exhibits inaccuracies in the interrogation caused by the nonlinearity of the wavelength modulation in the source when the strain amplitude due to vibration is large. With increasing the frequency of the wavelength sweep, the span of the wavelength sweep is reduced and the nonlinearity is pronounced. We experimentally characterize the nonlinearity, and by using a fiber Fabry-Pérot interferometer as a wavelength reference, we compensate it to enhance the accuracy of the interrogation for large strain-amplitude vibration. The proposed sensor achieves vibration measurement with a strain resolution of 0.3 nε/√{Hz} , measurement time of 10 μs, and maximum measurable value of 34 με at the wavelength-sweep frequency of 100 kHz under the present condition. The measurement time is limited by the capability of the laser diode driver, and the maximum measurable strain would be easily enhanced by increasing the wavelength-modulation current amplitude.","['Modulation', 'Fiber gratings', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical interferometry', 'Wavelength measurement', 'Strain']","['Fiber Bragg grating', 'optical fiber sensor', 'strain sensor', 'Fabry–Pérot interferometer']"

"Light-induced photoluminescence (PL) switching using azobenzene-doped liquid crystal (LC)-dispersed quantum dots (QDs) is demonstrated in a format of LC cell and LC-infiltrated tube. Before light irradiation, excitation photons undergo multiple scattering events before emission out of the LC cell, and PL intensity is high. Upon the light irradiation, the trans-to-cis photoisomerization of azobenzene makes the QD-dispersed LCs highly transparent, thus allowing most excitation photons to pass through LCs and decrease PL intensity. This demonstration may allow a new modulating technique for future development of light-switchable, QD-emission-based display or photonic devices.","['Radiation effects', 'Photonics', 'Optical imaging', 'Optical switches', 'Electron tubes', 'Optical scattering', 'Optical filters']","['Photonic materials', 'optical properties of photonic materials']"

"This work presents a new low-cost and environmentally friendly optical transducer based on surface scattering in a side-polished fiber mounted on a glass groove. The surface roughness caused by polishing is used to estimate the change in refractive index on top of the fiber. Changing the surrounding index affects the scattering properties and, consequently, the leakage of the guided mode. This effect is experimentally investigated through the change in the attenuation coefficient when the surrounding refractive index is changed by dropping different weight ratios of glucose solutions onto the polished side. The measured change of the attenuation coefficient is consistent with the finite-element calculations. The effect of different polished depths was theoretically investigated to optimize the working conditions.","['Optical fiber sensors', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Scattering', 'Optical surface waves']","['Fiber optics sensors', 'Nondestructive testing', 'Scattering measurements']"

"The effective plasma frequency in a photonic crystal (PC) is defined as the lowest frequency at which electromagnetic wave can start to propagate through the PC. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the effective plasma frequency fp , eff for a magnetized 1-D plasma PC (PPC). The PPC is made of two constituents, i.e., the plasma and the dielectric material like quartz. The effective plasma frequency in a PPC is obtained based on the calculated photonic band structure (PBS). It is found that fp , eff can be controlled by the externally applied static magnetic field, namely, fp , eff decreases significantly as the static magnetic field increases. This suggests that the plasma layer in a PPC shows a dielectric-like behavior when the magnetic field is applied. In addition, in the presence of static magnetic field, fp , eff will be increased as a function of electron density and thickness of the plasma layer. In the angular dependence of effective plasma frequency, we find that fp , eff is a decreasing function of angle of incidence in the absence of the static magnetic field. However, it becomes an increasing function of angle of incidence when the static magnetic field is applied. Finally, the effect of filling factor of the plasma layer is also illustrated.","['Plasmas', 'Magnetic fields', 'Photonic crystals', 'Permittivity', 'Dielectrics', 'Mathematical model', 'Photonics']","['Effective plasma frequency', 'plasma photonic crystal (PPC)', 'transfer matrix method (TMM)']"

"We present a method for improving the spatial resolution and the amplitude by an optimized deskew filter in long-range optical frequency-domain reflectometry (OFDR). In a previous deskew-filter method, as the nonlinear phase estimated from an auxiliary interferometer is used to compensate for the nonlinearity effect in the beating signals generated from a main OFDR interferometer, the spatial resolution and amplitude of the reflection peak in a long range (i.e, 80 km) are deteriorated by a residual nonlinearity effect due to the estimation inaccuracy of the nonlinear phase. In the proposed optimized deskew-filter method, the estimation accuracy of the nonlinear phase is improved by the higher orders of Taylor expansion and the high accuracy of the estimation of the time delay in the auxiliary interferometer using a cepstrum. We experimentally demonstrate that the amplitude of a reflection peak at 80 km increases by 20.5 dB and that the spatial resolution is up to 80 cm, which is about 187 times enhancement when compared with that of the same OFDR trace without nonlinearity compensation.","['Spatial resolution', 'Estimation', 'Taylor series', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Optical fiber filters', 'Optical fiber couplers', 'Optical interferometry']","['Tunable lasers', 'scattering', 'heterodyning', 'fiber optics systems']"

"A multiwavelength Brillouin-erbium fiber laser (MBEFL) temperature sensor with high and tunable sensitivity has been developed and experimentally demonstrated in this paper.

"When used for object tracking, the discriminative correlation filter (DCF) is effective, but its performance is often burdened by undesirable boundary effects. Meanwhile, when there is too much background information in training samples of the DCF, it will be easier to learn the area deviating from the tracking object. Further, illumination variation, partial/full occlusion, and appearance variations, render the response map aberrance of the correlation filter (CF) more prone to occur. To overcome these problems, an object tracking model based on a time-varying Spatio-temporal regularized correlation filter with aberrance repression is proposed in this paper. Firstly, by adding a regularized term to the traditional CFs to limit the change rate of the response map generated in the object detection phase, the proposed tracker can obviously repress the aberrance of the response maps; secondly, by adjusting the filter to the object regions suitable for tracking with high confidence scores with a time-varying spatial reliability map, the proposed tracker effectively overcomes the adverse effects caused by the boundary effect; and finally, by introducing a temporal regularized term, the proposed tracker also has superior tracking ability for the partial occluded objects and those with large appearance variations. Significant experiments on the OTB100, VOT2016, TC128, and UAV 123 datasets have revealed that the performance thereof outperformed many state-of-the-art trackers based on DCF and deep-based frameworks in terms of tracking accuracy, tracking success rate, and A-R rank, etc.","['Correlation', 'Object tracking', 'Feature extraction', 'Visualization', 'Training', 'Adaptation models', 'Information filters']","['Visual tracking', 'correlation filter', 'spatial reliability map', 'temporal regularized', 'aberrance repression']"

"Computing the permittivity and permeability of complex materials has previously relied on a series of simplifying assumptions to enable analysis. The most restricting requirement is that the optical axes of the material must align with the laboratory frame of reference. This requirement cannot be met for a large group of materials, including crystalline structures and metamaterials such as tilted nanorods. Currently, designing the optical characteristics of these structures would require ellipsometric analysis, which uses an error-correction-based technique. Here, a new technique built upon the underlying physics of ellipsometry is proposed to extract arbitrary permittivity and permeability tensors using a set of off-axis measurements. This new permittivity and permeability tensor extraction technique allows all 18 elements of the permittivity and permeability tensors to be nonzero and extracts them, given a set of reflectance and transmittance measurements. Several materials are analyzed here, including a) an isotopic plane of known permittivity, b) an anisotropic aligned structure, and c) a tilted-nanorod-based sample that cannot be measured using traditional methodologies. The isotropic plane shows very low error (<; 10 -4 %) in the x and y tensor measurements and around 1% error in the z tensor measurement at higher (metallic) permittivities. The aligned structure's characteristics are compared to measurements made with traditional techniques and show excellent agreement between the techniques. The tilted nanorod characteristics are analyzed and used to predict the reflection and transmission coefficients at other angles. The predictions compare very well with the computational electromagnetic simulations, showing at most 5% error over the range examined.","['Permittivity', 'Erbium', 'Permeability', 'Ellipsometry', 'Tensile stress', 'Metamaterials', 'Permittivity measurement']","['Electromagnetic metamaterials', 'computational electromagnetics', 'metamaterials']"

"The transmission resonance characteristics of a gold double-layered compound grating (DCG) are investigated numerically using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) method. The DCG is assumed to comprise two identical single-layered gratings separated by an air gap with a thickness of 0 ~ 250 mm. Furthermore, each grating is assumed to comprise two slits with different widths (w) within each period. The physical origins of the transmission features of the DCG structures are examined using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The RCWA results show that the optical transmission spectra of the considered DCG structures can be tailored over a wide range of wavelengths via a suitable adjustment of the air gap thickness. Moreover, it is shown that, for values of the air gap thickness greater than 100 nm, the transmission spectrum of the DCG structure converges toward that of a single-layered compound grating (SCG). Overall, the results presented in this paper show that the optical transmission properties of a metallic DCG are highly sensitive to the thickness of the air gap between the two grating structures. As such, DCG structures are ideally suited to the realization of proximity sensors and other photonic-based optical devices.","['Gratings', 'Gold', 'Compounds', 'Optical sensors', 'Finite difference methods', 'Photonics']","['Diffraction gratings', 'transmission', 'sensors']"

"Carbon nanotubes possess appealing properties for terahertz (THz) applications. This work investigates the contribution of these properties in the context of THz photoconductive (PC) switches as THz detectors. The analysis engages the received THz electric field, the optical excitation, and the photocarrier dynamics of the carbon nanotube material through Drude-Smith theory and equivalent circuit model. Through this analysis, the effect of each parameter in the detected current can be investigated. Based on a realistic numerical assessment and comparison with our measurements for a conventional LT-GaAs PC switch, it is found that improvement in detected current is theoretically achievable, depending on the relative value of the imaginary photoconductivity of the CNT film. This is a parameter that can be varied through chemical treatment of the film. We found that, unlike the case of PC switches as THz emitting devices where a higher mobility is desired for higher output THz power, the detected current in the THz receiving PC switch is a nonmonotonic function of the mobility in the single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) film. The capabilities and limitations revealed in this study set guidelines for fabrication and optimization of more efficient carbon nanotube-based THz receiving PC switches.

Its saturable absorption parameters could be deliberately tailored by thinning its thickness by mechanical exfoliation. The incorporation of the as-fabricated saturable absorber inside the fiber laser cavity allows for the operation of either a microsecond or a femtosecond pulse because different saturable absorption parameters can decide whether the fiber laser operates in the mode-locking or Q-switching state.

"Free-space optics (FSO) is attracting renewed attention in the frame of 5G, which demands wireless backhauling technologies with extremely high data rates over distances up to a few kilometers. Link availability is a FSO well-known issue due to the large path loss expected during poor visibility, such as in case of fog. Several path loss models, based on the visibility, are assessed through an analytical approach. The simple relationship valid in the visible spectrum can be extended to the first optical window, while, at 1.550 μm, the effect of fog microphysics cannot be ignored. Fog is definitively less challenging in the mid-IR (10.6 µm) even at very low visibility values (less than 0.5 km), which was not evident from older studies. Lower and upper bounds for the extinction coefficient are calculated and substituted into the FSO link budget equation. The combined effect of the microphysics and of the accuracy of visibility measurements may result in large uncertainties on the maximum achievable path length. The latter is also influenced by the microclimate, as links are usually deployed in urban areas while visibility data are collected outside. Path lengths in city areas can double, for the same link availability.","['Atmospheric measurements', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical scattering', 'Optical attenuators', 'Atmospheric modeling', 'Attenuation', 'Uncertainty']","['Optical communication', 'free-space optics', 'visibility', 'fog', 'attenuation', 'extinction coefficient', 'mid-IR', 'near-IR', 'path loss']"

"A high-brightness GaN-based vertical light-emitting diode (VLED) was demonstrated by introducing a large-area low-cost direct printing process. A hexagonally close-packed micrometer convex array was fabricated on the n-GaN top layer of the VLED by direct printing using a hydrogen silsesquioxane solution and subsequent inductively coupled plasma etching. To confirm that the enhancement of light extraction by this structure, a conventional wet-chemical-etched structure was also fabricated on the n-GaN top layer of the VLED, yielding randomly oriented pyramid structures on the layer. Both VLEDs showed much stronger electroluminescence emission than an unpatterned VLED. However, the micrometer convex array improved the light extraction significantly more than the random pyramid structure owing to its greater ability to enlarge the light escape cone, attributed to its 50°-tapered profile and large extraction area. After chip packaging with silicone encapsulation, the light output power of the micropatterned VLED was 11.4% and 106% greater than those of the wet-etched and unpatterned VLEDs, respectively, under a 350-mA drive current.","['Arrays', 'Printing', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Etching', 'Gallium nitride', 'Iterative closest point algorithm']","['Light-emitting diodes (LEDs)', 'microstructure fabrication']"

"In this paper, high-order silicon/air vertical 1-D photonic crystals (PhCs) featuring a deep reflectivity notch (Q of about 3000) within the third telecommunication transmission window are fabricated by electrochemical micromachining of silicon and optically characterized. Although, from scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigations, the microfabricated structures appear to be of high quality in terms of in-plane and out-of-plane uniformity as well as of low surface roughness, optical measurements highlight variability of the spectral position of reflectivity notches, which turns out to be affected by fine variations of structural features induced by fabrication. A nondestructive optical method is used to recover the distribution of typical fabrication features, which is not easily quantifiable with other techniques in these high aspect-ratio vertical structures, from the experimentally detected distribution of the optical features. Optical distribution is obtained by scanning the device with high spatial resolution and recording spectral reflectivity at normal incidence (in the wavelength range 1.0-1.7 μm) on different locations of the 1-D PhC surface (X-Y plane). Distribution of silicon thickness variation on the X-Y plane is then inferred by best fitting the experimental spectral reflectivity data with theoretical spectra that are calculated by taking into account nonidealities of both PhC structure and measuring setup. On-sample fabrication-induced variation of the average silicon thickness, as a function of the X-Y position, is estimated to be limited to ±80 nm (percentage error of ±1%) within a range of ±100 μm from a reference location. As a consequence of such thickness variation, a maximum shift of the reflectivity spectrum of 40 nm occurs as a function of the X-Y position in the range of ±100 μm. Sample-to-sample average silicon thickness variation among nominally equivalent structures is also tested in similar X-Y positions and found to be lower than ±1.5% (absolute variation of ±120 nm), within a range of ±15 μm, with respect to the average value on the investigated samples.","['Reflectivity', 'Silicon', 'Optical reflection', 'Optical device fabrication', 'Optical fibers', 'Etching']","['Micro and nano opto-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS)', 'modeling', 'optical properties of photonic materials', 'photonic materials', 'synthesis and fabrication methods']"

"This paper presents a secrecy performance analysis of a parallel free-space optical/millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communication system with a selection-combining receiver over a unified Fisher-Snedecor \mathcal{F} -distribution channel. The \mathcal{F} -distribution model, with the proper parameters, may be used to describe both the mm-wave and optical channels. The security performance is specifically evaluated by deriving closed-form expressions for the average secrecy capacity, secrecy outage probability, and strictly positive secrecy capacity. We examine the three following distinct security scenarios: 1) An FSO-link eavesdropping attack, 2) mm-wave-link eavesdropping attacks, and 3) eavesdropping attacks on FSO and mm-wave links at the same time. Furthermore, to better understand the influence of various system and channel parameters, asymptotic analysis is performed at high signal-to-noise ratio values. Our developed analytical expressions provide an efficient tool for examining the influence of various system and channel parameters on the secrecy performance, including the atmospheric turbulence severity, pointing errors of the FSO link, fading severity, the shadowing parameters, as well as the number of diversity branches of the mm-wave links.

"Solid-state nanopores are structures that can be fabricated using the electron beam of a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Nanopores can be used to electrically detect individual DNA molecules, and they have the potential to be applied to genomic sequencing. Current nanofabrication methods are manual and time-consuming, and thus, they do not allow for the fabrication of large-scale nanopore arrays. One of the requirements in the development of an efficient fabrication process is the automated recognition and measurement of nanopore dimension in real time. Here, we present a method for nanopore edge detection that uses Shannon entropy to identify nanopores in electron microscopy images.

"A first-order Lyot-type fiber comb filter was fabricated by incorporating a polarization-diversity loop structure composed of a polarization beam splitter, two half-wave plates (HWPs), and two polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF) segments. One of the two PMF segments was two times longer than the other, and they were concatenated with a 60 ^{\circ} offset between their principal axes. The transmission spectra and output polarization characteristics of the filter were theoretically predicted and experimentally verified. By proper control of the two HWPs, first-order transmission spectra could be obtained, including flat-top and lossy flat-top band modes, and the interleaving operation of the respective spectrum could be also achieved. This flat-top band mode spectrum showed a higher attenuation rate at the cutoff level, in comparison with that of the Solc-type filter. In particular, it was revealed that the output state of polarization of the filter was a periodical function of wavelength and that the evolution period was different, according to transmission band modes. With the help of a linear output polarizer, the specific portion of a passband could be passed or rejected by controlling input polarization. It was also theoretically predicted that the fine tuning of the passband center was possible within a specific wavelength range.","['Optical fiber filters', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Optical fiber couplers', 'Propagation losses', 'Information filters']","['Fiber comb filter', 'Lyot filter', 'birefringence', 'polarization-diversity loop', 'polarization-maintaining fiber']"
"Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely studied and adopted in visible-light communication (VLC) systems because of its high spectral efficiency and low-complexity implementation. However, OFDM-based VLC systems suffer from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), along with the nonlinear transfer characteristics of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In this paper, a subcarrier grouping scheme for an OFDM-based VLC system is proposed. This scheme exploits the property that one LED lamp usually contains multiple independent LED chips. In the proposed scheme, all OFDM signal subcarriers are divided into groups, and each group is transmitted by an individual LED chip while the same receiver structure is maintained. The PAPR is reduced significantly because only some of the subcarriers are located on each LED chip. Hence, the achievable input power can be increased, leading to a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a lower bit error rate (BER). Simulated and experimental results demonstrate that the BER performance can be improved by over two orders of magnitude. Moreover, an adaptive switching mechanism is also proposed in this paper, in which a subcarrier grouping scheme is employed adaptively when the required input power is high. Simulation results validate that the proposed mechanism can enhance system robustness significantly.","['Peak to average power ratio', 'Optical transmitters', 'LED lamps', 'Noise', 'Wireless communication']","['Visible light communication', 'orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing', 'multi-chip LED']"

To do so, we derive the secrecy outage probability and the probability of positive secrecy capacity performance for mixed RF-FSO relaying schemes under RF and FSO eavesdropper attacks, respectively. To justify the problem, we consider two general fading models, Nakagami- m at the RF side and exponentiated Weibull distribution at the FSO side.

The results indicated that MPM can accurately exhibit whether colorectal carcinoma invades into the submucosa or the muscularis propria. Collagen content alteration and the presence of dirty necrosis can be extracted to serve as quantitatively intrinsic biomarkers for reflecting collagen degradation, the occurrence of desmoplastic reaction, and breakdown of cancer cells, which are tightly related to the prognosis of colorectal carcinoma. With the development and clinical applications of the multiphoton endoscope, in vivo histological-like diagnosis of tumor invasion depth may become its main application in the field of colorectal carcinoma and lead to faster and improved therapeutic decision making in the clinics.","['Cancer', 'Tumors', 'Microscopy', 'Muscles', 'Medical diagnostic imaging', 'Pathology']","['multiphoton microscopy', 'invasion depth of colorectal carcinoma', 'submucosa', 'muscularis propria']"

A proposal for an all-optical memory based on a bistability of single-mode states in a dual-mode diode laser with time-delayed optical feedback is presented. The system is modeled using a multimode extension of the Lang-Kobayashi equations with injected optical pulses. We uncover the bifurcation structure by deriving analytical expressions for the boundaries of the bistable region and demonstrate how the delay time in the external cavity determines an optimal pulse duration for efficient switching of the memory element. We also show the relevant role played by gain saturation and by the dual-mode solutions of the Lang-Kobayashi equations for the existence of the bistable regions. Our results demonstrate that feedback-induced bistability can lead to significant performance improvements when compared to memory elements based on the injection locking bistability in dual-mode devices.,"['Bifurcation', 'Cavity resonators', 'Electronic countermeasures', 'Mathematical model', 'Optical feedback', 'Optical pulses']","['Dual-mode diode lasers', 'all-optical memory', 'external optical feedback', 'bistability', 'Lambert function']"

"We report a broadband 1× N microwave photonic splitter (MPS) with arbitrary amplitude ratio and phase shift. The key devices used in the MPS are a polarization modulator (PolM), an optical bandpass filter (OBPF), polarization controllers (PCs), and polarizers (Pols). The cascaded PolM and OBPF generate an orthogonally polarized single-sideband modulated optical signal. The phase difference between the two orthogonal components and the state of polarization of the optical signal can be adjusted by the PC independently. After the polarization-to-intensity modulation conversion by the Pol, the microwave is recovered in the PD. The amplitude and phase of the microwave signal can be independently tuned by adjusting the three plates of the PC. The proposed MPS is theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified. Broadband MPS with bandwidth from 8 to 40 GHz is successfully achieved. In addition, we apply the proposed MPS to a two-tap microwave photonic filter (MPF). The notch position and depth of the MPF are tunable by adjusting the phase shift and amplitude ratio between the two optical branches, respectively.","['Microwave filters', 'Optical polarization', 'Microwave photonics', 'Microwave amplifiers', 'Optical filters', 'Optical modulation']","['Microwave photonic splitter', 'polarization modulation']"

"In this paper, turn-on time delay characteristics of a fiber grating Fabry-Perot (FGFP) laser are numerically investigated by considering all the carrier recombination rate (CRR) R(N) coefficients (nonradiative, A nr ; radiative, B; and Auger coefficient, C). The results show that the turn-on time delay significantly reduces by increasing the injection current (I inj ) and/or the initial value of carrier density (N i ). Meanwhile, the turn-on time delay increases by increasing the CRR coefficients. However, its effect can be minimized by increasing I inj and/or N i . In addition, the turn-on time delay can be reduced by increasing the external optical feedback (OFB) level. Moreover, it is shown that the optimum external-cavity length (L ext ) is 3.1 cm. Furthermore, an antireflection (AR) coating reflectivity value of 1 × 10 -2 is sufficient for the laser to operate at good turn-on time delay and low fabrication complexity.

"A temperature-insensitive fiber-optic displacement sensing scheme by cascading the fiber up taper and Bragg grating is experimentally demonstrated. The strength-robust up taper, which is fabricated by excessively splicing the Bragg grating to the interrogation fiber, functions as the bridge between the core mode and the cladding modes. This cascading structure realizes the cladding-mode backward recoupling, and displacement information can be directly read out by measuring the power of the highly bending sensitive recoupled cladding modes. Two sensing configurations that respectively utilize the normal fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and the uniform chirped FBG (CFBG) for the cladding-mode backward recoupling have been studied contrastively, in which the tunability of the up taper is fully validated to support a better dynamic range of the measurement. Aiming to improve the low reflection power and enhance the sensing sensitivity, the CFBG is used, and the reflection power is increased by more than 200 times and reaches 176 μW, which lowers the precision requirement for the optical power meter and potentially reduces the cost of the sensing system.","['Fiber gratings', 'Couplings', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Temperature sensors', 'Gratings']","['Fiber up taper', 'fiber Bragg grating', 'displacement sensor', 'temperature-independent']"

"Unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-based communications are expected to play an important role in the future generation wireless communication networks. It is a promising solution to enhance the wireless connectivity of devices without infrastructure. As compared to the terrestrial communications, UAVs offer various advantages such as line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity, dynamic deployment and flexible reconfiguration. Further, free space optics (FSO) communication is considered as a possible solution to enable UAV-based communication links due to its cost effective and high bandwidth nature. However, despite offering large bandwidth, UAV-based FSO links are marred by atmospheric path loss, atmospheric turbulence, non-zero boresight pointing errors, and angle-of-arrival (AoA) fluctuations. In this paper, the performance of a hovering UAV-based FSO communication system is investigated. The closed-form expressions for outage probability, average symbol error rate (SER), and ergodic capacity are derived taking into account both heterodyne (HD) and direct detection (DD) techniques for ground-to-UAV (G2U), UAV-to-UAV (U2U), and UAV-to-ground (U2G) links over the generalized Málaga distribution.

"This paper proposes a new receiver based on frequency-domain diversity combining (FDDC) for an asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) system. Compared with its time-domain diversity combining (TDDC) counterpart, the FDDC receiver is capable of more effectively exploiting the frequency selectivity of the channel to further improve the detection performance, which is proved by postcombining signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) analysis. An enhanced version of the FDDC receiver, which is called eFDDC, is also proposed subsequently. It allows for optimal selection among multiple sets of candidate symbol vectors based on signum matrix estimation.

"Graphene, which is a single layer of carbon atoms assembled in a honeycomb lattice, has recently attracted significant attention, primarily due to its extraordinary electronic properties. In fact, its photonic properties are not less exciting. Graphene interacts with light strongly from ultraviolet to far infrared, and such interaction is tunable by electric field. Moreover, although graphene itself is gapless, a direct, tunable bandgap can be created by breaking its intrinsic crystallographic symmetry. These unique properties make graphene a promising candidate for various light detection, manipulation, and generation applications in an ultra-wide operational wavelength range. In this paper, we first discuss a few possible photonic applications based on the exceptional photonic properties of graphene, followed by detailed presentation on graphene photodetectors.

For a 10-Gb/s NRZ-PSK signal, we show that when the residual dispersion in the optical signal exceeds 425 ps/nm, further increases in dispersion have little effect on the photocurrent. Thus, this TPA-based OSNR monitor can be used in practical systems with large dispersion.","['Optical noise', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Optical waveguides', 'Photoconductivity', 'Silicon', 'Monitoring']","['Two-photon absorption (TPA)', 'silicon photonics', 'optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) monitoring']"

"Free-space optical (FSO) links are contemplated as a potential paradigm to yield efficient point-to-point communication in wireless systems. Notably, these links are used to provide the proficient wireless connectivity between the radio frequency (RF) wireless network and the fiber optic-based network. To this end, more attention has been paid to mixed FSO-RF systems where single-hop FSO transmission and single-hop RF transmission configuration is used. In this paper, we propose a mixed FSO-RF dual-hop simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) relaying system in the presence of power amplifier (PA). It is assumed that FSO links suffer from Málaga (M)-turbulence with pointing errors and RF links experience the double shadowed Rician fading. Particularly, the physical layer security is analyzed by deriving the closed-form expressions for secrecy metrics such as secure outage probability, strictly positive secrecy capacity, and secrecy throughput. We consider the three scenarios: 1) FSO-side eavesdropping attack 2) RF-side eavesdropping attack 3) Simultaneous FSO- and RF-side eavesdropping attacks. The asymptotic approximations for the final results are also derived to obtain secrecy diversity order. The effect of SWIPT parameters and PA efficiency on the secrecy performance are then further investigated in detail. In summary, the results show that the reliability and security of the proposed system can be enhanced by utilizing efficient PAs at the RF front end depending on the eavesdropper's location and can also be controlled by the SWIPT parameters.","['Radio frequency', 'Eavesdropping', 'Wireless communication', 'Hardware', 'Security', 'Rician channels', 'Receivers']","['Double shadowed Rician (DSR) fading', 'physical layer security (PLS)', 'Málaga (M)-turbulence', 'mixed FSO-RF systems', 'power amplifier (PA)', 'secrecy outage probability (SOP)', 'strictly positive secrecy capacity (SPSC)', 'secrecy throughput (ST)']"

For the first measurement, both the transmission response of an optical device-under-test (ODUT) and the measurement error are recorded. For the second measurement, only the measurement error is obtained by suppressing the optical carrier using SBS in the DSF. The accurate transmission response of the ODUT is subsequently extracted by subtracting the error from the first measurement. The proposed method is theoretically investigated and experimentally demonstrated.

"The importance of free-space optical (FSO) communication has increased during the last decade, introducing its unique features such as its high data rate, license-free spectrum, ease of deployability, and low power consumption.

"The single-mode limit and bending losses for shallow rib waveguides are studied using the full vectorial film mode matching method. The maximum rib height for single-mode waveguides is found to be on the order of 10 nm for a rib width of 2 μm and a wavelength of 785 nm, with the exact value depending on the core thickness and the polarization. Bending losses are calculated as a function of several geometrical parameters, for both polarizations and for the fundamental and the first order modes. Bending losses decrease significantly with rib height for single-mode waveguides. For slightly larger rib heights, giving multimode waveguides, it is found that the bending losses for the first-order mode are several orders of magnitude larger than for the fundamental mode. Thus, a small bend can act as an excellent mode filter, making it possible to use higher ribs giving low bending losses for the fundamental mode, while maintaining the waveguide practically single-mode. For TM-polarization, leakage loss can be important and can cause bending losses to increase for larger rib heights (8-80 nm).","['Optical waveguides', 'Optical losses', 'Sensors', 'Propagation losses', 'Sensitivity', 'Refractive index', 'Materials']","['Bending loss', 'Single-mode limit', 'Film mode matching method', 'Integrated optics', 'Rib waveguides']"

"Indirect illumination with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and a diffuse reflector is widely applied in various fields that require uniform illumination, whereas the high uniformity obtained is always at the cost of sacrificing the light efficiency. Hence, in this paper, the energy conservation is implemented to greatly compensate for an inefficient design. A mathematical model of a free-form reflective surface based on the Lambertian characteristic of LED, ideal diffuse surface, and energy conservation is established. The diffuse free-form surface is constructed by solving a series of equations numerically. Furthermore, several array configurations are used to illustrate the advantages of the free-form surface. Finally, not only in the far-field simulation but in the near-field simulation as well, the results show better uniformity and higher efficiency compared with traditional design methods (direct illumination and diffuse illumination with a hemispherical inner surface).","['Lighting', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Mathematical model', 'Energy conservation', 'Reflection', 'Design methodology', 'Reflectivity']","['Optics', 'Advanced optics design']"
"The non-line-of-sight (NLOS) underwater communication can offer a viable route in signal propagation and coverage, thus mitigating the pointing, acquisition, and tracking difficulties in line-of-sight optical communication. However, implementing the NLOS link is non-trivial. While the NLOS technique relies on light scattering, i.e., channel turbulence can facilitate NLOS communication, the associated path-loss (PL) can be significant. Signal fading can degrade link robustness, which arises due to ocean water temperature and salinity fluctuation and gradients. To evaluate the robustness of NLOS in natural waters, we systematically measure the link metrics, such as the bit error ratio, PL, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), of water bodies of uniform and nonuniform vertical salinity ranging from 30–40‰ (part-per-thousand). We found that salinity-induced turbulence can establish NLOS communication with PL reduction of 2.35 dB/m and SNR increase by 32.5 \% for dynamic water. Furthermore, a strong correlation was obtained between the strength of signal fluctuations and the received SNR. Finally, we obtained a Gaussian distribution of the statistical scintillation behavior. These results demonstrated the benefit of using the NLOS regime for underwater wireless sensor networks for aiding designers and engineers.","['Salinity (geophysical)', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Scattering', 'Ocean temperature', 'Optical scattering', 'Optical refraction', 'Optical transmitters']","['Non-line-of-sight', 'turbulence', 'salinity', 'underwater optical communication']"

"A hybrid plasmonic waveguide is considered as one of the most promising architectures for long-range subwavelength guiding. The objective of this paper is to present a theoretical analysis of plasmonic guided modes in a symmetric conductor-gap-dielectric (SCGD) system. It consists of a thin metal conductor symmetrically sandwiched by two-layer dielectrics with low-index nanoscale gaps inside. The SCGD waveguide can support ultra-long range surface plasmon-polariton mode when the thickness of a low-index gap is smaller than a cutoff gap thickness. For relatively high index contrast ratios of the cladding to gap layers, the cutoff gap thickness is only a few nanometers, within which the electric field of the guided SCGD mode is tightly confined. The dispersion equations and approximate analytical expressions of the cutoff gap thickness are derived in order to characterize the properties of the guided mode. Our simulation results show that the cutoff gap thickness can be tailored by the metal film thickness and the indices of the cladding and gap materials. The geometrical scheme for lateral confinement is also presented. Such a structure with unique features of low-loss and strong confinement has applications in the fabrication of active and passive plasmonic devices.","['Indexes', 'Metals', 'Propagation losses', 'Plasmons', 'Films', 'Equations', 'Optical waveguides']","['Surface plasmons', 'integrated optics', 'waveguides', 'guided wave']"

"In this paper, we investigate the utilization of low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and optical hard-limiter in OCDMA communication systems. Since the multiple access interference will impose significant penalty on system performance, using optical hard-limiter is an effective countermeasure to relieve this adverse impact. To further increase the aggregate capacity, the LDPC code is employed as an error correction mechanism that can allow more simultaneous users accommodated in the network. As the aggregate capacity and system complexity are the main considerations in practical system design, both of which are mutually trade off. Utilization of LDPC code and optical hard-limiter can effectively reduce the system complexity to reach the maximum aggregate capacity. Our proposed scheme can accommodate large number of users in the network simultaneously and support the traffic asynchronously with each user. Furthermore, the aggregate capacity can reach above 100 Gbps; therefore, it is the preferable way as the platform for fiber distribution network in some applications.","['Optical fibers', 'Optical pulses', 'Parity check codes', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Adaptive optics', 'High-speed optical techniques']","['OCDMA', 'LDPC code', 'carrier-hopping prime code', 'optical hard-limiter']"

We found that the sensitivity of a refractometer is linearly proportional to the wavelength of the dip/peak in the transmission spectrum that is chosen to measure the refractive index (RI) change. Because the wavelength shift is larger for a dip/peak at a longer wavelength than at a shorter wavelength, a linear spectral chirp will occur in the transmission spectrum when the surrounding RI changes. We also found that the sensitivity significantly increases with the decrease in the diameter of the NCF and is independent of its length.

"We theoretically investigate how to efficiently couple a photonic waveguide to a dielectric-loaded surface plasmon polariton (DLSPP) waveguide when they are based on a common core material. The DLSPP waveguide is tapered and butt coupled to the photonic waveguide. First, we propose the use of a dielectric with a higher refractive index than the dielectrics of previous DLSPP waveguides. The photonic and DLSPP waveguides are designed to reduce the loss and tapering region length of the coupling, and the tapering region is optimized. We achieve the coupling between the photonic and DLSPP waveguides based on a dielectric of refractive index of 1.57 with a coupling loss of 2.3 dB through a 3- \mu\hbox{m} -long coupling region. The coupling loss is further reduced by modifying the DLSPP waveguide into a double-DLSPP ( \hbox{D}^{2}\hbox{LSPP}) waveguide. The \hbox{D}^{2} \hbox{LSPP} waveguide has an additional low-index dielectric between its high-index dielectric and metal layer. Designed appropriately, the \hbox{D}^{2}\hbox{LSPP} waveguide can be coupled to the photonic waveguide with a coupling loss of 1.1 dB through a 4- \mu\hbox{m} -long coupling region. Since the photonic and DLSPP or \hbox{D}^{2}\hbox{LSPP} waveguides investigated in this paper can be simultaneously fabricated, they may constitute an easily realizable hybrid planar lightwave circuit with a relatively low loss.",[],[]

"The conventional double-modulated terahertz differential time-domain spectroscopy (double-modulated THz-DTDS) of liquids requires linear dithering of the sample to rapidly vary the sample thickness in order to produce the required sample and reference signals. Linear dithering, however, imposes a fundamental limitation as it introduces mechanical noise into the system, thereby contributing to measurement uncertainty. In this paper, we address this limitation for the terahertz spectroscopy of liquids by using a fixed dual-thickness sample mounted on a spinning wheel. The concept of spinning the sample allows rapid switching between two fixed sample thicknesses in order to produce sample and reference signals without the introduction of added mechanical noise. We validate this new technique by measuring the dielectric properties of a number of liquids and confirm the results against the Debye relaxation model.","['Spectroscopy', 'Spinning', 'Wheels', 'Optical waveguides', 'Liquid waveguides', 'Photonics', 'Biomedical engineering', 'Time domain analysis', 'Chemical analysis', 'Molecular biophysics']","['T-rays', 'terahertz', 'double-modulated DTDS', 'differential time-domain spectroscopy']"

"Nowadays, a high level of security is required for the transmission of critical information. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems are considered the best option to protect such information. Many studies have shown the efficiency of the QKD optical fiber inspired by M-ary pulse position modulation (MPPM). Free-Space Optical (FSO) links provide an efficient and effective data transmission system. However, cumulative effects of laser beam divergence, misalignment, and turbulence-induced fading on the received irradiance in the FSO link might allow an external eavesdropper located near the authorized receiver to break the transmission under certain conditions. This paper introduces the development of an FSO system based on the MPPM and the BB84 protocol (MPPM-BB84) over the Gamma-Gamma (GG) turbulence channel with pointing errors. Time Binning is implemented using MPPM to increase system security and reduce the quantum bit error rate (QBER). The system security is investigated under photon number splitting attack and excess noise. Closed-form expressions for asymptotic expressions of the average symbol error probability (SER), raw key rate (RKR), and secret key rate (SKR) are introduced. Moreover, the Monte-Carlo simulations are then used to prove the validity of the analytical results. The optimal values for the average photon number per pulse (to achieve the maximum RKR and SKR) for each symbol length can guarantee the stability of the FSO system under different weather conditions. Smaller symbol lengths are more tolerant of detector loss. The proposed system supports linking distances from 1 km to 3 km while keeping the SKR almost constant.","['Photonics', 'Protocols', 'Security', 'Optical transmitters', 'Optical pulses', 'Optical receivers', 'Adaptive optics']","['Quantum key distribution (QKD)', 'M-ary pulse position modulation (MPPM)', 'Gamma-Gamma turbulence', 'BB84 protocol', 'secret key', 'bosonic channel', 'poisson distribution', 'photon number splitting (PNS)']"
"A photonic hydrogen gas sensor is fabricated by etching a subwavelength aperture into an optically thick palladium film deposited on the facet of an optical fiber. Upon adsorption of hydrogen onto the palladium surface, the complex refractive index of the film will change, altering the transmission through the aperture. Due to the plasmonic resonances and enhanced transmission of the C aperture, its response to hydrogen is several times larger than that of a plain film or a nonresonant aperture. Furthermore, the asymmetry of the aperture produces a different hydrogen response for the two polarizations. This leads to different sensitivities to hydrogen.

"Remote phosphor light-emitting diode (LED) modules could offer advantages over intimate white phosphor converted LEDs in terms of phosphor operation temperature, light extraction efficiency, and angular color uniformity. Existing commercial devices show a large variety with respect to the dimensions of the mixing cavity, which raises a question about the optimization of the topology. A simplified simulation model applying a two-wavelength approach and considering the remote phosphor as one virtual surface to which three bidirectional scattering distribution functions are attributed (respectively, describing the blue-blue, blue-yellow, and yellow-yellow interactions) is developed and validated.

"The noise performance of three types of n + /p-well single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) fabricated in a standard 180 nm CMOS technology is studied.

The measurement results of dark count rate and afterpulsing showed that the SPAD_DG had better noise performance compared to the SPAD_NG. This is because the dummy poly gate pushed the shallow trench isolation away from the active region of the SPAD, thus reducing the dark noise generated from the Si-SiO 2 interface. The measurement results also revealed that the noise performance can be further improved by connecting the poly gate to the n + cathode.

"The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the noised single-sideband optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (SSB-OOFDM) signal in a direct-detection OFDM system is first deduced theoretically. The relationship of the carrier-to-sideband ratio (CSR) and guard band (GB) to the signal-to-signal beat interference (SSBI) is explored. According to our theoretical analysis, the degradation caused by SSBI on the SSB-OOFDM signal becomes worse as the GB reduces, whereas the increase in the CSR can loosen this degradation. Therefore, a tradeoff between the GB and CSR balances their joint influence on system performance. The simulation for the 20-km optical link with 40-Gb/s 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) noised SSB-OOFDM signal is conducted to confirm our theoretical results. It shows that, without any complex device or algorithm, the GB can be reduced to 40% only by increasing the CSR to ~8 dB, and thus, the spectral efficiency of the DDO-OFDM link is improved after optimizing the CSR and GB of the SSB-OOFDM signal.

"We propose the reverse concatenated code as a forward error correction (FEC) scheme suitable for beyond 100-Gb/s optical transmission. In this scheme, BCH code is used as inner code and low-density parity-check (LDPC) code as outer code. The BCH decoder is implemented based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding such as the BCJR/Ashikmin's algorithm, and an LDPC decoder is based on a min-sum-with-correction-term algorithm. Because maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding is used as the inner decoder, it provides high accuracy reliabilities to be used in LDPC decoding. We show that proposed FEC scheme performs comparably with much longer LDPC codes of girth 12 for a smaller number of LDPC decoder iterations. Because the outer LDPC code is of medium length and the number of required iterations is low, the proposed concatenated scheme represents an interesting candidate to be used in beyond 100-Gb/s optical transmission. The net coding gain (NCG) of concatenated LDPC(16935,14819)-BCH(64,57) code is 9.62 dB at a bit error rate (BER) of 10 -9 , whereas the expected NCG at BER of 10 -13 is 11.38 dB.

Two slots in the waveguide introduce the dispersion tailoring effect on the quasi-TE mode, which provides more flexibility for designing the waveguide dispersion.

"This study focuses on image sensor communication (ISC), which is a form of visible light communication, using a light-emitting diode (LED) and a camera as the transmitting and receiving device, respectively. In an ISC system, the receiver captures optical signals transmitted by blinking LEDs as an image and demodulates the data using the captured image. The ISC system can spatially separate signals and noises in the image, thus providing superior anti-interference ability. However, because the speed of ISC depends on the shooting speed of the camera, the receiver suffers from a low data transmission rate when a low-speed camera is used. To improve the data rate of ISC, we have developed a rotary LED transmitter. This transmitter cylindrically rotates the blinking LEDs during the exposure time of the camera. The camera captures multiple blinking states of LEDs as afterimages in a single image, thereby increasing the amount of data received per image. In this paper, we propose an ISC system using a rotary LED transmitter and present an experiment for the evaluation of the data rate. The result indicates that the data rate of the rotary LED transmitter is 60 times that of the conventional method.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Cameras', 'Image sensors', 'Optical transmitters', 'Visible light communication', 'Mirrors', 'Radio transmitters']","['Visible light communication', 'image sensor communication', 'optical camera communication', 'rotary LED transmitter', 'afterimage of LED light']"

"Based on a dual-loop optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) with Vernier effect, a scheme of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) interrogation system with an improved scale factor has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Functioning as the optical carrier of the OEO, the reflection signal of two cascaded FBGs is divided into two optical beams by using a wavelength division multiplexer (WDM). The two optical beams at different wavelengths travel along single mode fibers with different lengths. After combined together by another WDM, the two optical beams go through a section of dispersion compensation fiber (DCF). The oscillating frequency shift of the OEO is determined by the overall time delay, which is affected by the wavelength change of the sensing FBG. Thus, the wavelength change of the sensing FBG can be converted into the oscillating frequency shift of the OEO. Furthermore, due to the length difference between the two optical beams, an obvious Vernier effect has been generated in the frequency response of the OEO. By detecting the frequency shift of the envelope peak of the frequency response curve, the sensitivity of the sensing interrogation can be enhanced greatly. A proof-of-concept OEO-based FBG sensor for axial strain sensing experiment is performed. The experimental results show that the sensitivity is about 0.31 KHz/μϵ for a single-loop OEO. By employing Vernier effect, the sensitivity can be improved to -11 KHz/μϵ, which is 35 times higher than that of the single-loop OEO.","['Sensors', 'Fiber gratings', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Strain', 'Optical reflection', 'Optical fiber dispersion', 'Wavelength division multiplexing']","['Bragg gratings', 'microwave oscillators', 'optoelectronic and photonics sensors', 'optical sensors']"

"Visible light communication (VLC) has been recognized as a promising technology for handling the continuously increasing quality of service and connectivity requirements in modern wireless communications, particularly in indoor scenarios. In this context, the present work considers the integration of two distinct modulation schemes, namely spatial modulation (SM) with space time block codes (STBCs), aiming at improving the overall VLC system reliability. Based on this and in order to further enhance the achievable transmission data rate, we integrate quasi-orthogonal STBC (QOSTBC) with SM, since relaxing the orthogonality condition of OSTBC ultimately provides a higher coding rate. Then, we generalize the developed results to any number of active light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and any M -ary pulse amplitude modulation size. Furthermore, we derive a tight and tractable upper bound for the corresponding bit error rate (BER) by considering a simple two-step decoding procedure to detect the indices of the transmitting LEDs and then decode the signal domain symbols. Notably, the obtained results demonstrate that QOSTBC with SM enhances the achievable BER compared to SM with repetition coding (RC-SM). Finally, we compare STBC-SM with both multiple active SM (MASM) and RC-SM in terms of the achievable BER and overall data rate, which further justifies the usefulness of the proposed scheme.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Modulation', 'Complexity theory', 'Indexes', 'Quality of service', 'Encoding', 'Switched mode power supplies']","['MIMO', 'VLC', 'spatial modulation', 'repetition coding', 'SSK', 'STBCs']"

"A heterodyne optical fiber current sensor based on a nanowire-grid (NWG) in-line polarizer is proposed. The NWG is a one-dimension Au grating fabricated on a fiber tip by focused ion beam machining. Because the grating pitch is far smaller than the wavelength of the incident light, it works like an in-line transflective fiber polarizer with both the transmission and reflection light power being measured simultaneously. Based on this unique feature, an all-fiber optical current sensor is demonstrated. The heterodyne measurement makes it withstand light power variations showing good sensing stability. As an all-fiber sensor, discrete and bulky optical components are saved, making it more reliable in practical applications.","['Optical fiber polarization', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Reflection', 'Gratings']","['Fiber optics systems', 'sensors', 'subwavelength structures']"

"The amount of scientific data to be transmitted from deep-space probes is very limited due to radio-frequency (RF) communications constraints. Free-space optical communication can alleviate this bottleneck, increasing data rate while reducing weight, mass, and power of communication onboard equipment. Nevertheless, optimizing the power delivery from the spacecraft to Earth is needed. In RF communications, the strategy has been to increase the aperture of ground terminals. Free-space optical communications can also follow it, as they share the limitation of low power received on Earth. As the cost of big telescopes increases exponentially with aperture, new ideas are required to maximize the aperture-to-cost ratio. This paper explores the feasibility of using the telescopes of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array as optical communication ground stations. Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy has the same power limitation; hence, Cherenkov telescopes are designed to maximize the receiver's aperture with minimum cost and some relaxed requirements. Both the critical issues of the reutilization and possible adaptations of the telescopes to optimize them for communications, as well as telescope simulations and numerical computations of several link budgets applied to worst-case scenarios, are discussed, concluding that the proposal is technically feasible and would bring important cost reductions and performance improvements compared with current designs for deep-space optical ground stations.","['Telescopes', 'Optical imaging', 'Mirrors', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Optical receivers', 'Reflectivity', 'Optical reflection']","['Free-space optical communication', 'Deep-space communication', 'Cherenkov telescopes']"

It is found that the frequency response of the CI-PADC is influenced by both the photonic sampling pulses and the OTDM, of which the combined impact can be characterized through demultiplexed pulse trains. First, the frequency response can be divided into multiple frequency intervals and the range of the frequency interval equals the repetition rate of demultiplexed pulse trains. Second, the analog bandwidth of the CI-PADC is determined by the optical spectral bandwidth of demultiplexed pulse trains which is broadened in the OTDM. Further, the effect of the OTDM is essential for enlarging the analog bandwidth of the CI-PADC employing the photonic sampling pulses with limited optical spectral bandwidth.","['Bandwidth', 'Frequency response', 'Optical pulses', 'High-speed optical techniques', 'Microwave photonics', 'Optical attenuators', 'Optical signal processing']","['Microwave photonics signal processing', 'photonic ADC']"

"We present an investigation of the effect of pumping wavelength on the threshold of transverse mode instability (TMI) in high-power ytterbium-doped fiber laser. By using a fiber laser amplifier with a bi-directional pumping structure, we obtain the TMI thresholds under wavelength-stabilized and non-wavelength-stabilized 976 nm laser diodes (LDs) pumping scheme. The results show that the non-wavelength-stabilized LD pump has a higher TMI threshold compared to the wavelength-stabilized LD pump. By optimizing the operating current of the non-wavelength-stabilized 976 nm LD, a ∼4kW output laser with near single-mode beam quality (M 2 ∼1.3) is achieved, with a slope efficiency of ∼84.4%. The analysis yields that when the pumping wavelength deviates from the 976 nm peak, the TMI threshold can be increased.

"We consider an optical pulse propagating in a tapered photonic crystal fiber (PCF) wherein dispersion as well as nonlinearity varies along the propagation direction. The generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation aptly models the pulse propagation in such a PCF. The design of the tapered PCF is based on the analytical results, which demand that the dispersion decrease exponentially and the nonlinearity increase exponentially. In this paper, we adopt the generalized projection operator method for deriving the pulse-parameter equations of the Lagrangian variation method and the collective variable method. Besides, we consider another pulse profile called raised cosine (RC), which is aimed at replacing the conventional hyperbolic secant pulse. From the detailed results, we infer that the initial RC pulse evolves into a hyperbolic secant pulse.

"Optical channel decorrelation is a key aspect in designing a multi-user visible light communication system. As light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are commonly used for illumination and data transmission in such a system simultaneously, the interference between them is a major problem for suitable modulation schemes. We have proposed to position liquid-crystal (LC) matrix elements in front of the receivers in order to block unwanted light – so effectively acting as filter and reducing the interference. To do so, the appropriate pixels of the LC filter are switched either to a transmissive state or to an opaque state. The selection of the correct pixel patterns is a high-order optimization problem, which makes it challenging for classic algorithms. In this paper, we suggest applying a genetic optimization to find suitable pixel patterns. We combine this kind of receiver-side optimization with conventional convex precoding at the transmitter side in an iterative manner. The overall optimization goal is to maximize the sum rate over all users. To prove the effectiveness, we use a numeric ray-tracing simulation with different settings. Also we analyze the impact of the main parameters for the genetic algorithm.","['Optimization', 'Precoding', 'Receivers', 'Genetics', 'Lighting', 'Reflection', 'Light sources']","['Visible light communication', 'optical communication', 'free-space optical communication', 'multiple-input multiple-output']"

"We report improved light transparency over a broad bandwidth in a metal-layered structure with two film-coupled subwavelength non-close-packed plasmonic arrays. Through the introduction of dual ultrathin dielectric spacing layers between the metal layer and the double plasmonic disk arrays, coupling of the input and output effects of light is efficiently enhanced through strong near-field localized plasmon resonances between adjacent plasmonic disks and the near-field plasmon cavity mode in the gap between the double plasmonic arrays and the metal layer. A broad bandwidth of 300 nm with near-unity light transmittance (above 90%) in the optical regime is achieved through the localized plasmon resonances and the symmetrical structure used here. The transparency of this structure is polarization independent and incident angle insensitive, and can be tuned by varying the structure parameters and the dielectric environment. In addition, the period of the plasmonic arrays and the thickness of the nanometer-separated plasmonic structure are less than λ /20 and λ/8, respectively. These values suggest that the proposed structure may have potential applications in deep subwavelength optoelectronic devices, including broadband optically transparent electrodes, highly integrated light input and output components, and plasmonic filters.","['Plasmons', 'Metals', 'Couplings', 'Optical films', 'Bandwidth', 'Optical polarization']","['Surface plasmon', 'plasmonic array', 'subwavelength metal structure', 'optical transparency', 'hybridization mode']"

"The effects of axial strain on beating frequency from a short cavity polarization-maintaining erbium-doped fiber (PM-EDF) based distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser were investigated theoretically and experimentally for the first time. This type of single-mode DBR fiber laser based ultrasensitive sensor has been extensively developed for measuring kinds of measurands, but the cross-sensitivity of axial strain was usually ignored. A DBR fiber laser with an effective cavity length of \sim1 cm formed by a pair of FBGs written on a PM-EDF was fabricated for demonstration. This laser operated in dual-polarization single-longitudinal mode stably. The frequency of the beating signal generated by two orthogonal polarizations was found to be proportional to the axial strain applied on the cavity. A linear strain sensitivity of 0.640 \hbox{GHz/m}\varepsilonwas obtained, with a fiber birefringence of around 8.65e-5. For the fiber with larger birefringence, the sensitivity to the axial strain will be increased.

"In order to display high-bit resolution images on low-bit resolution displays, bit resolution needs to be reduced. This problem is vital especially for low-cost or small (mobile) devices. To untangle the bit reduction problem, special color quantization algorithms, called dithering, are employed on high-bit resolution images. The dithering process helps to remedy the problem, but it does not help much in terms of storage and transmission of images. To reduce storage needs and lower data transmission, numerous special compression techniques have been proposed in the last several decades. While the well-known compression algorithms, such as gzip, help lower image file sizes, usually, they are not adequate. To improve the compression gain, special compression techniques that take into account structure of image data must be developed. In this paper, we show that, when the pseudo-distance technique (PDT) is used for dithered images, it yields better compression results than GIF and PNG.","['Image coding', 'Image color analysis', 'Indexes', 'Quantization (signal)', 'Optical losses', 'Color', 'Decoding']","['Color palette', 'lossless image compression', 'dithering', 'pseudo-distance metric', 'GIF', 'PNG']"
"The experimental detail of a random lasing action from dye-doped nematic liquid crystals (LCs) inside single-core capillaries with a core diameter below 50 μm was investigated. The resonant characteristics, including the number of emission spikes, the full width at half maximum (FWHM), and the estimated Q-factor, were shown to depend on the core diameter of a capillary. In contrast with a capillary with a larger core diameter and having various emission spikes, only three emission spikes were excited from a capillary with a 10-μm core diameter, owing to the smaller effective area of the pump beam. However, the decrease in the amplitude of emission spikes and the broadening of the linewidth accompanying the higher lasing threshold from a capillary with a 50-μm core diameter are attributed to the decrease in the pump fluence and the increase in the scattering loss, respectively. In this paper, a random laser (RL) with the shortest FWHM emission peak of about 0.47 nm and the highest Q-factor of about 1268 was generated from the capillary with a 20-μm core diameter. By means of temperature adjustment, the emission spectra of the RL that is related to the birefringence and alignment ordering of the LC molecules inside a capillary with a 20-μm core diameter can be effectively altered. Our experiments show that the RL, revealing adjustable output emission spectra, can be a promising device in using remote sensing applications.","['Laser excitation', 'Laser beams', 'Liquid crystals', 'Q-factor', 'Light scattering']","['Random lasing', 'dye-doped liquid crystals', 'single core capillary', 'recurrent multiple light scattering']"

"Numerical modeling of multiorder cascaded fluoride glass Raman fiber laser (RFL) employing fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) is presented. Calculations were compared with the recently reported results, and good agreement was achieved. The model was also used to optimize a fourth-order fluoride glass RFL pumped at 1.9 , which can generate a mid-infrared emission up to 3.36. The influences of launched pump power, fiber length, output coupling, fiber background loss, and insertion loss of FBG on laser performance were investigated. The fiber length of 53.1-85.5 m and reflectivity of output coupler of 0.34-0.51 were recommended to obtain a relative large output power.

Simulated results show that there are three resonant peaks with extinction ratio above 18 dB in the wavelength from 1630 nm to 1720 nm, and the temperature can be measured by calculating wavelength shift of resonant peaks. The experimental results show that the temperature sensitivity of the proposed sensor is as high as 38.6 pm/°C when the temperature ranges from 20°C to 80°C. Meanwhile, the strain sensitivity of the proposed sensor is as low as −0.457 pm/μϵ when strain ranges from 0 to 3000 μϵ. The high temperature sensitivity and ultralow strain sensitivity indicate that the proposed sensor can effectively eliminate the cross-sensitive issue of temperature and strain. In addition to excellent sensing performances, simple and compact structure make the proposed sensor be potential in practical applications.","['Temperature sensors', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Temperature measurement', 'Strain', 'Optical fibers', 'Sensitivity', 'Refractive index']","['Fiber optical sensor', 'few-mode fiber', 'photonic crystal fiber']"

"The transient ultraviolet (UV) and visible luminescent dynamics of the metal-oxide-semiconductor light-emitting diodes (MOSLEDs) made on Si-rich SiO x with its O/Si composition ratio detuning from 0.75 to 1.62 are investigated. The size and luminescent wavelength of the buried Si quantum dots (Si-QDs) are controlled by adjusting the O/Si composition ratio of the Si-rich SiO x . Time-resolved photoluminescence shows a lifetime decaying from 11.5 μs to 67 ns with the Si-QD size reducing from 4.5 to >; 1.7 nm. The shorter lifetime for smaller Si-QDs is due to the increased nonphonon-assisted carrier recombination rate in smaller Si-QDs. The Si-QD size shrinkage is obtained by enlarging the O/Si composition ratio via the increase in the N 2 O/SiH 4 fluence ratio during synthesis, which makes the SiO x matrix approaching a standard dioxide with a higher turn-on threshold field under Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. By increasing the O/Si composition ratio from 1.15 to 1.54, the obtained EL pattern changes its color from red to blue, which is associated with the turn-on voltage increasing from 40 to 175 V. Decreasing the Si-QD size to 1.7 nm inevitably attenuates the EL power to 100 nW and reduces the P/I slope to 0.63 mW/A. The UV EL patterns of MOSLEDs made on the SiO 1.62 film are demonstrated with an EL power of 40 nW, and the decay of ITO transmittance to <; 30% at an EL wavelength of <; 375 nm also contributes to the power attenuation.","['Silicon', 'Films', 'Substrates', 'Annealing', 'Plasma temperature', 'Radiative recombination', 'Light emitting diodes']","['Silicon nanophotonics', 'quantum dots and single molecules', 'light-emitting diodes']"

"We propose and demonstrate a viewing-angle-enhanced integral imaging display (VAEIID) system that uses a time-multiplexed, two-directional sequential projection (TTSP) scheme and a directional elemental image generation and resizing (DEIGR) algorithm. The main idea behind the method is sharing the same image screen to display two-directional elemental image (DEI) sets with a time-multiplexed sequential projection scheme. The proposed system consists of three processes: acquisition of depth and color information of a real object using the Microsoft Kinect sensor, generation of two DEI sets considering two different angular perspectives using a DEIGR algorithm, and projection of two sets of DEIs using the TTSP scheme. Due to the two-directional projections, each elemental lens of the lens array collects two-directional illuminations from the two sets of elemental images (EIs) projected in a time-multiplexed sequential manner by using the TTSP scheme; this produces two point light sources (PLSs) at different positions on the focal plane of the lens array. The positions of the PLSs are predefined and are determined in terms of projection angle. In this case, the viewing angle comprises the combination of two diverging ray bundles emerging from the two DEI sets projected from two angular directions. As a result, the viewing angle of the proposed VAEIID system is enhanced by almost twice that of the conventional method.","['Lenses', 'Arrays', 'Image color analysis', 'Three-dimensional displays', 'Optical imaging', 'Data mining']","['Integral imaging', 'VAEIID system', 'TTSP scheme', 'DEIGR algorithm', 'directional elemental image (DEI)']"

"This article put forwards a simple microwave photonics measurement method for microwave doppler frequency shift (DFS) and angle of arrival (AOA), which obtains the information conveniently and precisely by comparing the frequency and phase shift between two channels signals. The DFS direction can be judged more intuitively thanks to the introduction of the reference signal. The system uses two parallel dual parallel Mach-Zehnder modulators (DPMZMs) for carrier suppression single-sideband (CS-SSB) modulation. A proof-of-concept experiment was taken, showing that during ±100 kHz, the DFS measurement error is <±0.1 Hz over a 40 GHz frequency range as well as power sensitivity is down to −50 dBm. What is more, the measurement error of AOA is < ±1° from 0° to 90°.

"The silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is a promising solution to realize both the longer distance and higher data rate in visible light communication (VLC). However, it suffers from nonlinear distortions induced by SiPM. The Volterra nonlinear equalization (VNLE) is commonly used at the receiver to compensate for the nonlinear distortions, but it has a huge implementation complexity. As an alternative, the memory polynomial based equalization (MPE) offers significantly reduced complexity but at the cost of degrading BER performance. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a promising simplified VNLE equalizer for SiPM based OFDM-VLC systems according to SiPM's characteristics. Results show that the proposed equalizer outperforms the MPE in terms of BER and significantly reduces the computational complexity of the conventional VNLE. With the proposed equalization scheme, a data rate of 1.35Gbps has been achieved.

"The dielectric mirror is an important optical component for optoelectronic devices, passive photonic devices, and solar cells. Unfortunately, the reflection bandwidth of distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) and high-index contrast mirrors (HCGs) are limited by the index contrast of the material system used. Here, an aperiodic design for dielectric mirrors is proposed, and it is shown that for a fixed index contrast, the bandwidth of the reflection band can be arbitrarily widened by simply incorporating more dielectric layers. This is pronouncedly different from the fixed bandwidth of HCGs and DBRs. The physics behind the broadband reflection for the aperiodic stacking is identified as the photonic bandgap widening due to the annihilation of the quasi-guided modes in nonperiodic structures. This observation applies very well to aperiodic auto-cloned 3-D photonic crystal reflectors, to aperiodic DBRs, and even to diffuse dielectric mirrors that have recently emerged to be very promising for solar cells due to their zero plasmonic absorption nature.

"A comprehensive study on the transient response of fiber-grating Fabry-Perot (FGFP) laser is numerically conducted. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) is used as a wavelength selective element to control the external optical feedback (OFB) level. In addition to the external OFB level, the effect of other external cavity parameters such as temperature, injection current, dc-bias level, coupling coefficient, and gain compression factor on transient response characteristics of the laser are investigated. The temperature dependence (TD) of response characteristics is calculated according to TD of laser parameters instead of well-known Pankove relationship. Results show that, by increasing the laser injection current, the relaxation oscillation's amplitude, frequency, and damping rate are increased, while the laser turn-on time delay is reduced. In addition to the injection current and dc-bias level, the turn-on time delay can be reduced by increasing OFB reflectivity.

"Hybrid radio frequency (RF) and visible light communication (VLC) networks can provide high throughput and energy efficiency with VLC access points (APs) while ensuring ubiquitous coverage with RF APs. Due to dynamic channel conditions and limited resources, the hybrid RF/VLC networks’ resource allocation problem is complex and challenging. Conventional resource allocation techniques fail to overcome these challenges. Heuristic methods can solve high complexity problems; however, they are not robust against changes such as dynamic channel conditions or alternating user requirements. Heuristic methods require centralized control for stability which adds communication overhead between APs. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solutions can solve high complexity, dynamic channel conditions, and alternating user requirements while not requiring centralized control. In this paper, we formulate a distributed downlink power allocation problem to optimize the transmit power for users to reach target data rates in hybrid RF/VLC networks. Then, we propose a distributed DRL-based algorithm Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to solve the formulated computationally-intensive problem. We implement a simulation environment to benchmark the proposed distributed DRL-based method against other methods such as Q-Learning (QL) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and centralized heuristic power allocation algorithms. Our simulation results show that the distributed DDPG-based algorithm learns to adapt against changes in the channel or user requirements, while centralized Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization-based algorithms fail to endure against these changes even with coordination between APs. Additionally, we quantify the performance of the DDPG-based algorithm to prevail amid DRL-based algorithms at the expense of higher implementation complexity.","['Resource management', 'Heuristic algorithms', 'Quality of service', 'Optimization', 'Hybrid power systems', 'Radio frequency', 'Optical filters']","['DRL', 'heuristic algorithms', 'hybrid RF/VLC networks', 'resource allocation']"

"One of technical challenges in laser inter-satellite link (ISL) is the mitigation of performance degradation caused by pointing errors and angle-of-arrival (AoA) fluctuations arising unavoidably from satellite movements and vibrations. In this paper, we propose the dynamic adaptive beam control (ABC) technique implementable by using variable focus lenses (VFLs) at both the transmitter and receiver. In this technique, we monitor the instantaneous pointing error and AoA fluctuation induced by satellite vibrations and then provide feedback corrections to the VFL-based ABC system. The VFLs at the transmitter and receiver adjust their focal lengths adaptively to the amount of pointing error and AoA fluctuation, respectively, to minimize the link loss. VFLs operated by electro-wetting or electromagnetic actuator are fast enough to respond to the vibrations. We design the proposed dynamic ABC system for laser ISL by using the double-lens configuration and VFLs. An exemplary system design is presented when commercially available VFLs are utilized. Our simulation study shows that the proposed dynamic ABC technique offers improved transmission performance, compared to the static and the dynamic ABC technique applied to either the transmitter or receiver.","['Laser beams', 'Optical transmitters', 'Vibrations', 'Receivers', 'Optical beams', 'Fluctuations', 'Apertures']","['Adaptive beam control', 'free space optical communications', 'inter-satellite communications']"

"Power scaling of continuous-wave, narrow-linewidth fiber lasers are limited by the onset of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) which manifests at threshold as potentially damaging, peak power, backward propagating pulses. While several SBS mitigation techniques exist, optical linewidth broadening through external phase modulation using white noise is predominantly used for its simplicity. But the broadened line-shape is non-ideal and has a slow roll-off resulting in increased SBS seeding from reflections and hence limited power scaling. With better line-shape control, higher output powers can be achieved. In this work, we propose a simple and effective technique to improve the SBS suppression of these high power, narrow linewidth, noise broadened systems, by the addition of a sinusoidal modulation in cascade. The dual modulation results in an improved line-shape with a relatively flat topped-center and fast roll-off when compared to pure noise modulation at similar root-mean-square (RMS) linewidths. Using a multi-stage fully polarization maintaining, kW-class amplifier, we demonstrate >2.3X enhancement in SBS limited output power when compared to the pure noise modulated case at ∼7.3 GHz and >1.029 kW output power at ∼10.4 GHz RMS linewidth.","['Scattering', 'Modulation', 'Power generation', 'Phase modulation', 'Power amplifiers', 'Power lasers', 'Optical fiber polarization']","['Stimulated Brillouin scattering', 'phase modulation', 'white noise source', 'sinusoidal modulation', 'high power fiber lasers', 'narrow linewidth', 'power scaling', 'kilo-watt class']"

"We experimentally investigate the performances of an optical reservoir computing (RC) system based on two parallel time-delay reservoirs composed of two semiconductor lasers (SLs) subject to optical feedback. In such a system, the information being processed is split into two parts to send into two reservoirs through directly modulating the pump currents of two SLs, and the temporal output of the two SLs are sampled and taken as the virtual node states for training and testing. Via Santa Fe time series prediction task and multi-waveform recognition task, the performances of the proposed RC system are investigated and compared with those of the system based on one reservoir. The results show that the system based on two parallel reservoirs behaves better performance and stronger parameter robustness than that based on one reservoir. Moreover, through analyzing the dependence of the system performances on the number of virtual node states actually used for readout, the potential data processing rate (DPR) of the system is evaluated. For processing a prediction task under guaranteeing the normalized mean square error below 0.1 and a recognition task under guaranteeing the signal error rate below 0.005, the potential DPR of the proposed RC system can achieve 200 MSa/s, which is twice the DPR of the system with only one reservoir.","['Reservoirs', 'Task analysis', 'Optical feedback', 'Feedback loop', 'Optical pumping', 'Training', 'Time series analysis']","['Reservoir computing (RC)', 'semiconductor laser (SL)', 'time-delay reservoirs', 'chaotic time series prediction', 'multi-waveform recognition']"

"We studied the transverse mode instability (TMI) characteristics of few-mode fiber laser amplifier employing ytterbium-doped fiber (YDF) with core/cladding diameter of 30/400 μm under different bending diameters. The gain fiber is coiled in ellipse shape with minimum bending diameter changed from 9 cm, 10 cm, 11 cm to 12 cm in the bending part, and the experimental results show an anomaly characteristic of TMI. The TMI threshold improved from 772 W, 1149 W and 1458 W to 1641 W when the bending diameter of YDF increase from 9 cm, 10 cm, 11 cm to 12 cm, accompanied by the deterioration of beam quality from 1.60, 1.67, 1.87 to 1.95. This is mainly because tightly bending in few-mode fiber will promote the overlap between modes and lead to mode coupling, which may trigger TMI. Besides, the bending losses of HOMs decrease while bending diameter increasing, so that there is higher output efficiency and deteriorated beam quality when bending diameter increase. Although the phenomenon is not agreed with common TMI with near single-mode fiber laser, the result will be helpful for the design and power scaling of few-mode fiber lasers.","['Bending', 'Optical fiber amplifiers', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Fiber lasers', 'Optical fiber devices', 'Laser beams', 'Optical fiber theory']","['High power fiber lasers', 'transverse mode instability', 'bending diameters', 'few-mode fibers']"

"In this paper, an optimized detection based on log-maximum a posteriori estimation with the fixed number of surviving states (fixed-state Log-MAP) is proposed cooperating with equalizers to deal with spectral distortions for intensity-modulation and direct-detection (IM/DD) optical transmission systems. The equalizers compensate the spectral distortions caused by limited bandwidth and chromatic dispersion, and the optimized detection decodes the useful bits from equalized symbols with severe colored in-band noise. To more accurately extract the bits, the optimized detection with larger memory length is required. However, the classical optimized detection based on maximum likelihood-sequence estimation (MLSE) requires exponential-growing computational complexity and storage space with the increase of memory length. The fixed-state Log-MAP detection can decrease the computational complexity and storage space from the exponential order to linear order. Therefore, the fixed-state Log-MAP detection can support larger memory length to more accurately extract bits with less logic gate resources and storage resources compared to MLSE. We experimentally verified the fixed-state Log-MAP detection in a C-band 64Gbit/s IM/DD on-off keying optical system over a 100km dispersion-uncompensated link. The fixed-state Log-MAP detection not only improves the receiver sensitivity of 2dB, but also reduces the computational complexity and storage space by three orders of magnitude.","['Optical distortion', 'Computational complexity', 'Maximum likelihood estimation', 'Probability', 'Optical receivers', 'High-speed optical techniques', 'Optical sensors']","['Fixed-state Log-MAP detection', 'intensity-modulation and direct-detection', 'chromatic dispersion', 'spectral distortions']"

But, high-precise chiroptical detection is still a challenge. In this paper, a high-precise measurement of optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) based on weak value amplification (WVA) is presented. We proposed ORD detection method with parameter separation: by introducing complex coupling strength and dimensionless parameter “intensitiy contrast ratio” pointer, the ORD is only associated with the imaginary part of the weak value while circular dichroism (CD) is only associated with the real part. By designing a suitable WVA scheme, the ORD and CD can be measured separately.

"With distinguished advantages over radio frequency communication, visible light communication (VLC) has been considered as one of the potential and promising wireless communication technologies. However, the densely deployed light emitting diode (LED) lamps introduce severe inter channel interference (ICI), which drastically deteriorates the VLC network performance. In addition, the limited wireless access capabilities of heterogeneous LED lamps, as well as the different data transmission requirements of varied user equipments (UEs), will bring new challenges to the VLC network in real-life applications. To mitigate the ICI and improve the VLC network performance, the hypergraph theory is introduced in detail. Effective data links between one UE and all of its available LED access points (APs) are taken as a hyperedge to form an amorphous cell for each UE. Considering the UE satisfaction performance, as well as the spectrum efficiency and service fairness, the non-layered resource allocation (RA) algorithm based on carrier aggregation and the directly overlapped RA algorithm based on carrier aggregation and cooperative transmission are proposed.

We demonstrate the use of single-layer large-area graphene to indirectly modulate a THz QCL operating at 2.0 THz. By tuning the Fermi level of the graphene via a capacitively coupled backgate voltage, the optical conductivity and, hence, the THz transmission can be varied. We show that, by changing the pulsing frequency of the backgate, the THz transmission can be altered.

"With phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (Φ-OTDR), an optic fiber can be used as a distributed vibration sensor to perceive the external disturbance along the fiber through the phase variation of the Rayleigh backscatter light. However, due to the inevitable interference fading phenomenon, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of Rayleigh backscatter light at certain points is insufficient, thus affecting the fidelity of vibration sensing. In this paper, we propose the spectrum extraction and the rotated-vector-sum (SERVS) method to suppress the interference fading in the pulse-intensity-coding Φ-OTDR, which applies Golay complementary sequence through acousto-optic modulator (AOM). Benefited from the easier implementation, the experimental results demonstrate that the percentage of fading points can be reduced from 2.98% to 0.33% significantly and the standard deviation of differential phase is also decreased from 0.6556 rad to 0.2901 rad. Also the minimum level of averaged power spectral density (PSD) of the differential phase at whole locations along the fiber is reduced about 6 dB/Hz effectively. For the demodulated disturbance signal, no influence on the SNR is observed thus it maintains a SNR improvement of 8.6 dB compared to the traditional single pulse Φ-OTDR system, achieving a noise floor of 2.38 pϵ/√Hz.","['Fading channels', 'Interference', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Optical fiber amplifiers', 'Encoding', 'Optical pulses']","['Distributed optical fiber sensing', 'phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry', 'pulse coding', 'interference fading']"
"Owing to the lack of strong physical mechanisms capable of elaborately balancing a large number of longitudinal modes created in a self-seeded passive optical network (PON), the resulting coherent-like optical signals are vulnerable to frequency-dependent optical phenomena such as chromatic dispersion (CD). In this paper, based on our recently reported real-time dual-reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA)based self-seeded adaptive optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OOFDM) transmitters, detailed experimental explorations are undertaken, for the first time, of the impacts of intra-cavity CD on 10-Gb/s OOFDM transmissions over 25-km self-seeded PON systems. The cavity length-dependent intra-cavity CD effect is identified to be one of the most prominent physical mechanisms determining the practically achievable performance of such PON systems. In comparison with a 10-m-long dual-RSOA self-seeded fiber cavity, the accumulated intra-cavity CD effect associated with a 1-km-long dual-RSOA self-seeded fiber cavity not only considerably broadens the optical spectral width of the self-seeding-created coherent-like optical signal but increases the signal relative intensity noise (RIN) by 4.8 dB (at a 2-GHz signal spectral region) as well. In addition, a further 1.1-dB signal RIN growth is also measured after the 25-km single-mode fiber (SMF) PON system transmissions. As a direct result, the dual-RSOA self-seeded PON with a 1-km-long fiber cavity suffers from a 2.2-dB power penalty degradation for 10 Gb/s over 25-km SMF intensity modulation and direct detection OOFDM transmissions.","['Passive optical networks', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical transmitters', 'Cavity resonators', 'Optical filters', 'Optical attenuators']","['Self-seeded RSOAs', 'intra-cavity chromatic dispersion', 'fiber optics systems and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)']"

Next, the Log-Gabor even symmetric filter was used to perform Fourier transform, and the improved local phase sharpness feature and phase orientation feature were constructed respectively to replace the gradient amplitude and gradient direction feature of the image. A descriptor of local phase sharpness orientation (LPSO) was established through the log-polar description template, and finally the Euclidean distance was used to measure the similarity to obtain the corresponding points. Multiple sets of typical multi-source images were used as data sources, and the LPSO algorithm was compared with SIFT, LGHD, RIFT and HAPCG algorithms in datasets.

"From Shanon's theory, we know that information capacity is a logarithmic function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but a linear function of the number of dimensions. By increasing the number of dimensions D , we can dramatically improve the spectral efficiency. At the same time, in D -dimensional space (D\ >\ 2) , for the same average symbol energy, we can increase the Euclidean distance between signal constellation points compared with the conventional in-phase (I)/quadrature (Q) 2-D signal space. The 4-D space, with two phase coordinates per polarization, has already been intensively studied. To satisfy the ever-increasing bandwidth demands, in this paper, we propose the D -dimensional signaling (D\ >\ 4) by employing all available degrees of freedom for transmission over a single carrier including amplitude, phase, polarization, and orbital angular momentum (OAM). The proposed modulation scheme can be called hybrid D -dimensional modulation as it employs all available degrees of freedom. The proposed hybrid 8-D coded-modulation scheme outperforms its 4-D counterpart by 3.97 dB at a bit error rate (BER) of 10^{-8} while outperforming its corresponding polarization-division-multiplexed (PDM) iterative polar quantization (IPQ)-based counterpart by even a larger margin of 6.41 dB (at the same BER). The improvement of the proposed scheme for two amplitude levels per dimension and D = 8 over conventional PDM 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is indeed a striking 8.28 dB at a BER of 2 \times 10^{-8} .",[],[]
"Due to countless orthogonal eigenstates, light beams with orbital angular momentum(OAM) have a large potential information capacity. Recently, deep learning has been extensively applied in recognition of OAM mode. However, previous deep learning methods require a constant distance between laser and receiver. The accuracy will drop quickly if the distance of testing set deviates from the training set. Previous deep learning methods also have difficulty distinguishing OAM modes with positive and negative topological charges. In order to further exploit the huge potential of the countless dimension of state space, we proposed multidimensional information assisted deep learning flexible recognition (MIADLFR) method to make use of both intensity and angular spectrum information for the first time to achieve recognition of OAM modes unlimited by the sign of TC and distance with high accuracy. Also, MIADLFR can reduce the computational complexity significantly and requires much smaller training set.","['Training', 'Deep learning', 'Laser beams', 'Testing', 'Atmospheric modeling', 'Feature extraction', 'Convolutional neural networks']","['Orbital angular momentum', 'atmospheric turbulence', 'deep learning', 'optical detection']"

"We design and numerically evaluate a new type of III-nitride n-i-p solar cells whose p- and n-type regions with equal carrier concentration of 3 × 10 18 cm -3 are not generated by extrinsic impurity doping but by the so-called polarization-induced doping, which is induced by the graded In x Ga 1-x N layers of linearly increasing (from x= 0% to 30%) and decreasing (from x= 30% to 0%) indium composition to construct the conductive p- and n-type regions, respectively. Because of the identical and uniform polarization charges within each unit cell, a smooth spatial variation of the potential profile of the device is, hence, expected, which mitigates the energy band discontinuities at heterointerfaces and facilitates transportation and collection of photogenerated carriers with high efficiency. Most importantly, as the conductive n- and p-type regions are formed by electrostatic field ionization but not by the thermal activation, the concentration of field-induced carriers is independent of thermal freeze-out effects. Thus, the polarization-induced doping III-nitride n-i-p solar cells can provide stable power conversion efficiency, even when operated at low temperatures.","['Doping', 'Photovoltaic cells', 'Absorption', 'Gallium nitride', 'Indium', 'Electric fields', 'Materials']","['Polarization-induced doping', 'III-nitride', 'n-i-p solar cells', 'wurtzite structure.']"

The absorption performance of this optimized structure is comparable to that of a more complex structure with the same total thickness but more layers, or a structure with the same number of layers but a larger total thickness.

"High-fidelity photodetection enables the transfer of the low noise inherent to optical oscillators to the microwave domain. However, when photodetecting optical signals of the highest timing stability, photodiode flicker (1/f) noise can dominate the resulting timing jitter at timescales longer than ~1 ms. With the goal of improving femtosecond-level timing fidelity when transferring from the optical to microwave domain, we vary the duty cycle of a train of optical pulses and show that the photodetector flicker phase noise on a photonically generated 1 GHz microwave signal can be reduced by ~10 dB under ultrashort pulse illumination, reaching as low as -140/f dBc/Hz. In addition, a strong correlation between amplitude and phase flicker noise is found, implying a single baseband noise source can modulate both quadratures of the microwave carrier. These findings expand the limits of the ultimate timing stability that can be transferred from optics to electronics.","['1f noise', 'Phase noise', 'Optical pulses', 'Microwave photonics', 'Microwave oscillators', 'Ultrafast optics', 'Microwave theory and techniques']","['1/f noise', 'microwave phase noise', 'photodiodes']"

"Persistent efforts on developing advanced and complex data algorithms to enable the vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) for data beyond 100-Gbit/s has been reviewed in this paper. This endeavor not only elevates the bit rate of the IEEE802.3 standards for data center applications but also to initiate the unification of data format for wired and wireless network coverage. To date, the highest allowable data rates of the single-VCSEL-based optical link are 80 Gbit/s for the NRZ-OOK format under back-to-back (BtB) transmission 168 Gbit/s for the PAM-4 format over 150-m OM5 MMF, and the 224 Gbit/s for the QAM-OFDM format at BtB case. For the high-level complex data-format transmission with rigorous demand on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), this work demonstrates the most up-to-date 32-ray quadrature amplitude modulation generalized frequency division multiplexing (32-QAM GFDM) data algorithm with optimized amplitude and K value for encoding the multimode (MM) VCSEL. To achieve the higher spectral-usage efficiency based on the SNR spectrum for maximal transmission data rate, the bit-loading discrete multi-tone (DMT) technique is implemented by rearranging each subcarrier to the appropriate QAM levels. By utilizing 32-QAM GFDM and bit-loading DMT, the maximal data rate in the BtB case could respectively achieve 119.5 Gbit/s and 130 Gbit/s when operating the MM VCSEL at 55 °C. The transmission capacity of the VCSEL operated at 55 °C would decrease to 93.8 Gbit/s for 32-QAM GFDM and 83 Gbit/s for bit-loading DMT after propagating through OM5 MMF with modal dispersion.","['Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers', 'Data communication', 'Modulation', 'Bandwidth', 'Optical fibers', 'Standards', 'Optical fiber networks']","['Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL', 'multimode fiber (MMF)', 'non-to-zero on-off keying (NRZ-OOK)', '4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4)', 'quadrature amplitude modulation orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (QAM-OFDM)', 'quadrature amplitude modulation generalized frequency division multiplexing (QAM-GFDM)', 'bit-loading', 'discrete multi-tone (DMT)']"

"Toroidal multipoles, together with electric and magnetic multipoles, provide a complete description of electromagnetic responses of matter. The fundamental toroidal resonance has been extensively achieved and investigated in nanooptics, showing great ability to increase light absorption and light force. In this paper, we obtained plasmonic toroidal dipole resonance in core-shell (dielectric-core/gold-shell) nanodisk and demonstrated an enhanced second harmonic generation (SHG) from this resonance. It was shown that the toroidal dipole resonance based SHG depends on the refractive index of dielectric-core. For large refractive index cases, head-to-tail magnetic dipole pairs form a close loop, which is a signature of toroidal dipole and results in the enhancement of SHG. In addition, the frequency of this SHG red shifts as the refractive index of dielectric-core increases. We also investigated the cases in which the dielectric-core is filled with several common materials. Moreover, the toroidal resonance based SHG depends on both inner and outer radius of the core-shell nanodisk. Such results may serve for the developments of nonlinear nanooptics and their applications.","['Toroidal magnetic fields', 'Magnetic resonance', 'Absorption', 'Refractive index', 'Electric fields', 'Plasmons', 'Magnetic cores']","['Plassmonic toroidal resonance', 'second harmonic generation', 'metamolecule']"

"Terahertz (THz) propagation in periodic structures has attracted great attention because of its captivating electrical and optical properties. However, the created THz band gaps are usually considered to be caused by Bragg resonances. Here, we theoretically and numerically investigate THz resonances and their related band gap properties in a periodically corrugated plate waveguide with arbitrary wall profiles. It has been found that the corrugated structure can cause not only the interaction between the same transverse modes, called the Bragg resonance, but also the strong interference between different transverse standing wave modes, which occurs in a higher frequency range with quite different features. Unlike the well-known Bragg resonance, the excited resonances between different transverse modes can produce the stronger energy attenuation and wider frequency band gap. The dispersion diagram is depicted to clearly describe the relationship between these resonances and waveguide geometries. Using this method, we can properly estimate the band gap structure of THz waveguides, which has been confirmed by the simulated results. In addition, these two resonances can be easily manipulated by changing the symmetry of waveguide structures. These findings on THz propagation in periodic waveguides could be applicable in high performance devices, such as filters, modulators and switches.","['Optical waveguides', 'Dispersion', 'Resonant frequency', 'Photonic band gap', 'Waveguide theory', 'Harmonic analysis', 'Scattering']","['Resonances', 'transverse standing-waves', 'periodic corrugation', 'band gaps']"

Thus, two major objectives are considered for next-generation PONs (NG-PONs), i.e., first, bandwidth increase, and second, reach extension to reduce deployment costs. Here, we describe a new reach extension scheme that at the same time allows increasing the number of subscribers in the network. The amplification technique is based on a bidirectional semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). It is shown that the extender configuration not only meets the bandwidth and budget requirements for NG-PONs but also remarkably improves them. Differential (quadrature) phase-shift keying (D(Q)PSK) signals are investigated in this paper. Hybrid wavelength-division multiplexing/time-division multiplexing (WDM/TDM) transmission up to 120-Gb/s downstream and 40-Gb/s upstream are experimentally demonstrated. The access budget of 33.4 dB is achieved at 10 Gb/s on every WDM channel in case of DPSK enabling a splitting ratio of 1:512 per wavelength. Furthermore, optical power budget of 40 dB is obtained when DQPSK is used, where a splitting ratio of 1024 per wavelength can be supported. Additionally, a cost-efficient chirped managed directly modulated laser scheme is proposed for DPSK signal generation in U.S. scenario enabling a high-power budget performance low-cost transmitter configuration, which appears suitable for NG-PON application. The proposed technique also alleviates nonlinear impairments [specifically, cross-phase modulation (XPM)], which appear in dense WDM transmission.","['Passive optical networks', 'Optical transmitters', 'Wavelength division multiplexing', 'Semiconductor optical amplifiers', 'Optical receivers', 'Optical network units', 'Time division multiplexing']","['Next-generation passive optical network (NG-PON)', 'access networks', 'wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)', 'time-division multiplexing (TDM)', 'semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA)', 'differentially phase-shift keying (DPSK)']"

"In the scenario of downstream Passive Optical Networks (PON), we analyze through simulations and experiments a 100 Gbps/λ link using digital signal processing (DSP) over up to 50 km single mode fiber (SMF) in C-band. In particular, we propose chromatic dispersion digital pre-compensation (CD-DPC) and quaternary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) levels optimization at the transmitter side (TX), and simple non-linear compensation (NLC) in combination with adaptive equalization (AEQ) at the receiver side (RX). Regarding NLC, we compare two approaches: a quadratic polynomial function and a square-root-like function respectively. In this paper, we analyze in detail the performances of four proposed options, namely equispaced PAM-4 levels without NLC (baseline case), equispaced PAM-4 levels in combination with NLC, optimized PAM-4 levels without NLC, and optimized PAM-4 levels in combination with NLC. We demonstrate through simulations and experiments that optimized PAM-4 levels can only offer limited enhancement when NLC is applied, and up to 3.3 dB sensitivity gain can be obtained thanks to NLC at RX when setting the optimum parameters, with respect to the baseline case.","['Optical transmitters', 'Passive optical networks', 'Optical receivers', 'Optical losses', 'Fiber nonlinear optics', 'Optical fiber dispersion', 'Optical distortion']","['100 Gbps', 'direct-detection', 'electronic dispersion compensation', 'non-linear compensation']"
"A 20-km/60-Gb/s two-way passive optical network (PON) based on directly modulated two-stage injection-locked 1.55-μm vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) transmitters and negative dispersion fibers (NDFs) is proposed and demonstrated. A one-stage injection-locked technique has been confirmed as an effective approach for increasing the frequency response of a VCSEL. A two-stage injection-locked technique, which can further increase the frequency response of a VCSEL, is thereby expected to have excellent transmission performance in a two-way PON. To be the first to employ directly modulated two-stage injection-locked 1.55-μm VCSEL transmitters in a two-way PON, brilliant bit-error-rate performance and a clear eye diagram are obtained over a 20-km NDF transport. A directly modulated VCSEL has a positive chirp, whereas an NDF has a negative dispersion property in the transmission fiber; this negative dispersion property compensates the laser positive chirp and results in systems with better transmission performance. Such an innovative two-way PON provides the advantage of a communication link for high data rates, which is an attractive feature that is useful for broadband network applications.","['Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers', 'Optical transmitters', 'Passive optical networks', 'Dispersion', 'Frequency response', 'Bit error rate']","['Negative dispersion fiber', 'Passive optical network', 'Two-stage injection-locked', 'Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser']"

"In this paper, we have demonstrated birefringence modification in regenerated grating in polarization maintaining fiber (RGPMF) by using a CO 2 laser annealing technique. After conducting an isothermal annealing procedure followed by a slow cooling process, the birefringence of the RGPMF has been increased. This phenomenon can be explained by the changes in the thermal expansion coefficient and glass transition temperature of the stress applying part at different cooling rates. This process was reversible by reannealing with a subsequent fast cooling process. In our observation, the birefringence exponentially increases with a decreasing cooling rate. The highest and lowest records in the birefringence throughout the annealing process are 4.72 × 10 -4 and 3.46 × 10 -4 , respectively (a difference of 1.26 × 10 -4 ).

"The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (DUV LEDs) is still far from satisfactory due to the main issues of electron leakage and insufficient hole injection. The positive sheet charges generated by polarization at the interface between the last quantum barrier (LQB) and the p-type electron blocking layer (p-EBL) can induce electron accumulation and hole depletion in the vicinity of this interface, leading to electron leakage and hindering the hole injection. In this paper, we propose an Al-composition-increasing AlGaN layer (ACI-AlGaN) inserted between the LQB and p-EBL to enhance the carrier injection ability of DUV LEDs via modulating the sheet charges generated by polarization at the LQB/EBL interface and the underlying mechanism was analyzed by numerical calculation. The inserted structure can eliminate the positive sheet charges at the p-side interface of LQB and induce hole accumulation in the vicinity of the n-side interface of p-EBL, which can subsequently reduce electron leakage and favor hole injection respectively.

"The phenomenon of fast-light pulse propagation has seen renewed interest in recent years, but its relationship to the speed of information transfer is still being debated. In this paper, we define the speed of information transfer as the propagation speed of a point of constant signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the leading edge of a signal pulse. We use standard telecommunication analysis to include the effects of noise so that the bit-error rate (BER) can be calculated as a function of a variable decision time. We introduce the concept of a time-dependent Q-factor so that pulse arrival times can be compared at equivalent BERs. We show that when receiver noise is included in a gain-assisted fast-light system, the measured speed of information transfer can exceed the speed of light for an equivalent pulse travelling through a vacuum.","['Fast light', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Bit error rate', 'Pulse measurements', 'Optical propagation', 'Telecommunication standards', 'Q factor', 'Gain measurement', 'Velocity measurement', 'Noise measurement']","['Fast light', 'information transfer', 'pulse advancement', 'Q-factor']"

"To achieve flexible packet routing in a time wavelength-division multiplexing passive optical network (PON) architecture, most proposed systems use a tunable transceiver in the optical line terminal (OLT). The tunable transceiver is attractive for use in a PON system because it is able to broadcast and multicast packets within the entire PON system, being limited only to a single PON link. The proposed all-optical packet routing (AOPR) module was designed to incorporate a fixed-type wavelength OLT transmitter with a continuous-wave pump probe signal module. The design of the module is based on the ALL-ON method to support all broadcast signals, which replaces the wavelength tuning feature in the tunable OLT transmitter. The proposed architecture was designed using the multicasting cross-gain modulation (XGM) method. In this proposed design, the XGM function of the OLT system becomes a part of the AOPR OLT transmitter. The arrangement of this design aims to generate single or multiple wavelengths in a downstream direction in each OLT PON port. The measurement results revealed that the proposed system can handle a total of 160-Gb/s broadcast downstream bandwidth to serve 16 PON links using λ with a maximum of 2048 users.","['Passive optical networks', 'Ports (Computers)', 'Semiconductor optical amplifiers', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical transmitters', 'Optical filters', 'Optical network units']","['TWDM PON', 'all-optical packet routing', 'semiconductor optical amplifier', 'cross gain modulation', 'broadcasting and multicasting packet', 'NG-PON2']"

"In this paper, a novel and unique mobility support scheme for a color-clustered (CC) full-duplex multiuser (MU) bidirectional visible light communication (VLC) network is presented. Mobility is classified into two categories: intercluster and intracluster. In the proposed scheme, the mobility support is efficiently provided using a color filter array (CFA) at the downlink receiver. This CFA gives rise to receiver diversity in the form of selection combining yielding performance improvement. Simulations are conducted in terms of communication delay and frame loss rate relative to user speed and distance. In addition, the bit error rate (BER) performance and the data rate are analyzed in the CC MU VLC network.

"We describe a multi-carrier coherent-receiver scheme where the coherent beating between an ultra-high-speed multi-carrier signal and multiple optical local oscillators (OLOs) is conducted in a single optical hybrid, followed by carrier separation through an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) array. Sharing the optical hybrid for multiple OLOs simplifies the coherent receiver complexity and eases the timing alignment among multiple modulated carriers. Based on this scheme, a compact coherent-receiver front end consisting of an integrated 4 × 40 AWG array following a polarization-diversity optical hybrid is demonstrated and used for complete demodulation of a 1.12-Tb/s multi-carrier signal having ten 112-Gb/s polarization-division multiplexed (PDM)-quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) carriers spaced at 50 GHz. The required optical signal-to-noise ratio for the 1.12-Tb/s signal is 27 dB at 10 -3 bit error ratio. The cyclic feature of the AWG array allows the receiver to receive modulated carriers that are not adjacently spaced.

"We propose and demonstrate a novel architecture for four-wave mixing (FWM)-based recognition of spectral amplitude code (SAC) labels in optical packet-switched networks. With a proper code design, a unique FWM idler for each SAC label, referred to as a label identifier (LI), is generated in a nonlinear medium. A serial array of fiber Bragg gratings is then used to reflect the LI wavelengths. Each LI is associated with a unique amount of delay between two optical signals received at two photodiodes (PDs). Label recognition is then achieved by measuring this unique time delay (referred to as the characteristic delay). The main advantages of the proposed method include the following: no serial-to-parallel conversion is required, simple label extraction is achieved, variable-length packets are supported, and the number of PDs used in the label recognition module is reduced. Moreover, the LI wavelengths do not need to exhibit any periodicity or match a particular wavelength grid; this results in a less challenging code design with smaller spectral occupancy for label generation. An experiment is conducted, where two variable-length data packets are transmitted over a 50-km dispersion-compensated span and switched at a forwarding node. The SAC labels are successfully recognized, and we obtain error-free transmission for the switched packets with less than 0.3-dB penalty.","['Optical packet switching', 'Payloads', 'Optical mixing', 'Optical switches', 'High-speed optical techniques', 'Optical attenuators']","['Optical packet switching', 'four wave mixing (FWM)', 'label recognition', 'spectral amplitude codes (SACs)']"

"This paper investigates the ergodic capacity performance of hybrid free space optics (FSO)/ radio frequency (RF) system by employing an adaptive-combining-based switching scheme. In the adaptive combining scheme, the FSO and RF links are combined using the maximal-ratio combining (MRC) at the output, when the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the FSO link drops below a predefined threshold SNR value. The FSO link experiences the atmospheric turbulence, which is modeled using the generalized Malaga distribution, non-zero boresight misalignment or pointing errors, and atmospheric attenuation, under two types of detection techniques, i.e. heterodyne detection (HD) and intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD). Similarly, the fading of the RF link is characterized using the generalizedκ–μdistribution. In particular, we derive the probability density function (PDF) of the instantaneous SNR of the adaptive combining scheme. Capitalizing on the SNR statistics, we obtain the unified closed-form ergodic capacity expressions for the adaptive-combining-based hybrid FSO/RF system. In addition, the asymptotic expressions for the ergodic capacity of the system at the high-SNR region are presented.

"This paper investigates optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (O-OFDM) systems with index modulation (IM) based on discrete Hartley transform (DHT) for visible light communications (VLC). An interesting trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and bit error rate (BER) performance can be made by using the IM technique. And the DHT-based O-OFDM-IM systems can achieve higher SE compared with the DFT (discrete Fourier transform)-based counterparts. Employing DHT instead of DFT enables the removal of the Hermitian symmetry requirement, which contributes to transmitting more index bits and results in SE improvement. To acquire the same SE, the proposed systems can significantly lower the constellation order leading to better BER performance by contrast with the DFT-based counterparts. We employ DC (direct current) biasing and AC (Asymmetrically clipped) techniques to investigate the O-OFDM-IM systems in this paper.

"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) based on free-space optical (FSO) systems combine the benefits of both the high data rate of the FSO and the mobility of UAV. However, cumulative effects of laser beam divergence and turbulence-induced fading on the received irradiance in the FSO link might allow an external eavesdropper located near the authorized receiver to break the transmission under certain conditions. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a technique of secure communication that employs quantum mechanics-based cryptography principles. A combination of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) and Gaussian modulation of quantum coherent states (GMCS) enables a relatively secure communication system against collective attacks over FSO transmission links. However, the performance is restricted and degraded due to the influence of atmospheric turbulence and excess noise.

The investigation is conducted by considering the classification of seven multiplexed channels of 20 Gbaud, each with six commonly used modulation formats, including polarization division multiplexing (PDM)-BPSK, PDM-QPSK, and PDM-MQAM with (M = 8, 16, 32, 64). The classification performance is assessed under different values of optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) and in the presence of channel interference, channel chromatic dispersion, phase noise, and1stpolarization mode dispersion (PMD). Furthermore, the effect of fiber nonlinearity on the MFI accuracy is investigated. A well-established machine learning algorithm based on histogram features and a convolutional neural network has been used in this investigation. Results indicate that accurate identification accuracy can be achieved within the OSNR range of practical systems and that the MFI accuracy of side subcarriers outperforms that of middle subcarriers at a fixed value of OSNR. The results also show that the MFI accuracy of PDM-16QAM and PDM-64QAM are affected more by channel interference than the other modulation formats, especially when the ratio of the subcarrier bandwidth to subcarriers spacing is≥1.4. Finally, laboratory experiments have been conducted for validation purposes. The experimental results were found in good agreement with those achieved by simulation.","['Optical fiber networks', 'Modulation', 'Optical fiber dispersion', 'Fiber optics', 'Optical noise', 'Optical polarization', 'Optical modulation']","['Machine learning', 'modulation format identification', 'super-channel optical networks']"
"Optical networks-on-chips (ONoCs) are burgeoning structures of communication that can give a solution to the bandwidth and latency for multiprocessor systems-on-chips. Furthermore, photonic devices are widely used in ONoCs but suffer from crosstalk noise. Therefore, crosstalk noise is the critical factor that affects signal transmission and limits the network scale of ONoCs. To reduce the crosstalk noise sharply, an angle optimization that uses the cross angle of 60° or 120° instead of the conventional angle of 90° is proposed to optimize the Crux router. Furthermore, we present a signal transmission system simulation model for the mesh-based ONoC. For different routers applied to the mesh-based ONoC, the simulation model can present the time-domain waveform, eye diagram, and bit-error-rate (BER) curve clearly. On the basis of the analytical model, the results show that the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a 7 × 7 mesh-based ONoC is 20.9 dB when using optimized Crux routers, and the injection power is equal to 0 dBm, which is 2.1 dB better than using Crux routers. Therefore, the application of angle optimization to the Crux router and mesh network can minimize crosstalk noise and improve the scalability of mesh-based ONoCs.","['Crosstalk', 'Optical crosstalk', 'Optical noise', 'Optical switches', 'Optical waveguides', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Bit error rate']","['Angle optimization', 'crosstalk noise', 'signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)', 'bit error rate (BER)', 'optical router', 'mesh-based ONoCs']"

"A new photosensitivity physical model for Ge-doped silica preforms based on color-center photoreactions is presented. Simulation results are in close agreement with experimental results obtained by several condensed matter physics research groups working in this field, suggesting that the photoreactions of this model may, indeed, describe the physical processes involved in Ge-doped silica preform photosensitivity. The proposed photosensitivity model is defined by two differential equations that describe the temporal evolution of a set of color-center concentrations. The first is a modification of a very fast reversible reaction previously proposed by Fujimaki , where the reaction precursor has a different chemical structure (it is a neutral oxygen divacancy NODV unrelated to the previously proposed germanium lone pair center GLPC). The chemical structure of this precursor defect explains the generation of nonintrinsic neutral oxygen monovacancy (NOMV) color centers. These centers are transformed into GeE ' defects by means of a second nonlinear reaction. This justifies the slow increase in the absorption peak experimentally measured at 6.3 eV, which had no satisfactory explanation.","['Absorption', 'Preforms', 'Silicon compounds', 'Chemicals', 'Photonics', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Optical device fabrication']","['Optical properties of photonic materials', 'fiber gratings', 'modeling']"

"The efficient use of optical nonlinearities in silicon is crucial for the implementation of silicon-based photonic devises. In this paper, we present an approximate analytical study of nonlinear polarization rotation in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides; the rotation is predominantly caused by the effects of self-phase modulation and cross-phase modulation, stemming from the anisotropic Kerr nonlinearity. In the first part of the paper, we analyze the transmittance of the Kerr shutter in the continuous-wave regime and address the problem of its optimization. It is essential for the generality of our conclusions that both free-carrier effects and two-photon absorption are properly accounted for in this study. We specifically show that the signal transmittance may be optimized by adjusting the waveguide length, the pump power, and the incident linear polarizations of pump and signal beams. In the second part of the paper, we examine the problem of power equalization with SOI waveguides.

Using the resonance condition derived by Rosenkrantz and Arnon, we obtain frequencies at which the electromagnetic (EM) radiation stimulates resonance over a wide range of modes. Our results confirm that the relation between the resonance frequencies and the excess surface charge can be described by a monotonically increasing function. Taking the derivative of this function, it is evident that the lower surface potentials have a greater influence on the resonance frequency. This effect decreases as the surface potential increases. Surface modes contribute to the surface energy of charged NPs, and for this reason, they can modify charged NP optical properties. We found that there is a strong dependence of the resonance frequencies on the electrically charged NP refractive index and surface potential.

"The potential for visible light communications with SU-8 planarized InGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is investigated experimentally. For large-size LEDs, current crowding occurring near the n-contact is addressed by shrinking the dimensions of the emitters/pixels, along with the use of parallel-connected schemes to achieve multipixel emissions. Through improved heat dissipation, current uniformity, and light extraction efficiency, the resulting LED matrices fabricated with 6×6 pixels outperform conventional LEDs in terms of light output power and current-induced spectral shift. It was also found that good control of the SU-8 planarization process and optimizing the number of pixels facilitates the fabrication of high-efficiency LED matrices. In addition, the presence of large junction capacitance caused by the parallel connection of the individual pixels prevents these LED matrices with 6×6 pixels from operating at high speed.

"The optical-phased array (OPA) has gained special interest in recent years as a high-speed and compact imaging device. While large-scale OPAs have been demonstrated in single-pixel imaging, the complexity of the driver circuit is becoming a crucial problem as the number of phase shifters increases. Here, we investigate the phase shift requirement of OPA for single-pixel imaging and demonstrate, for the first time, that full 2π phase shifts are not mandatory to generate a set of illumination patterns with a sufficient degree of randomness required to reconstruct the image. Using a silicon photonic OPA chip with 128 carrier-depletion-based phase shifters, we experimentally confirm this property by successfully retrieving an image under a maximum phase shift of only ∼1.5π without affecting the quality of the image. Consequently, the input voltage can be reduced significantly. Since the carrier-depletion phase shifters generally require high driving voltages, this finding paves the way to high-speed OPA-based imaging with a minimum device requirement.","['Imaging', 'Lighting', 'Phase shifters', 'Optical imaging', 'Voltage', 'Optical amplifiers', 'Optical fibers']","['Optical imaging', 'optical phased array', 'photonic integrated circuits', 'single-pixel imaging']"

"Conventional radiative cooling devices are white or silver in color to achieve high reflectance in the solar spectral range. However, a versatile color that can be applied to the radiative cooler is required for practical application. To determine the boundary between coloration and cooling performance, the reflectance in the visible range should be fine-tuned. Here, this paper presents a spatially-segmented colored radiative cooler (SSCRC), which is a 2-dimensional micro-patterning of colored areas, with angle-robustness. By using the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) optical resonator incorporating high refractive index dielectric ( i.e., TiO 2 ), the SSCRC shows consistent coloration in a wide-angle ranging up to 70°. In addition, the spatial segmentation introduced in the colored radiative cooler coordinates the relationship between solar absorption and vivid coloration. We perform the systematic designs in terms of spectrum, thermal analyses, and color coordinates.

"Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) originate from resonance coupling between surface-bound electrons and photons on interfaces with specific material properties. Unfortunately, owing to the existence of SPPs on an interface, its reach is plagued by intrinsic dissipative losses in the materials making up the interface, severely restricting the application domain. One way to reduce the propagation losses is to use distributed electrical injection across the interface to create a population inversion to provide energy to the decaying SPP wave. A promising technique is to use a Schottky junction formed between a semiconductor and a metal because such an interface can sustain a population inversion under electrical injection. We previously analyzed the plasmonic dispersion relation for such a device when biased. Here, we extend that analysis to consider the influence of the inversion layer when minority carriers are injected from an external electrical source. In particular, we derive analytical expressions for the loss reduction and associated gain spectrum broadening, taking into account the doping concentration in the semiconductor and the externally applied voltage across the junction. Our analysis gives vital information for the design and utilization of Schottky junction interfaces as active waveguides for routing SPPs in integrated circuitry.","['Plasmons', 'Junctions', 'Stimulated emission', 'Electric potential', 'Electric fields', 'Metals']","['Active plasmonics', 'material gain', 'modal gain', 'Schottky junction']"

"High-order modulation formats with high symbol rates are promising candidates for meeting the growing traffic requirements of digital coherent transmission. In using these modulation formats, the impact of transceiver impairment on the signal quality becomes significant.

Furthermore, we extend the equalizer for digital subcarrier (SC) multiplexing.

"Stripped-back representative VCSEL devices with a simple fabrication process that very closely approaches the performance of standard BCB-planarised devices have been produced. These VCSEL Quick Fabrication (VQF) devices achieve threshold currents only 0.3 mA higher than that of a standard device produced from the same material. The predictability of standard performance from VQF performance is also robustly assessed in terms of temperature effects to account for the observed disparities. These VQF devices are then processed across a 6-inch (152 mm) wafer and the resulting device-level characteristics are mapped. From this, it is apparent that there is an approximately radial decrease in oxide aperture diameter from centre to edge, found to be driven by the strain-induced wafer bow. After corrections, a residual spatial variation across the wafer remains, which, in conjunction with temperature dependent measurements, is shown to be a result of epi-material variation. By observation at 50 °C, that is, at a temperature closely resembling that of intended application, the residual centre-to-edge variation in threshold current density is found to be only 0.2 kA/cm 2 , compared to 1.3 kA/cm 2 when observing the room temperature variation of devices of nominally equivalent active volumes.","['Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers', 'Oxidation', 'Apertures', 'Performance evaluation', 'Compounds', 'Standards', 'Temperature measurement']","['Epitaxy', 'manufacturing', 'VCSEL', 'wafer']"

"The key advantage of silicon photonics comes from its potential for large scale integration, in a low-cost and scalable fashion. This has sustained the growth in the area despite disadvantages such as the lack of a monolithic light source, or the absence of a second order non-linear response (χ (2) ). Thus far, the work in the field has focused on reporting individual devices from a single die, with excellent performances. Wafer-level results, an area which has not been addressed sufficiently, is a critical aspect of silicon photonics and will provide the community with information regarding scalability and variation, which will be the key differentiating advantage of silicon photonics over other photonic platforms.

Using 2-D carrier-hopping prime codes (CHPCs), the modulation model and a novel 2-D hard-limiting decoder are designed and validated with OptiSystemTMsimulations.

"At nano-scale new phenomena have been discovered, allowing devices’ miniaturisation, energy harvesting, and power reduction. The Extraordinary Optical Transmission (EOT) phenomenon was reported in 1998 by Ebessen, who stated that the resonant peaks in the response of metallic nano antennas were more intense than predicted by classical diffraction theories. Years later, the main reason for this behaviour was attributed to the Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPP), at least in ultraviolet and visible regions. In this article, a new method to model the radiation-matter interaction on a dielectric-metal interface is proposed, based on Maxwell’s equations and Fresnel Coefficients in absorbing media. Transmission percentage, angle and propagation length are obtained for a rigorous sweep on incident angle and wavelength. The results taken using some noble metals allow us to observe the presence of surface phenomena at expected SPP resonances. First, it is noticeable huge values of transmission in ultraviolet and visible regions, meaning that the metal does not reflect all the radiation. Also, the transmission angle tends to be higher, meaning huge surface components. Furthermore, the transmission length is on orders of 50-100 nm, meaning that phenomena as EOT only occurs at the nano-scale, since waves should arrive at another interface before being absorbed.","['Metals', 'Optical reflection', 'Optical surface waves', 'Optical diffraction', 'Surface plasmon polaritons', 'Permittivity', 'Oscillators']","['Extraordinary optical transmission', 'light patterns', 'nano antennas', 'optical devices', 'subwavelength structures', 'surface plasmon polaritons']"

"A novel optical fiber sensor based on cascade anti-resonant reflection waveguide (ARRW) and fiber ring-shaped structure (FRSS) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for simultaneous measurement of refractive index (RI) and temperature. The sensor is very simply fabricated by splicing ARRW and FRSS based on Mach-Zehnder interference (MZI). The FRSS interference dip is sensitive to external RI and temperature changes, whereas the ARRW structure's loss dip is only sensitive to external temperature. As a result, this sensor can be used to measure both RI and temperature simultaneously. The sensor's maximum RI sensitivity is 108.61 nm/RIU and its maximum temperature sensitivity is 19 pm/ °C in the experiment. This sensor is a good choice when it is necessary to measure RI and temperature at the same time due to its compact size, high sensitivity, low cost, and good stability.","['Temperature measurement', 'Temperature sensors', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Interference', 'Optical fibers', 'Bending', 'Sensitivity']","['Anti-resonant reflection waveguide', 'fiber ring-shaped structure', 'RI measurement', 'temperature measurement']"

"An undersampling free-space optical (FSO) communication system based on compressive sensing (CS) and in-fiber grating is proposed. Our proposal drastically mitigates the data scale unfavorable issue and reduces the great amount of required data. Also, our proposal employs low-bandwidth and low-cost photodetectors (PDs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and decreases the cost of data detection. Besides, the data transmitted in the free space is encrypted, which enhances the security of the system. The in-fiber grating, which has the advantage of highly efficient thanks to its inherent compatibility with optical fiber links, plays the roles of light emitter, in-fiber polarizer, and light diffraction device, simultaneously. A sinusoidal radio frequency (RF) signal with a frequency of 1 GHz is utilized for a 2.4 m data transmission. And each PD with a bandwidth of 300 MHz is employed for detecting the transmitted signal on each channel. The proposal obtains data compression ratios of 25%, 15%, and 5% both in the temporal domain and frequency domain. Besides, a two-tone signal and a random RF signal are applied in the proposed FSO transmission for data transmission.

"We analyze a silicon reconfigurable feed-forward optical delay line (ODL) composed of cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) switches and waveguide delay pairs. Optical delay is step-tuned by switching among optical routes with an incremental length difference. The crosstalk caused by limited extinction ratios (ERs) of MZI switches and the waveguide loss restricts the ODL buffering capacity. A method to suppress the crosstalk and hence expand the buffering capacity is proposed by inserting variable optical attenuators (VOAs) between successive MZI switches. A design example shows that a seven-stage ODL without VOAs can delay 8-98 bits with a tuning step of 1 bit for a 40 Gbit/s non-return-to-zero (NRZ) 2 13 - 1 pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) optical signal. When VOAs with a 10 dB attenuation ratio are included, the signal-to-crosstalk ratio (SCR) of the output signal is increased by 17 dB on average, making the ODL capable of delaying 8-135 bits at its maximum.","['Optical attenuators', 'Optical switches', 'Optical buffering', 'Optical interferometry', 'Optical waveguides', 'Optical crosstalk', 'Optical resonators']","['Optical delay line (ODL)', 'Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI)', 'variable optical attenuator (VOA)', 'silicon photonics', 'integrated optical device']"

"Chaos generation from a semiconductor laser under band-rejection optical feedback is proposed and investigated numerically and experimentally. The band-rejection feedback performs better than the conventional broadband mirror feedback in concealing the feedback delay time information measured by the time-delay signature (TDS) of optical field and intensity. In this work, the optical band-rejection filter (BRF) is built up based on the transmission of a Bragg grating. The best concealment of delay time information is achieved in the form of simultaneous TDS suppression in optical field and intensity when the BRF is negatively detuned from the free-running laser frequency. Such concealment is due to the suppression of feedback cavity modes by the band-rejection effect. The concealment prefers negative detuning frequency because the laser cavity resonance is red-shifted by optical feedback due to the antiguidance effect. The negatively detuned BRF suppresses the TDS of optical field and intensity by more than an order of magnitude than mirror feedback. The simulation results are qualitatively confirmed by the experimental measurements.","['Optical feedback', 'Laser feedback', 'Delays', 'Chaos', 'Semiconductor lasers', 'Mirrors', 'Resonant frequency']","['Band-rejection filter (BRF)', 'chaos', 'optical feedback', 'semiconductor laser', 'time-delay signature (TDS)']"

"Quantum information processing (QIP) relies on delicate superposition states that are sensitive to interactions with environment, resulting in errors. Moreover, the quantum gates are imperfect so that the use of quantum error correction coding (QECC) is essential to enable the fault-tolerant computing. The QECC is also important in quantum communication and teleportation applications. The most critical gate, i.e., the CNOT gate, has been implemented recently as a probabilistic device by using integrated optics. CNOT gates from linear optics provide only probabilistic outcomes and, as such, are not suitable for any meaningful quantum computation (on the order of thousand qubits and above). In this paper, we show that arbitrary set of universal quantum gates and gates from Clifford group, which are needed in QECC, can be implemented based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED). Moreover, in CQED technology, the use of the controlled- Z gate instead of the CNOT gate is more appropriate. We then show that encoders/decoders for quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can be implemented based on Hadamard and controlled- Z gates only using CQED. We also discuss quantum dual-containing and entanglement-assisted codes and show that they can be related to combinatorial objects known as balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs). In particular, a special class of BIBDs-Steiner triple systems (STSs)-yields to low-complexity quantum LDPC codes.

"Most optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) research literature has focused on chip-synchronous OCDMA. However, practical OCDMA networks are inherently chip-asynchronous since users transmit their signals from different locations without any coordination. This paper focuses on binary chip-asynchronous OCDMA with time spreading, and the main result is that appropriate nonuniform signaling can achieve a data throughput of 2.5 bits per OCDMA chip. This result shows that the presence of chip asynchronism leads to approximately a threefold capacity gain over chip-synchronous OCDMA capacity. Additional results are presented to illustrate that the near capacity multiuser interference has a low variance and a non-Gaussian distribution. Finally, the robustness of the achieved capacity gains is verified in the presence of additive channel noise.","['Optical receivers', 'Delays', 'Adaptive optics', 'Optical pulses', 'Multiaccess communication', 'Optical modulation']","['Optical code division multiple access (OCDMA)', 'nonuniform signaling', 'chip asynchronism', 'channel capacity']"

Furthermore, based on the asynchronous amplitude histogram (AAH) evaluation method, a novel histogram processing method, which is more convenient, is proposed and investigated. Experimental results show that the monitoring scheme for CD is independent of optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) within a certain range.

"Digital coherent superposition (DCS) for optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarrier pairs with Hermitian symmetry can simultaneously reduce the inter-carrier interference (ICI) from laser phase noise and cancel the fiber nonlinearity to the first order. In this paper, we study an interesting scenario, where we upgrade the conventional OFDM with 4-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) to DCS-OFDM with 16-QAM, which have equal spectrum efficiency and require no change on hardware. We conduct a simulation to compare the tolerance to the laser phase noise and fiber nonlinearity, which are the main concerns for such an upgrading. First, the 16-QAM DCS-OFDM relaxes the laser linewidth requirement and performs better with a smaller fast Fourier transform size. Second, the nonlinear tolerance of 16-QAM DCS-OFDM is better when the nonlinear effects appear. The nonlinear tolerance of DCS-OFDM depends on the dispersion compensation scheme. The maximum SNR improvement is 3.4 dB with full post-dispersion compensation, and it can increase to 6.6 dB with symmetrical dispersion compensation at the launch power of 4 dBm. Finally, we verify that the maximum SNR improvement of 16-QAM DCS-OFDM with full post-dispersion compensation is 3.7 dB at the launch power of 6.2 dBm in the experiment.","['OFDM', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Laser noise', 'Optical fiber dispersion', 'Phase noise', 'Optical fibers']","['Coherent optical communications', 'optical OFDM', 'digital coherent superposition', 'phase noise mitigation']"

"In this paper, we develop a novel Physical Layer Security (PLS) technique for a Visible Light Communication (VLC) system composed of light fixtures assisted by mirror array sheets serving as Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS). Our objective is to optimize the Secrecy Capacity (SC) by finding the optimal beamforming (BF) weights equipped at the VLC fixtures and mirror orientations at the mirror array sheet. Due to many design parameters, including the beamforming weights, the mirror orientations, and the mobility of the users, conventional optimization techniques may not be practical to optimize the SC capacity. Therefore, we proposed a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to solve the highly complex SC problem by adjusting the BF weights and mirror orientations. The DDPG-based algorithm provides an optimized solution that can adapt to the large size of design parameters and act fast to the channel variations due to users’ mobility. Our results show that considering both mirror array sheet and BF vectors provide the highest SC for the system. Moreover, we show the effect of changing the mirror arrangements of the mirror array sheet on SC. We conclude that for a fixed mirror array sheet size, there exists a specific mirror arrangement (i.e., number of mirrors) that optimizes the SC. After this number, the performance of SC saturates. We also show the trade-off between the training complexity and SC performance considering different mirror arrangements in the mirror array sheet.","['Mirrors', 'Visible light communication', 'Fixtures', 'Radio frequency', 'Receivers', 'Security', 'Optimization']","['Deep reinforcement learning', 'intelligent reflecting surfaces', 'physical layer security', 'secrecy capacity', 'visible light communications']"
"Accurate recognition of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes is a major challenge for OAM-based optical communications over atmospheric turbulence channels. The turbulence-induced distortions cause difficulties for the receiver to distinguish between adjacent OAM modes.

To improve the recognition performance, we propose a vortex modulation method that can magnify the subtle differences between closely adjacent OAM states. This allows the CNN to capture the image features more effectively and to recognize the topological charges more accurately. Numerical results show high recognition accuracy for both integer topological charges and fractional ones even under strong turbulence intensity and long propagation distance, which demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.","['Phase modulation', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Deep learning', 'Optical vortices', 'Optical imaging', 'Optical distortion', 'Demodulation']","['Orbital angular momentum (OAM)', 'vortex phase modulation', 'convolutional neural network (CNN)', 'atmospheric turbulence', 'free space optical communication']"
"The interference fringes are the key of white-light interference to reconstruct the 3D topography. An Interference Fringes Discoverer (IFD) model based on Deep Learning is presented to automatically recognize the fringes, which is a key step in the automation of the interferometer. This is the first time that deep learning techniques is applied to the recognition of interference fringes.","['Feature extraction', 'Interference', 'Proposals', 'Convolution', 'Kernel', 'Shape', 'Optical interferometry']","['Interferometry', 'IFD model', 'convolutional neural network', 'fringes-detection']"
"Correction performance of an adaptive optics (AO) system is severely limited by its system latency under high temporal frequency distortions. Wavefront prediction methods has been proven to be an effective way to compensate system delay. A novel wavefront prediction method based on residual learning fusion network (RLFNet) is proposed in this paper. The network is able to eliminate redundant information between adjacent wavefront frames and fuse refined features, which provides a higher prediction accuracy under fewer priori wavefront input. The method is tested on a 1km laser atmospheric transmission experimental setup through high frequency atmospheric turbulence, where wavefront data is collected from a 1kHz Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWS). We show that the proposed architecture is able to predict the second frame wavefront after the previous 6 frames with a root-mean-square (RMS) wavefront error reduction up to 53% compare to non-predictive method.","['Atmospheric modeling', 'Atmospheric waves', 'Predictive models', 'Feature extraction', 'Prediction algorithms', 'Delay effects', 'Data models']","['Adaptive optics', 'atmospheric turbulence', 'neural network', 'wavefront prediction']"
"Defect modes (DMs) of parity-time (PT) symmetry in FSE are investigated. Below phase transition point (PTP), eigenvalues have same symmetry as PT potential. Above it, DMs cause complex values, symmetric property is destroyed. More positive DMs merge together and more PTPs appear. Only one PTP exists for negative DMs, moves into higher gaps. It further deepens understating FSE, and may provide potential applications, such as beam controlling, routing light, in complex potential.","['Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions', 'Bifurcation', 'Optical diffraction', 'Periodic structures', 'Optical beams', 'Diffraction', 'Indexes']","['Defect modes', 'parity-time symmetry', 'fractional Schrodinger equation']"
