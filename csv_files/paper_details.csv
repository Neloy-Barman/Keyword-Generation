"Light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which will be increasingly used in lighting technology, will also allow for distribution of broadband optical wireless signals. Visible-light communication (VLC) using white LEDs offers several advantages over the RF-based wireless systems, i.e., license-free spectrum, low power consumption, and higher privacy. Mostly, optical wireless can provide much higher data rates. In this paper, we demonstrate a VLC system based on a white LED for indoor broadband wireless access. After investigating the nonlinear effects of the LED and the power amplifier, a data rate of 1 Gb/s has been achieved at the standard illuminance level, by using an optimized discrete multitone modulation technique and adaptive bit- and power-loading algorithms. The bit-error ratio of the received data was 1.5\cdot 10^{-3} , which is within the limit of common forward error correction (FEC) coding. These results twice the highest capacity that had been previously obtained.",[],[]
"We present a slot-waveguide-based ring resonator in silicon on insulator (SOI) with a footprint of only13 μm×10 μm, fabricated with optical lithography. Experiments show that it has 298 nm/RIU sensitivity and a detection limit of4.2⋅10−5 RIUfor changes in the refractive index of the top cladding. We prove for the first time that surface chemistry for selective label-free sensing of proteins can be applied inside a 100 nm-wide slot region and demonstrate that the application of a slot waveguide instead of a normal waveguide increases the sensitivity of an SOI ring resonator with a factor 3.5 for the detection of proteins.","['Biosensors', 'Optical ring resonators', 'Silicon on insulator technology', 'Proteins', 'Optical waveguides', 'Biomedical optical imaging', 'Optical refraction', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical variables control', 'Lithography']","['Biosensor', 'ring resonator', 'silicon on insulator', 'slot waveguide']"
"Metamaterials are artificial composites that acquire their electromagnetic properties from embedded subwavelength metallic structures. In theory, the effective electromagnetic properties of metamaterials at any frequency can be engineered to take on arbitrary values, including those not appearing in nature. As a result, this new class of materials can dramatically add a degree of freedom to the control of electromagnetic waves. The emergence of metamaterials fortunately coincides with the intense emerging interest in terahertz radiation (T-rays), for which efficient forms of electromagnetic manipulation are sought. Considering the scarcity of naturally existing materials that can control terahertz, metamaterials become ideal substitutes that promise advances in terahertz research. Ultimately, terahertz metamaterials will lead to scientific and technological advantages in a number of areas. This article covers the principles of metamaterials and reviews the latest trends in terahertz metamaterial research from the fabrication and characterization to the implementation.","['Metamaterials', 'Magnetic materials', 'Frequency', 'Optical resonators', 'Permittivity', 'Permeability', 'Dielectric materials', 'Optical materials', 'Electromagnetic radiation', 'Photonics']","['Metamaterials', 'THz optics']"
"Many novel materials and device designs have been proposed as photonic analogs to electrical diodes over the last four decades. This paper seeks to revisit these materials and designs as advanced technologies may enable experimental realization that was not possible upon conception of several of these designs. The background behind integration challenges, including waveguide birefringence, fabrication tolerances, garnet/semiconductor mismatch, and optimized interfaces will hopefully spark new ideas that will finally enable the realization of integrated optical isolators and circulators.","['Garnets', 'Isolators', 'Faraday effect', 'Magnetooptic devices', 'Optical waveguides']","['YIG', 'isolators', 'circulators', 'nonreciprocal optics', 'Faraday rotation', 'beatlength', 'quasi phase matching', 'birefringences', 'non-reciprocal phase shift', 'NRPS', 'wafer-bonding', 'Bi:YIG', 'Ce:YIG', 'push/pull']"
"In this paper, we present a comprehensive channel modeling and characterization study for visible light communications. Our study is based on ray tracing, which allows for an accurate description of the interaction of rays emitted from the lighting source within a specified confined space. Contrary to existing works, which are mainly limited to ideal Lambertian sources and purely diffuse reflections, our approach is capable of obtaining channel impulse responses (CIRs) for any nonideal sources, as well as specular and mixed specular-diffuse reflections. Furthermore, we can precisely reflect the presence of objects (e.g., furniture) and wavelength-dependent reflection characteristics of surface materials (e.g., ceilings, floor, walls, and furniture) in a channel study. As case studies, we consider a number of indoor environments with various dimensions and different surface materials, i.e., plaster, gloss paint, wood, aluminum metal, and glass. We further consider various scenarios with different transmitter specifications (i.e., single versus multiple transmitters and array type) and receiver specifications (i.e., location and rotation). For each environment, we obtain CIRs and present a channel characterization study where channel parameters, such as channel DC gain, root mean square (RMS) delay spread, coherence bandwidth, and mean excess delay, are obtained. We also make one-to-one comparisons between infrared and visible-light CIRs for the same environments to emphasize the differences between two optical bands.","['Reflection', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Reflectivity', 'Solid modeling', 'Ray tracing', 'Visible light communication', 'Indoor environments']","['Visible light communications', 'channel modeling', 'ray tracing']"
"In order to realize fast and accurate estimation of intercore crosstalk in bent multicore fibers (MCFs), an analytical expression of the average power-coupling coefficient (PCC) based on an exponential autocorrelation function is, for the first time, derived, resulting in no need for heavy numerical computations. It is revealed that, when the bending radius is large and the correlation length is large, the average PCC is inversely proportional to the correlation length and to the square of the propagation constant difference Δβ mn between core m and core n, and when the bending radius is small and the correlation length is large, the average PCC is proportional to the bending radius and is independent of the correlation length. When the correlation length is small, on the other hand, the average PCC is proportional to the correlation length and is independent of the bending radius. For homogeneous MCFs (Δβ mn = 0) with small bending radius, the average PCC coincides with the mean crosstalk increase per unit length derived from the coupled-mode theory of Hayashi et al. that is proportional to the bending radius. Average crosstalk values calculated by using the analytical expression derived here are in excellent agreement with those of numerical solutions of coupled-power equations, irrespective of the values of bending radius and correlation length.","['Correlation', 'Crosstalk', 'Optical fiber networks', 'Optical fiber theory', 'Propagation constant', 'Mathematical model', 'Integral equations']","['Multicore fiber (MCF)', 'intercore crosstalk', 'coupled-power theory (CPT)', 'power-coupling coefficient (PCC)', 'analytical expression']"
"PECVD silicon nitride photonic wire waveguides have been fabricated in a CMOS pilot line. Both clad and unclad single mode wire waveguides were measured at λ = 532, 780, and 900 nm, respectively.

"This paper introduces an optical vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system based on an optical wireless communication technology using an LED transmitter and a camera receiver, which employs a special CMOS image sensor, i.e, an optical communication image sensor (OCI). The OCI has a “communication pixel (CPx)” that can promptly respond to light intensity variations and an output circuit of a “flag image” in which only high-intensity light sources, such as LEDs, have emerged. The OCI that employs these two technologies provides capabilities for a 10-Mb/s optical signal reception and real-time LED detection to the camera receiver. The optical V2V communication system consisting of the LED transmitters mounted on a leading vehicle and the camera receiver mounted on a following vehicle is constructed, and various experiments are conducted under real driving and outdoor lighting conditions. Due to the LED detection method using the flag image, the camera receiver correctly detects LEDs, in real time, in challenging outdoor conditions. Furthermore, between two vehicles, various vehicle internal data (such as speed) and image data (320 × 240, color) are transmitted successfully, and the 13.0-fps image data reception is achieved while driving outside.","['Optical transmitters', 'Optical imaging', 'Optical receivers', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Cameras', 'Optical sensors']","['Optical wireless communication (OWC)', 'visible light communication (VLC)', 'LED transmitter', 'camera receiver', 'CMOS image sensor', 'vehicle-to-vehicle communication']"
"We present relationships for the free-carrier-induced electrorefraction and electroabsorption in crystalline silicon over the 1-14-μm wavelength range. Electroabsorption modulation is calculated from impurity-doping spectra taken from the literature, and a Kramers-Kronig analysis of these spectra is used to predict electrorefraction modulation. More recent experimental results for terahertz absorption of silicon are also used to improve the commonly used 1.3- and 1.55-μm equations. We examine the wavelength dependence of electrorefraction and electroabsorption, finding that the predictions suggest longer wave modulator designs will, in many cases, be different from those used in the telecom range.","['Absorption', 'Silicon', 'Refractive index', 'Doping', 'Modulation', 'Mathematical model', 'Photonics']","['Absorption', 'electrooptic modulators', 'semiconductor impurities', 'silicon']"
"In this paper, we carry out a unified performance analysis of a dual-hop relay system over the asymmetric links composed of both radio-frequency (RF) and unified free-space optical (FSO) links under the effect of pointing errors. Both fixed and variable gain relay systems are studied. The RF link is modeled by the Nakagami-m fading channel and the FSO link by the Gamma-Gamma fading channel subject to both types of detection techniques (i.e., heterodyne detection and intensity modulation with direct detection). In particular, we derive new unified closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function, the probability density function, the moment generating function (MGF), and the moments of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of these systems in terms of the Meijer's G function. Based on these formulas, we offer exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP), the higher order amount of fading, and the average bit error rate (BER) of a variety of binary modulations in terms of the Meijer's G function. Furthermore, an exact closed-form expression of the end-to-end ergodic capacity is derived in terms of the bivariate G function. Additionally, by using the asymptotic expansion of the Meijer's G function at the high-SNR regime, we derive new asymptotic results for the OP, the MGF, and the average BER in terms of simple elementary functions.","['Relays', 'Radio frequency', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Rayleigh channels', 'Probability density function', 'Bit error rate']","['Free-space optics (FSO)', 'mixed RF/FSO systems', 'Nakagami-m fading', 'atmospheric turbulence', 'pointing errors', 'outage probability (OP)', 'bit-error rate (BER)', 'ergodic capacity', 'Meijer’s G function']"
"An optical wireless communication (OWC) system based on a light-emitting-diode (LED) transmitter and a camera receiver has been developed for use in the automotive area. The automotive OWC system will require Mb/s-class data rates and the ability to quickly detect LEDs from an image. The key to achieving this is improvements to the capabilities of the image sensor mounted on the camera receiver. In this paper, we report on a novel OWC system equipped with an optical communication image sensor (OCI), which is newly developed using CMOS technology. To obtain higher transmission rates, the OCI employs a specialized “communication pixel (CPx)” capable of responding promptly to optical intensity variations. Furthermore, a new quick LED detection technique, based on a 1-bit flag image which only reacts to high-intensity objects, is formulated. The communication pixels, ordinary image pixels, and associated circuits (including 1-bit flag image output circuits) are then integrated into the OCI. This paper describes the design, fabrication, and capabilities of the OCI, as well as the development of the LED and image sensor based OWC system, which boasts a 20-Mb/s/pixel data rate without LED detection and a 15-Mb/s/pixel data rate with a 16.6-ms real-time LED detection.","['Optical transmitters', 'Optical imaging', 'Optical sensors', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Vehicles', 'Optical receivers', 'Cameras']","['Optical wireless communication (OWC)', 'visible light communication (VLC)', 'light-emitting diode (LED)', 'complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor', 'image sensor based OWC', 'automotive communication system']"
"The fabrication studies of silica/polystyrene (PS) colloidal microlens arrays with various aspect ratios were performed on the III-nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The use of colloidal-based microlens arrays led to significant enhancement in light extraction efficiency for III-nitride LEDs. In varying the aspect ratios of the microlens arrays, the engineering of various PS thicknesses was employed by using high-temperature treatment and redeposition process. The effects of PS thickness on the light extraction efficiency and far-field emission patterns of InGaN quantum-well (QW) LEDs were studied. The total output powers of microlens LEDs with various PS thicknesses exhibited 1.93–2.70 times enhancement over that of planar LEDs, and the use of optimized PS layer thickness is important in leading the enhancement of the light extraction efficiency in large angular direction.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Lenses', 'Microoptics', 'Annealing', 'Suspensions', 'Fabrication', 'Scanning electron microscopy']","['III-Nitrides', 'light-emitting diodes (LEDs)', 'light extraction efficiency', 'microlens arrays', 'far-field radiation']"
"We demonstrate a switchable dual-wavelength synchronously pulsed fiber laser Q-switched by graphene saturable absorber. Wavelength-resolved studies on the output Q-switched pulses show that despite of large wavelength spacing up to 26 nm, the two Q-switched pulses at each individual wavelength can be temporally synchronized with per-pulse energy up to ~ 70 nJ. Further experiments show that by adjusting the intracavity birefringence, dual-wavelength emission can be switched to another dual-wavelength operation regime with wavelength separation of 5.7 nm.

"We simulate and analyze the mode properties and propagation effects of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes in a ring fiber. A ring fiber with 0.05 up-doping is designed in simulation to support up to 10 OAM modes while maintaining single-mode condition radially. With a multiple-ring fiber, tens of OAM modes can be potentially multiplexed to greatly enhance the system capacity and spectral efficiency. The mode index difference can be maintained above 10 -4 over hundreds of nanometers optical bandwidth. Higher order OAM modes' azimuthal intensity and odd-order OAM modes' azimuthal phase show better tolerance to the fiber ellipticity. Moreover, higher order OAM modes also have longer 2π and 10-ps walk-off length. After 600-km propagation, OAM 0,4 mode shows <; 10-ps mode walk- off, even in a ring fiber with 1% ellipticity. Also, in such an elliptical fiber, the well-aligned OAM modes with different charges have <;-20 dB intermode crosstalk. The improvement of the circularity for the ring fiber is expected to reduce the crosstalk and increase the demultiplexing efficiency.","['Multiplexing', 'Indexes', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Optical fiber networks']","['Fiber optics systems', 'multiplexing', 'optics', 'orbital angular momentum', 'waveguides']"
"In this paper, we report a direct comparison between coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) and photonic crystal waveguides (PhCWs), which have both been exploited as tunable delay lines. The two structures were fabricated on the same silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technological platform, with the same fabrication facilities and evaluated under the same signal bit-rate conditions. We compare the frequency- and time-domain response of the two structures; the physical mechanism underlying the tuning of the delay; the main limits induced by loss, dispersion, and structural disorder; and the impact of CROW and PhCW tunable delay lines on the transmission of data stream intensity and phase modulated up to 100 Gb/s. The main result of this study is that, in the considered domain of applications, CROWs and PhCWs behave much more similarly than one would expect. At data rates around 100 Gb/s, CROWs and PhCWs can be placed in competition. Lower data rates, where longer absolute delays are required and propagation loss becomes a critical issue, are the preferred domain of CROWs fabricated with large ring resonators, while at data rates in the terabit range, PhCWs remain the leading technology.","['Delay lines', 'Photonic crystals', 'Optical waveguides', 'Optical resonators', 'Optical ring resonators', 'Silicon on insulator technology', 'Propagation losses', 'Optical coupling', 'Optical device fabrication', 'Frequency']","['Slow light', 'delay lines', 'coupled resonators', 'rings', 'silicon photonics', 'photonic crystals', 'differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK)']"
"The communication between two legitimate peers in the presence of an external eavesdropper is studied from a physical-layer security perspective in the context of free-space optical (FSO) communications. We discuss viable mechanisms to eavesdrop the communication and study the effect of random optical irradiance fluctuations inherent to FSO communications on the probability of achieving a secure transmission. We observe that the joint effect of laser-beam divergence and turbulence-induced fading on the received irradiance, under certain conditions, allows an external eavesdropper close to the legitimate receiver to compromise the communication. Interestingly, we also observe that an eavesdropper placed close to the legitimate transmitter can easily compromise the communication by taking advantage of the larger attenuation suffered by the signal when propagating through the FSO link.","['Optical transmitters', 'Laser beams', 'Security', 'Optical receivers', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Signal to noise ratio']","['Atmospheric Turbulence', 'Free-Space Optical Communications', 'Physical Layer Security', 'Secrecy']"
"Radio-on-free space optical (RoFSO) communication systems are rapidly gaining popularity as an efficient and cost-effective means of transferring high data rates and radio frequency (RF) signals with the same capacity as optical fiber. However, the performance of those systems depends strongly on the atmospheric conditions and the nonlinear characteristics of the optical link. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model for the transmission of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based signals over freespace optics (FSO) links. Further, we derive a closed-form bit error probability (BEP) and outage probability expressions, taking into account the optical noises, the laser diode nonlinear distortion, and the atmospheric turbulence effect on the FSO channel modeled by the gamma-gamma distribution. This paper reports the most significant parameters that degrade the transmission performance of the OFDM signal over FSO links and indicates the cases that provide the optimal operating conditions for the link. The obtained results can be useful for designing, predicting, and evaluating the RoFSO system's ability to transmit wireless services over turbulent FSO links under actual conditions.","['Atmospheric modeling', 'Adaptive optics', 'Fiber nonlinear optics', 'Optical distortion', 'Radio frequency', 'OFDM', 'RF signals', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Analytical models']","['Free-space optics (FSO)', 'orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)', 'Radio over Fiber (RoF)', 'radio on FSO', 'gamma–gamma distribution', 'atmospheric turbulence.']"
"A simple configuration for the generation of tunable multiwavelength picosecond-pulse fiber ring lasers by exploiting the intracavity birefringence-induced comb filter is demonstrated. The fiber laser is passively mode locked by using nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) technique. The polarization-dependent isolator combined with the intracavity birefringence acts as two functions: the tunable comb filter and the mode locker. Up to four-wavelength picosecond pulses were simultaneously obtained in the experiment. The mode competition of the multiwavelength lasing is suppressed by the use of NPR-induced intensity-dependent loss. In addition, the number of the lasing wavelengths, the lasing location, and the spacing between the lasing wavelengths could be flexibly tuned by properly rotating the polarization controllers.","['Tunable circuits and devices', 'Fiber lasers', 'Laser mode locking', 'Ring lasers', 'Birefringence', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Erbium-doped fiber lasers', 'Filters', 'Optical pulse generation', 'Optical pulses']","['Multiwavelength lasers', 'passively mode-locked', 'fiber lasers', 'birefringence filter']"
"Theoretical and experimental studies of mid-infrared (mid-IR) suspended membrane waveguide (SMW) and suspended membrane ring (SMR) resonator are presented.

"We present manufacturing tolerances of cascaded silicon microring resonators fabricated in a commercial 130-nm complementary-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundry using 193-nm lithography and provide statistics gathered from over 500 four-channel microring arrays over multiple wafers and fabrication lots. We quantify intrawafer and interwafer variation of the position and relative spacing of resonance wavelengths for the microring arrays and confirm prior predictions that the absolute resonance positions of such devices cannot be controlled across wafers or even across reticles within a wafer. However, we show that the free spectral range (FSR) of the microrings can be controlled to within 0.66 nm (83 GHz) across wafers and lots, as can the wavelength spacing between closely spaced microrings. To exploit these findings for low-power optical interconnects, we suggest and demonstrate a synthetic resonant comb with FSR ≈ N * δλ, wherein resonance wavelengths are spaced equally across the FSR in order to minimize postfabrication tuning. The experimental CMOS 1 × 8 microring array requires an average tuning of less than 1.2 nm/channel to align to a 200-GHz wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) grid.

"The transmission performance of a free-space optical (FSO) link could be severely degraded due to atmospheric turbulence, which causes the temporal and spatial fluctuation of light intensity. Both the space diversity reception technique (SDRT) and advanced modulation formats can successfully mitigate the transmission impairments of the atmospheric turbulence. The purpose of this paper is to study and compare the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of several widely used modulation formats under different atmospheric turbulence scenarios with and without SDRT. The modulation formats studied in this paper include on–off keying (OOK), differential phase-shift keying (DPSK), and differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK). We derive a series-form formula for evaluating the BER performance of the DPSK format in the Gamma–Gamma distributed channel with SDRT. We use both theoretical analysis and simulation to examine the BER performance of OOK, DPSK, and DQPSK formats with and without SDRT. It is found that, in the strongly turbulent scenario, the OOK and DPSK formats can have as large as 19.5 and 20.3 dB of SDRT gains at the BER of10−3, respectively. Using SDRT, the modulation gains of the DPSK format over the OOK format are 3.2 dB in the strongly turbulent scenario and 4.5 dB in the weakly turbulent scenario, respectively. In addition, in the moderately and strongly turbulent scenarios, it is found that the DPSK and DQPSK formats have almost the same BER performance under the same symbol rate.",[],[]
"In this paper, for the first time, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid post equalizer in a high-order CAP modulation based VLC system. Considering that the linear and nonlinear distortions have been considered as the major obstacles to high-speed VLC transmission, some equalization schemes should be employed, including DFE, RLS, DD-LMS, and Volterra nonlinear equalizer. To eliminate both the linear and nonlinear distortions, we propose the use of a hybrid post equalizer consisting of a linear equalizer, a Volterra nonlinear equalizer, and a DD-LMS equalizer in a high-speed VLC system.

"Fluctuations of the optical power incident on a photodiode can be converted into phase fluctuations of the resulting electronic signal due to nonlinear saturation in the semiconductor. This impacts overall timing stability (phase noise) of microwave signals generated from a photodetected optical pulse train. In this paper, we describe and utilize techniques to characterize this conversion of amplitude noise to phase noise for several high-speed (>; 10 GHz) InGaAs p-i-n photodiodes operated at 900 nm. We focus on the impact of this effect on the photonic generation of low phase noise 10-GHz microwave signals and show that a combination of low laser amplitude noise, appropriate photodiode design, and optimum average photocurrent is required to achieve phase noise at or below -100 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset for a 10-GHz carrier. In some photodiodes, we find specific photocurrents where the power-to-phase conversion factor is observed to go to zero.","['Photodiodes', 'Masers', 'Photoconductivity', 'Phase measurement', 'Noise', 'Measurement by laser beam']","['Frequency combs', 'microwave photonics', 'photodetectors']"

"Deep-tissue multiphoton microscopy (MPM) enables noninvasive optical imaging into the deep regions of the tissue in animal models in vivo. High-order MPM techniques, such as three- and four-photon fluorescence microscopy at the 1700-nm window, are emerging as promising imaging techniques for deeper penetration. Currently, signal depletion at large imaging depth sets the depth limit for these imaging techniques. As a result, how to further boost signal level is the key to achieving a larger imaging depth. Contrary to the previous thought that overfilling the back aperture of the objective yields the highest multiphoton fluorescence signal, in this paper, through numerical simulation, we show that, due to the effect of exponential decay of the excitation beam, the signal generation is maximized for certain underfilling of the back aperture of the objective lens. This will provide a simple strategy for signal generation maximization in deep-tissue MPM and potentially enables deeper imaging penetration into the tissue.",[],[]
"The electrical and optical characteristics of InGaN quantum-well light-emitting diodes with large-bandgap AlGaInN thin barriers were analyzed with the consideration of carrier transport effect for efficiency droop suppression. The lattice-matched AlGaInN quaternary alloys with different compositions, thicknesses, and positions were employed as thin barrier layers (1-2 nm) surrounding the InGaN QW in LED structures. The increased effective barrier heights of AlGaInN thin barrier led to suppression of carrier leakage as compared to conventional InGaN QW LEDs with GaN barrier only.

Moreover, without the limitations of period-doubling bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation, by utilizing the period-one oscillation state with a single-beam injection scheme, the microwave signals generated with the proposed scheme have a much broader tuning range. In this paper, optical and power spectra of the microwave signals generated with the dual-beam optical injection scheme are compared with those generated with the optical mixing, the single-beam injection, and the unlocked dual-beam injection schemes. Generation of tunable microwave signals up to 120 GHz is demonstrated, which is currently limited by the locking range of the slave laser determined by the frequency difference between the Hopf (higher frequency) and the saddle node (lower frequency) bifurcation curves.","['Masers', 'Microwave oscillators', 'Microwave photonics', 'Optical mixing', 'Semiconductor lasers']","['Semiconductor lasers', 'instabilities and chaos', 'optical injection']"

"Light-emitting diode (LED)-based visible light communication (VLC), combining illumination and communication, is a promising technique for providing high-speed, low-cost indoor wireless services. In indoor environments, multiple LEDs routinely used as lighting sources may also be concomitantly invoked to support wireless services for multiple users, thus forming a multiuser multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Since the user terminals detect all the light rays impinging from multiple LEDs, inter-user interference may severely degrade the attainable system performance. Hence, we conceive a transceiver design for indoor VLC MU-MISO systems to suppress the multiuser interference (MUI). In contrast to classic radio-frequency (RF) communication, in VLC, the signals transmitted from the LEDs are restricted by optical constraints, such as the real-valued nonnegativity of the optical signal, the maximum permissible optical intensity, and the constant brightness requirements of the LEDs. Given these practical constraints, we design the optimal transceiver relying on the objective function of minimizing the maximum mean square error (MMSE) between the legitimate transmitted and received signals of the users and show that it can be readily found by solving a convex second-order cone program. Then, we also propose a simplified transceiver design by incorporating zero-forcing (ZF) transmit precoding (TPC) and show that the TPC coefficients can be efficiently found by solving a linear program.

"Chaotic dynamics of a semiconductor laser subject to distributed feedbacks from a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) are investigated through detailed simulations. Because of distributed reflections along the FBG, the approach of FBG feedback performs better than the conventional approach of mirror feedback in concealing the feedback delay time in chaos generation. The time-delay signature obtained from the autocorrelation function decreases as the FBG bandwidth decreases, which is attributed to the associated increase in the FBG dispersion. Such time-delay signature suppression is generally observed over a range of feedback parameters. The dynamical mappings of the laser subject to FBG feedback reveal large regions of chaotic states, except when the FBG bandwidth is much narrower than the relaxation resonance frequency of the laser.","['Laser feedback', 'Chaos', 'Fiber gratings', 'Semiconductor lasers', 'Fiber lasers', 'Distributed feedback devices']","['Semiconductor lasers', 'instabilities and chaos', 'fiber Bragg gratings']"

One laser carries 12.5 Gbaud optical baseband QPSK data, and the other acts as a carrier frequency generating laser. The two signals are heterodyne mixed at a photodetector in the RAU, and the baseband QPSK signal is transparently up-converted to the W-band.

"This paper investigates the average symbol error rate (ASER) performance of a dual-hop hybrid relaying system relying on both radio frequency (RF) and free-space optical (FSO) links. Specifically, an RF link is used for supporting mobile communication, whereas an FSO link is adopted as the backhaul of the cellular infrastructure. Considering nonline-of-sight RF transmissions and a generalized atmospheric turbulence (AT) channel, the associated statistical features constituted of both exact and asymptotic moment-generating functions are derived in the closed form. They are then used for calculating the ASER of M-ary phase-shift keying (PSK), differentially encoded noncoherent PSK (DPSK), and noncoherent frequency-shift keying. A range of additional asymptotic expressions is also derived for all the modulation schemes under high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). It is observed from the asymptotic analysis that the ASERs of all the modulation schemes are dominated by the average SNR of the RF link in the hybrid relaying system using a fixed relay gain, whereas in the relaying system using a dynamic channel-dependent relay gain, the ASERs of all the modulation schemes depend both on the average SNR and the AT condition of the FSO path. We also find that the fixed-gain relaying strategy achieves twice the diversity order of the channel-dependent relaying strategy, albeit at the cost of requiring a high power amplifier dynamic range at the relay node. Furthermore, by comparing the asymptotic ASERs, we calculate the SNR differences between the different modulation schemes in both the fixed-gain and channel-dependent relaying systems. Finally, simulation results are presented for confirming the accuracy of our expressions and observations.","['Radio frequency', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Scattering', 'Relays', 'Modulation', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Adaptive optics']","['Relay', 'atmospheric turbulence', 'free space optical communications', 'symbol error rate', 'hybrid RF/FSO']"

Strong Bragg gratings are easily inscribed using a 193-nm excimer laser and phase mask in microfiber drawn from the 62.5/125- μm standard multimode fiber (MMF) with no additional photosensitization treatment. The enlarged photosensitive core offered by the MMF provides a sufficient overlap between the fundamental mode and the induced refractive index modulation region, which significantly enhances the grating inscription efficiency. The grating inscription in the microfiber is even more efficient than that in the original MMF because the multibeam interference-induced fringe fuzziness in the normal size fiber does not occur as the fiber diameter down to the scale that is comparable with the Talbot length of the ultraviolet (UV)-writing light. The proposed method is beneficial for sensing and device applications of microfiber Bragg grating (mFBGs) because of the ease of fabrication, high coupling strength, and large wavelength separation between individual resonant dips.","['Bragg gratings', 'Fiber gratings', 'Couplings', 'Modulation', 'Silicon compounds']","['Fiber gratings', 'microoptics', 'sensors']"

"The transmission performance of multichannel adaptively modulated optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (AMOOFDM) signals is investigated numerically, for the first time, in optical-amplification-free and chromatic-dispersion-compensation-free intensity-modulation and direct-detection systems directly incorporating modulated distributed feedback (DFB) lasers (DMLs). It is shown that AMOOFDM not only significantly reduces the nonlinear wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) impairments induced by the effects of cross-phase modulation and four-wave mixing but also effectively compensates for the DML-induced frequency chirp effect. In comparison with conventional modulated optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), which uses an identical signal modulation format across all the subcarriers, AMOOFDM improves the maximum achievable signal transmission capacity of a central WDM channel by a factor of 1.3 and 3.6 for 40- and 80-km standard single-mode fibers, respectively, with the corresponding dynamic input optical power ranges being extended by approximately 5 dB.

"Experimental demonstrations are reported for end-to-end real-time optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OOFDM) transceivers incorporating three widely adopted adaptive loading techniques, namely, power loading (PL), bit loading (BL), and bit-and-power loading (BPL). In directly modulated distributed-feedback (DFB) laser-based, intensity-modulation, and direct-detection (IMDD) transmission systems consisting of up to 35-km single-mode fibers (SMFs), extensive experimental comparisons between these adaptive loading techniques are made in terms of maximum achievable signal bit rate, optical power budget, and digital signal processing (DSP) resource usage. It is shown that BPL is capable of supporting end-to-end real-time OOFDM transmission of 11.75 Gb/s over 25-km SMFs in the aforementioned systems at sampling speeds as low as 4 GS/s. In addition, experimental measurements also show that BPL (PL) offers the highest (lowest) signal bit rate, and their optical power budgets are similar. The observed signal bit rate difference between BPL and PL is almost independent of sampling speed and transmission distance. All the aforementioned key features agree very well with numerical simulations. On the other hand, BPL-consumed DSP resources are approximately three times higher than those required by PL.

"We demonstrate a remotely up-converted and distributed 20-Gbit/s wireless on-off-keying (OOK) data transmission link at the W-band that uses a near-ballistic uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (NBUTC-PD)-based photonic transmitter-mixer. This device consists of an active NBUTC-PD integrated with a planar passive circuit for feeding the intermediate-frequency (IF) modulation input and extracting the up-converted optical-to-electrical (O-E) output signals. An equivalent-circuit model is developed, which allows for the O-E and IF responses to be independently optimized. Accordingly, we can achieve both an ultra-wide O-E bandwidth (67-118 GHz) and IF modulation bandwidth (>;15 GHz) with a very-low coupling loss (<; 2 dB) from the NBUTC-PD to the WR-10 waveguide. We adopted a remotely distributed 1-ps optical pulse train source with a repetition rate at 93 GHz to serve as a high-performance photonic carrier, which is generated by a spectral line-by-line shaper utilizing the repetition-rate multiplication (RRM) technique.

We show that the generated solitonic state is sustained when the modulation is turned off adiabatically.

"Transmittance of a straight junction between two plasmonic slot waveguides can be enhanced by either coupling a perpendicular stub to the input waveguide or inserting an intermediate slot section between the waveguides. We derive analytic expressions for the transmission spectra in these two configuration schemes and analyze them to obtain simple formulas, relating the parameters of the stub and intermediate slot section that maximize the transmittance at a given frequency. A considerable advantage of our results over the recently reported approximations is in their broader applicability domain, which is the consequence of the correct accounting for the phase shift resulting from the reflection of the surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) at the end of the stub, and inclusion of ohmic losses. By the example of a 100-fs Gaussian pulse at the telecommunication wavelength of 1.55 m, we demonstrate that both transmission enhancement techniques can almost completely eliminate SPP reflection from the junction of 125- and 25-nm-gap silver-air-silver plasmonic waveguides, whereupon the preference can be given to either of the techniques, depending on the desired design features. Although, for concreteness, we studied a pair of aligned slot waveguides, the concepts of optics and transmission-line theory that we marry in our work are not specific for straight junctions and are well suited for analyzing more complex waveguide geometries.

"We propose and experimentally demonstrate a compact notch microwave photonic filter (MPF) using two integrated microring resonators (MRRs) on a single silicon-on-insulator (SOI) chip. The free spectral ranges (FSRs) of two cascaded MRRs are 160 GHz and 165 GHz, respectively. Due to the vernier effect, the transmission spectrum of cascaded MRRs is a series of bimodal distribution whose interval is an arithmetic sequence. By locating the laser wavelength at the middle of different bimodal intervals and fine tuning it properly, both central frequency and bandwidth of the notch MPF can be tunable. In the experiment, the tunability of central frequency and 3-dB bandwidth are demonstrated from 2.5 GHz to 17.5 GHz and from 6 GHz to 9.5 GHz, respectively.

"Horizontal slot waveguides based on graphene have been considered an attractive structure for optical waveguide modulators for transverse magnetic (TM) modes. Graphene is embedded in the slot region of a horizontal slot waveguide. If graphene were treated as an isotropic material and its dielectric constant were made close to zero by adjusting its Fermi level, the surface-normal electric field component of the fundamental TM mode of a horizontal slot waveguide might be highly enhanced in graphene. This could cause a large increase in the attenuation coefficient of the mode. This is called the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) effect. This paper discusses that graphene needs to be treated as an anisotropic material that has an almost real surface-normal dielectric constant component. Then, the ENZ effect does not exist. Approximate analytic expressions and numerical simulation are used for the discussion, and they demonstrate that horizontal slot waveguides are not appropriate for graphene-based modulators for TM modes.","['Graphene', 'Optical waveguides', 'Mathematical model', 'Electric fields', 'Modulation', 'Dielectrics', 'Optical attenuators']","['Waveguide devices', 'optical properties of photonic materials', 'graphene']"

However, in the field of precision metrology, there is a demand for observing the photonic SHE directly, which will significantly reduce the complexity of experiment and improve the efficiency. Therefore, we need to find some methods for greatly enhancing the spin-dependent splitting in photonic SHE.

"Optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) with advanced modulation format [e.g., quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK)] provides many transmission advantages.

"The efficient generation of polarized single or entangled photons is a crucial requirement for the implementation of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Self-organized semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are capable of emitting one polarized photon or an entangled photon pair at a time using appropriate electrical current injection. We realized a highly efficient single-photon source (SPS) based on well-established semiconductor technology: In a pin structure, a single electron and a single hole are funneled into a single InAs QD using a submicron AlO x current aperture. Efficient radiative recombination leads to emission of single polarized photons with an all-time record purity of the spectrum. Non-classicality of the emitted light without using additional spectral filtering is demonstrated. The out-coupling efficiency and the emission rate are increased by embedding the SPS into a micro-cavity. The design of the micro-cavity is based on detailed modeling to optimize its performance. The resulting resonant single-QD diode is driven at a repetition rate of 1 GHz, exhibiting a second-order correlation function of g (2) (0) = 0.

Intrinsic symmetry-lowering effects leading to the splitting of the exciton bright states are shown to be absent for this substrate orientation.

"We demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, a Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) sensor that is able to operate with a probe power larger than the Brillouin threshold of the deployed sensing fiber and that is free from detrimental nonlocal effects. The technique is based on a dual-probe-sideband setup in which an optical frequency modulation of the probe waves along the fiber is introduced. This makes the optical frequency of the Brillouin interactions induced by each probe wave on the pump vary along the fiber so that two broadband Brillouin gain and loss spectra that perfectly compensate are created. As a consequence, the pulse spectral components remain undistorted, avoiding nonlocal effects. Therefore, very large probe power can be injected, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in detection for long-range BOTDA. Moreover, the probe power can even exceed the Brillouin threshold limit due to its frequency modulation, which reduces the effective amplification of spontaneous Brillouin scattering in the fiber. Experiments demonstrate the technique in a 50-km sensing link in which 8 dBm of probe power is injected.","['Time-domain analysis', 'Brillouin scattering', 'Frequency modulation', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical pulses', 'Optical pumping', 'Optical distortion']","['Brillouin distributed sensors', 'Brillouin optical time domain analysis', 'non-local effects', 'Brillouin threshold', 'optical fiber sensors', 'stimulated Brillouin scattering']"

"We compare the energy consumption of digital optical and digital electronic signal processing circuits, including the contributions to energy consumption of the optical to electrical (O/E) converters and electrical to optical (E/O) converters, and the demultiplexers (DEMUXs) and multiplexers (MUXs) required for electronic circuits to process high-speed optical signals. This paper focuses on three key practical considerations, namely, energy consumption, energy density, and the complexity of processing. We show that optical signal processing is potentially competitive with electronics in very high-speed circuits that provide only limited processing, i.e., when only a small number of processing operations are performed on each bit of data. However, in applications that require anything more than limited processing, electronics provides better energy efficiency and occupies a smaller footprint. In these applications, electronics is likely to remain the technology of choice. More attention needs to be paid to energy consumption issues in the research and development of new digital optical technologies.",[],[]

"A multiband bandpass microwave photonic filter (MPF) whose passband number and position can be selected is theoretically analyzed and experimentally demonstrated. The proposed MPF is based on a wide-band optical source (WBOS) and a two-order high-birefringence fiber loop mirror (HB-FLM), which serves as a slicing filter. Two segments of high-birefringence fiber (HBF) with the lengths of 3 m and 6 m are used in the HB-FLM, and three typical spectral periods or their combinations can be independently achieved by simply adjusting the polarization controllers (PCs) in the HB-FLM. Subsequently, the light source is sliced with uniform or mixing wavelength spacing. A coil of single-mode fiber (SMF) is then used to act as a dispersive medium to introduce time delay between taps. Thus, a single or multiband bandpass response is obtained at the output of a high-speed photodetector (PD). In addition, the passband centered at dc frequency is removed due to the use of phase modulation.

"A scheme to realize a high linear analog photonic link based on a dual-parallel Mach–Zehnder modulator (DPMZM) is proposed and demonstrated in this paper. By using only two electrical phase shifters with \pi phase shift and optimizing the biases of the DPMZM, the third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3) is completely eliminated by taking all the sidebands in the optical spectrum that produce IMD3 into consideration in theory. Without digital linearization, other optical processers, and symmetrical single-sideband modulation, optical carrier suppression (OCS) is achieved in one of the submodulators of DPMZM, which guarantees the effectiveness of information transmission. Quadrature modulation is achieved in the other submodulator of DPMZM, and the electrical signals on the two electrodes are the same, which result in a simple operation.

An optical fiber thermal anemometer is proposed based on a silver film-coated fiber Bragg grating (FBG) assisted by a core offset fusion splice.

"We report experimental observations and numerical simulation results on the spectrum moving, narrowing, broadening, and wavelength switching of dissipative solitons (DSs) in an all-normal-dispersion Yb-fiber laser that is passively mode-locked by using the nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) technique. We found numerically that the DS spectrum moving, together with spectrum narrowing/broadening, is caused by the effective gain profile change resulted from the moving of the artificial spectral filter. Furthermore, we show that the wavelength switching observed in the laser is a natural consequence of the effective gain switching. The moving of the artificial spectral filter could be originated from either the cavity birefringence change or the polarizer rotation. Due to the broad gain and the artificial birefringent filter introduced by the NPR technique, apart from the central wavelength shifting and bandwidth changing, wavelength switching of DSs could be obtained by simply rotating the polarizer. Numerical simulations well reproduced the experimental observations. Our results suggest that extra effort should be made for wavelength tuning if there is any polarization-dependent component in the cavity as the wavelength switching will interrupt the continuously wavelength shift.","['Optical fiber polarization', 'Band-pass filters', 'Optical fiber dispersion', 'Laser mode locking', 'Cavity resonators', 'Bandwidth', 'Tuning']","['Spectrum moving', 'wavelength switching', 'dissipative soliton', 'fiber lasers', 'all-normal-dispersion']"

"Phase modulation is one of the key functionalities in an integrated photonics circuit. In the silicon photonics platform, several approaches have been undertaken. The thermooptic effect is slow and relatively power hungry, whereas a carrier-based approach is fast ( > Gb/s) but lossy and weak. Integration of other (e.g., electrooptic) materials typically struggles with fabrication issues that limit the effect. Here, we present a nanoelectromechanical systems-based approach. By applying a voltage over a freestanding slot waveguide, the slot width will change, resulting in an effective index change and thus a phase change. Using a cascaded structure, the effect can be enlarged without reducing the speed. A phase change of 40 ^{\circ} was observed for a voltage of 13 V over a cascade of three 5.8- \mu\hbox{m} -long freestanding slots.

"We present a timing jitter and amplitude noise characterization of a high-power mode-locked integrated external-cavity surface emitting laser (MIXSEL). In the MIXSEL, the semiconductor saturable absorber of a SESAM is integrated into the structure of a VECSEL to start and stabilize passive mode-locking. In comparison to previous noise characterization of SESAM-mode-locked VECSELs, this first noise characterization of a MIXSEL is performed at a much higher average output power. In a free-running operation, the laser generates 14.3-ps pulses at an average output power of 645 mW at a 2-GHz pulse repetition rate and an RMS amplitude noise of 0.15% [1 Hz, 10 MHz]. We measured an RMS timing jitter of 129 fs [100 Hz, 10 MHz], which represents the lowest value for a free-running passively mode-locked semiconductor disk laser to date. Additionally, we stabilized the pulse repetition rate with a piezo actuator to control the cavity length. With the laser generating 16.7-ps pulses at an average output power of 701 mW, the repetition frequency was phase-locked to a low-noise electronic reference using a feedback loop. In actively stabilized operation, the RMS timing jitter was reduced to less than 70 fs [1 Hz, 100 MHz]. In the 100-Hz to 10-MHz bandwidth, we report the lowest timing jitter measured from a passively mode-locked semiconductor disk laser to date with a value of 31 fs.

"Reflection and transmission modes are studied in a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor, where a nanohole-array-patterned gold film is deposited on a glass substrate, and the analyte in an aqueous medium is bound onto the patterned gold film. The reflection (transmission) mode means that light illuminates the structure from the analyte (substrate) side, and the detection is fixed at the analyte side. The two modes are studied by calculating absorption (and transmission) spectra and optical field distributions of the sensor. This study shows that both modes can excite the SPR on the analyte/gold interface, which is useful for sensing. However, the optical field distribution at the resonant wavelength is different for the two modes, and the effect is dependent on the gold film thickness. Comparing the sensing performance, the reflection mode gives larger resonant optical field enhancements (32 as compared with 22), but the transmission mode uses much thinner gold films (60 nm as compared with 150 nm).

"A directional coupler structure formed by a nematic liquid crystal (NLC)-filled photonic crystal fiber (PCF) represents a promising configuration in sensing applications. Because of large refractive index difference between the NLC and silica material, the mode coupling between the NLC waveguide and the silica core is more complicated than the situation of coupling between two fundamental modes of the waveguides.

In this paper, we present a thorough analysis, both theoretically and experimentally, of the directional coupler structure, including the mode properties, coupling characteristics, and thermal sensing properties. The temperature response of the device is experimentally measured, showing a polynomial curve in nematic phase and a linear curve in isotropic phase. The nonlinearity of the temperature response of the device in nematic phase and the linearity in isotropic phase are attributed to the temperature dependence of the refractive index of the NLC.

With net-normal dispersion, the experimental laser, operating in a dissipative soliton resonance region, generates stable rectangular pulses. The pulsewidth varies from 480 ps to 6.19 ns with the increasing pump power, and its center wavelength has a 28.95-nm tunable range (from 1940.22 to 1969.17 nm) by properly adjusting the polarization controllers. The maximum of average output power and pulse energy is 60.73 mW and 19.51 nJ, respectively. The rectangular pulses have a clamped peak power of about 3.16 W.

"We present the design and experimental demonstration of a contra-directional grating-coupled racetrack resonator exhibiting the Vernier effect. The device consists of two racetrack resonators that are coupled together in a cascaded configuration. The input coupler in each racetrack resonator of the cascaded configuration consists of contra-directional gratings. The benefit of using contra-directional couplers is their small bandwidth, as compared to co-directional couplers that do not have gratings. The simulation results show that this device provides numerous performance advantages compared to cascaded racetrack resonators exhibiting the Vernier effect without contra-directional grating couplers. Specifically, we eliminate the free spectral range (FSR, i.e., in both the drop port and the through port) and show substantial improvement in the interstitial peak suppression and the through port insertion loss for the cascaded racetrack resonator with gratings, as compared to the case without gratings. In addition, experimental results are presented, which show an interstitial peak suppression of 29.3 dB, as well as the elimination of the FSR in the drop port and the through port.","['Gratings', 'Couplers', 'Couplings', 'Optical waveguides', 'Ports (Computers)', 'Optical ring resonators']","['Silicon nanophotonics', 'gratings', 'waveguide devices']"
"In this paper, we report a novel fiber-optic Fabry-Perot interferometric (FFPI) temperature sensor based on the difference of thermal expansion coefficient between fused silica and metallic materials. The sensor head is made by a single-mode fiber (SMF). A gold film and a nickel film are sputtered and electroplated on the surface of the SMF. Then, a microcavity is micromachined by focused ion beam (FIB) milling. Because the thermal expansion coefficient of nickel is about 20 times of fused silica, the different thermal expansions force the sensor head to bend when the temperature is high or low. Its temperature sensitivity is over 14 pm/°C in a wide range from -79°C to +70°C. And the coefficient of determination R 2 is excellent (over 0.995). Moreover, the metallic cylinder can reinforce the cavity spot of the fiber sensor, so that this kind of sensor can work in harsh environments. For the first time to the best of our knowledge, we report this type of FFPI temperature sensor based on difference of thermal expansion coefficient between fused silica and metallic materials.","['Temperature sensors', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Cavity resonators', 'Temperature measurement', 'Optical fibers', 'Silicon compounds', 'Thermal expansion']","['Fabry–Perot interferometric (FFPI)', 'fiber sensor', 'thermal expansion coefficient', 'focused ion beam milling']"
"A pumping-power-dependent high-order harmonic mode-locking erbium-doped fiber laser (HML-EDFL) with a single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-doped polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based saturable absorber is investigated. The HML-EDFL systems using either all-physical-contact (PC) or all-angled-physical-contact (APC) connectors examined in this study show stably mode-locked pulse trains; however, the all-PC connector-based system requires a larger pumping power to initiate the mode-locking and generate a broader pulsewidth of 2.9–5.2 ps at same HML order. The all-APC connector-based HML-EDFL system can provide pulsewidth shortening from 3.8 to 1.9 ps associated with a spectral linewidth broadened from 0.7 to 1.36 nm by increasing the HML order from first to sixth. Either the all-PC or the all-APC connector-based EDFLs can deliver a nearly transform-limited pulse with a time–bandwidth product (TBP) of 0.32. The EDFL passively mode-locked by SWCNT-doped PVA delivers a pulse train with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) remaining higher than 40 dB for different HML orders, whereas the side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) lower than 32 dB inevitably introduces an unequalized peak amplitude phenomenon for adjacent pulses at higher HML operations. A modified Haus' master equation is derived to explain the inverse proportionality of the passive HML-EDFL pulsewidth to the square root of HML order, which is correlated with the shortened carrier recombination time of the SWCNT saturable absorber at higher pumping power or circulating pulse intensity.","['Connectors', 'Cavity resonators', 'Laser mode locking', 'Erbium-doped fiber lasers', 'Carbon nanotubes', 'Pump lasers']","['Carbon nanotubes and confined systems', 'mode-locked lasers', 'erbium lasers', 'fiber lasers']"

Coarse and fine tunability of the MMW and THz signals from 117 to 954 GHz is also demonstrated by injecting the external light into different residual modes of the QD laser and by controlling the injection strength and the initial frequency detuning.","['Optical attenuators', 'Laser modes', 'Optical mixing', 'Optical reflection', 'Quantum dot lasers']","['Semiconductor lasers', 'quantum dot lasers', 'millimeter-wave', 'THz', 'signal generation']"

"Quarter-wave operation or a phase shift of more than π/2, which is approximately ten times greater than that reported in previous works using liquid crystals (LCs) and graphene electrodes, was demonstrated. The device is transparent to the terahertz (THz) wave, and the driving voltage required was as low as approximately 2.2 V (rms), which is also unprecedented. Experimental results supported a theoretical formalism adapted for LC cells with THz wavelength-scale thickness. The scattering rate, DC mobility, and carrier mean free path of bilayer graphene were also determined using THz spectroscopic techniques; the parameters were inferior to those of monolayer graphene. This observation can be attributed to the higher density of charged impurities in the bilayer graphene.

"This paper mainly focuses on efficient schemes for simulating propagation in optical fibers. Various schemes based on split-step Fourier techniques to solve the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE), which describes the propagation in optical fibers, are compared. In general, the schemes in which the loss operator is combined with nonlinearity operator are found to be more computationally efficient than the schemes in which the loss is combined with dispersion. When the global error is large, the schemes with variable step size outperform the ones with uniform step size. The schemes based on local error and/or minimum area mismatch (MAM) further improve the computational efficiency. In this scheme, by minimizing the area mismatch between the exponential profile and its stepwise approximation, an optimal step size distribution is found. The optimization problem is solved by the steepest descent algorithm. The number of steps to get the desired accuracy is determined by the local error method. The proposed scheme is found to have higher computational efficiency than the other schemes studied in this paper. For QPSK systems, when the global error is10−8, the number of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) needed for the conventional scheme (loss combined with dispersion and uniform step size) is 5.8 times that of the proposed scheme.

"The high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) degrades the performance in optical wireless communication systems. This paper proposes a modified asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) with low PAPR via introducing a recoverable upper-clipping (RoC) procedure. Although some information is clipped by a predetermined peak threshold, the clipped error information is kept and repositioned in our proposed scheme, which is named RoC-ACO-OFDM, instead of simply being dropped in conventional schemes. The proposed method makes full use of the specific structure of ACO-OFDM signals in the time domain, where half of the positions are forced to zeros within an OFDM symbol. The zero-valued positions are utilized to carry the clipped error information. Moreover, we accordingly present an optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection for the RoC-ACO-OFDM system. To facilitate the usage of RoC-ACO-OFDM in practical applications, an efficient detection method is further developed with near-optimal performance.

By detailedly analyzing the profiles of energy band diagrams, distributions of carrier concentration, and electron current density, the advantages of Al-content graded Al x Ga 1-x N EBL are attributed to the resulting lower resistivity, higher barrier for electron leakage, and simultaneously reduced barrier for hole injection compared with the conventional EBL with constant Al composition.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Aluminum gallium nitride', 'Charge carrier processes', 'III-V semiconductor materials', 'Gallium nitride', 'Electric potential']","['III-Nitride', 'graded AlGaN electron blocking layer', 'ultraviolet light-emitting diodes']"

"We proposed and experimentally demonstrated a wavelength-space division multiplexing (WSDM) optical access network architecture with centralized optical carrier delivery utilizing multicore fibers (MCFs) and adaptive modulation based on reflective semiconductor amplifier (RSOA). In our experiment, five of the outer cores are used for undirectional downstream (DS) transmission only, whereas the remaining outer core is utilized as a dedicated channel to transmit upstream (US) signals. Optical carriers for US are delivered from the optical line terminal (OLT) to the optical network unit (ONU) via the inner core and then transmitted back to the OLT after amplification and modulation by the RSOA in the colorless ONU side. The mobile backhaul (MB) service is also supported by the inner core. Wavelengths used in US transmission should be different from that of the MB in order to avoid the Rayleigh backscattering effect in bidirectional transmission. With quadrature phase-shift keying--orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (QPSK-OFDM) modulation format, the aggregation DS capacity reaches 250 Gb/s using five outer cores and ten wavelengths, and it can be further scaled to 1 Tb/s using 20 wavelengths modulated with 16 QAM-OFDM. For US transmission, 2.5 Gb/s QPSK-OFDM transmission can be achieved just using a low-bandwidth RSOA, and adaptive modulation is applied to the RSOA to further enhance the US data rate to 3.12 Gb/s. As an emulation of high-speed MB transmission, 48 Gb/s in-phase and quadrature (IQ) modulated popularization division multiplexing (PDM)-QPSK signal is transmitted in the inner core of MCF and coherently detected in the OLT side.

The different regimes that occur as the reverse bias voltage applied to the saturable absorber (SA) section or the bias current injected into the amplifier section are characterized both in the time and frequency/wavelength domains. Our results reveal that the lasers display spectral competition between the gain of the amplifier section and the absorption of the SA, with variations of the lasing wavelength up to 25 nm as the bias conditions are changed. These wavelength variations result from the thermal drift of the SA band-edge due to Joule heating by the generated photocurrent and from the competition between two possible lasing regions placed either at the amplifier gain peak or near the band-edge of the SA.

"This paper demonstrates a flexible bandwidth-modulation-capable and bandwidth scalable transmitter and receiver technique based on dynamic optical arbitrary waveform generation (OAWG) and measurement (OAWM). This technique generates and receives broadband arbitrary optical waveforms by dividing the waveform spectrum into overlapping spectral slices of bandwidth manageable with existing electronics. The OAWG transmitter produced 2-ns, 60-GHz data waveforms using only 5.5 GHz of analog bandwidth by coherently combining six 10-GHz spectral slices. Measurements were performed using an OAWM receiver with two 30-GHz spectral slices using 15 GHz of analog bandwidth. Experimental demonstrations verify the modulation format independence and flexible bandwidth capabilities of OAWG transmitters and OAWM receivers through the generation of the following waveforms: binary phase-shifted keying (BPSK), coherent wavelength division multiplexing (CoWDM) with 5 and 15 BPSK subcarriers, and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with 54 BPSK subcarriers.

"Transmission of light through periodic metal films with intensity considerably exceeding that predicted by aperture theory is referred to as extraordinary optical transmission (EOT). The mechanisms responsible for this effect have been investigated intensively during the past decade. Here, we show an elegant method of visualizing the operative physical mechanisms for model resonance systems. By numerically mapping the resonance loci, modal and plasmonic mechanisms emerge clearly with delineated regions of dominance. Thus, the photonic transmission resonances are parametrically correlated with localized electromagnetic fields forming pure surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs), coexisting plasmonic and cavity-mode (CM) states, and pure CMs. This mapping method renders a consistent picture of the transitions between photonic states in terms of key parameters. It shows how the TM 1 CM seamlessly morphs into the odd SPP mode as the film thickness diminishes. Similarly, the TM 0 mode converts to the even SPP mode. At the intersection of these mode curves, an EOT-free gap forms due to their interaction. On account of a reflection phase shift of a slit-guided mode, an abrupt transition of the resonance loci in the SPP/CM region is observed.","['Dispersion', 'Metals', 'Resonant frequency', 'Cavity resonators', 'Optical films', 'Optical reflection']","['Plasmonics', 'subwavelength structures', 'waveguides', 'gratings', 'nanocavities', 'optical properties of photonic materials']"

"This paper reports fabrication, characterization, and testing of the thermal stability of ZnO-based Schottky ultraviolet photodetectors. The ZnO thin film was grown on a p-type Si 〈100〉 substrate by the sol-gel technique. The surface morphological and the structural properties of the thin film were studied by an atomic force microscope (AFM) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). For the investigation of the surface chemical bonding, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were also performed. The I - V characteristics of the Schottky barrier photodetector were studied, and the parameters such as ideality factor, leakage current, and barrier height were extracted from the measured data at room temperature. With applied bias voltages in the range from -3 to 3 V, the contrast ratio, responsivity, detectivity, and quantum efficiency of the photodetectors were measured for an incident optical power of 0.1 mW at 365-nm wavelength. The electrical and optical study revealed that the performance of the device improves with increasing post metal deposition annealing temperature up to 100°C. The device exhibited excellent thermal stability in the annealing temperature range of 100°C to 200°C. For annealing temperatures beyond 200°C, the performance of the device degrades drastically. It was also found that at under 200°C, there is a harmonious correlation between the photoresponse and electrical characteristics of the device. Above this temperature, there is no correlation between the variations of photoresponse and electrical characteristics with increasing annealing temperature.

We demonstrate use of the beam propagation method (BPM) to analyze beam distortion in GRIN-lensed fibers resulting from index profiles that exhibit a deviation from the ideal parabolic shape or artifacts such as ripples or a central dip. Furthermore, we demonstrate the power of this method for exploring novel probe designs that incorporate GRIN phase masks to generate wavefront-shaped output beams with extended depth-of-focus (DOF). We present results using our method that are in good agreement with experimental data. The BPM enables accurate simulation of fiber probes using non-ideal or custom-engineered GRIN fibers with arbitrary refractive index profiles, which is important in the design of high-performance fiber-based micro-imaging systems for biomedical applications.","['Probes', 'Indexes', 'Refractive index', 'Lenses', 'Numerical models', 'Optical imaging', 'Optical sensors']","['Biomedical optical imaging', 'optical microscopy']"

"During the indoor visible light communication (VLC) channel modeling procedure, the transmitter constituted by an array of light-emitting diodes (LED's) is frequently modeled as a single point source for convenience. However, how accurate this simplified treatment is remains unanswered. This paper compares the channel characteristics of both the simplified point-source model and six practical cases having various numbers of LEDs. Our numerical results show that the deviations in terms of the channel's optical path loss (OPL), as well as its bandwidth and the channel's delay spread, are steadily increased upon increasing the number of LEDs of each transmitter, until LEDs spread almost over the entire ceiling. Even in the worst case, the deviation of the OPL remains below 0.41 dBo, whereas that of the 3-dB transmission bandwidth is below 1.67 MHz. However, the deviation in terms of the root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread can reach 1.88 ns.

"A bilayered-twisted Fermat's spiral chiral metamaterial (FSCMM) is proposed for the realization of circular polarization of far-infrared waves and polarization filters. It is demonstrated through full-wave simulations that the proposed FSCMM can convert waves from linear to circular polarization (CP) around 2.5 THz. The reported FSCMM is sensitive to the handedness of circularly polarized light, where it can filter out either righthanded or left-handed CP light with an optical isolation of 35 dB around 2.5 THz. The proposed FSCMM is compact with a dimension of λ/4 × λ/4 × λ/9 at the far-infrared operating waveband. The CP conversion and filtering functionalities of the proposed FSCMM are ensured for oblique incidences up to 200 with an optical isolation of more than 25 dB for both xand y-oriented linear polarized excitations. The operation bandwidth of the proposed system is enhanced in the level of 0.058 THz to 0.11 THz for twoand three-unit-cell composite systems, respectively.

Attosecond pulses are now available in many different labs with additional gating techniques which somewhat relax the requirements for the pulse duration of the intense infrared laser pulses.

"We consider the design of photonic circuits that make use of Ti:LiNbO 3 diffused channel waveguides to generate photons with various combinations of modal, spectral, and polarization entanglement. Down-converted photon pairs are generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a two-mode waveguide (TMW). We study a class of photonic circuits comprising: 1) a nonlinear periodically poled TMW structure; 2) a set of single-mode waveguide (SMW)- and TMW-based couplers arranged in such a way that they suitably separate the three photons comprising the SPDC process; and, for some applications, 3) a holographic Bragg grating that acts as a dichroic reflector. The first circuit produces two frequency-degenerate down-converted photons, each with even spatial parity, in two separate SMWs. Changing the parameters of the elements allows this same circuit to produce two nondegenerate down-converted photons that are entangled in frequency or simultaneously entangled in frequency and polarization. The second photonic circuit is designed to produce modal entanglement by distinguishing the photons on the basis of their frequencies. A modified version of this circuit can be used to generate photons that are doubly entangled in mode number and polarization. The third photonic circuit is designed to manage dispersion by converting modal, spectral, and polarization entanglement into path entanglement.","['Circuits', 'Optical waveguides', 'Photonics', 'Frequency', 'Optical polarization', 'Quantum computing', 'Holography', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Optical computing', 'Holographic optical components']","['Photonic circuits', 'integrated-optics devices', 'channel waveguides', 'waveguide couplers', 'parametric down-conversion', 'quantum optics', 'nonlinear optics', 'entangled photons', 'dispersion management']"
"We report a photonic approach to generating radio-frequency (RF) waveforms based on a dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator (DPMZM) driven by a sinusoidal RF signal. One of the sub-MZMs (MZM1) of the DPMZM is driven by the sinusoidal RF signal, whereas the other sub-MZM (MZM2) has no driven signal. In this way, the powers of even- and odd-order sidebands can be separately controlled by adjusting the bias of the MZM1. The power ratio between the odd- (or even-) order sidebands is tunable by adjusting the RF power. Moreover, the power and the phase of the optical carrier can be independently tunable by adjusting the biases of the MZM2 and the parent MZM of the DPMZM, respectively. After detecting by a photodetector, an RF signal with controllable harmonics is generated. Thus, a desired RF waveform can be generated by separately manipulating its harmonics. The proposed method is theoretically analyzed. In addition, proof-of-concept experiments are carried out to generate triangular and rectangular waveforms with repetition rates of 5 and 10 GHz.","['Radio frequency', 'Optical filters', 'Harmonic analysis', 'Amplitude modulation', 'Power harmonic filters', 'Optical fibers']","['Radio-frequency waveform generation', 'dual-parallel Mach–Zehnder modulator']"

"We propose a novel scheme for quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulated vector signal generation based on photonic heterodyne beating, phase precoding, and optical carrier suppression (OCS). Different from our previous OCS-based vector signal generation schemes, in our proposed scheme, the precoded vector signal at the radio-frequency (RF) band, which is used for the drive of the intensity modulator operating at its OCS point, is generated by photonic heterodyning beating rather than a single digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Photonic heterodyne beating accomplishes the upconversion of the precoded vector signal from the baseband to the RF band, and thus, the DAC in our proposed scheme is used to generate the precoded vector signal at the baseband rather than that at the RF band, which significantly reduces the DAC bandwidth requirement. We experimentally demonstrate 17.6-GHz QPSK modulated vector signal generation based on our proposed scheme. The generated 17.6-GHz vector signal can carry up to 3-GBd QPSK data with a bit error ratio (BER) less than the hard-decision forward-error-correction (HD-FEC) threshold of3.8×10−3.","['Photonics', 'Phase shift keying', 'Optical modulation', 'Bandwidth', 'Frequency modulation', 'Optical mixing']","['Photonic vector signal generation', 'photonic heterodyne beating', 'phase precoding', 'optical carrier suppression (OCS)', 'quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)']"

We use a fiber-coupled multimode 808-nm pump diode, which is mounted inside the laser housing. No active cavity length stabilization is employed. The phase noise of the free-running laser integrated over a bandwidth from 100 Hz to 1 MHz corresponds to an RMS timing jitter of ≈212 fs, which is lower than previously obtained for mode-locked VECSELs. This clearly confirms the superior noise performance expected from a high-Q-cavity semiconductor laser.

"The optical carrier generation is the basic building block to implement all-optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission. One method to optically generate single and multicarriers is to use the microring resonator (MRR). The MRRs can be used as filter devices, where generation of high-frequency (GHz) soliton signals as single and multicarriers can be performed using suitable system parameters. Here, the optical soliton in a nonlinear fiber MRR system is analyzed, using a modified add/drop system known as a Panda ring resonator connected to an add/drop system. In order to set up a transmission system, i.e., IEEE802.11a, first, 64 uniform optical carriers were generated and separated by a splitter and modulated; afterward, the spectra of the modulated optical subcarriers are overlapped, which results one optical OFDM channel band. The quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and 16-QAM are used for modulating the subcarriers. The generated OFDM signal is multiplexed with a single-carrier soliton and transmitted through the single-mode fiber (SMF). After photodetection, the radio frequency (RF) signal was propagated. On the receiver side, the RF signal was optically modulated and processed. The results show the generation of 64 multicarriers evenly spaced in the range from 54.09 to 55.01 GHz, where demodulation of these signals is performed, and the performance of the system is analyzed.","['Optical ring resonators', 'OFDM', 'Optical solitons', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Optical filters', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical transmitters']","['Panda ring resonator', 'soliton carriers', 'IEEE802.11a', 'OFDM']"

"Precise and secure time synchronization between two remote sites is necessary in many practical scenarios. Recently, the two-way fiber time transfer (TWFTT) system has become an attractive option for high-precision time synchronization. However, TWFTT is implemented based on symmetric link assumption, and such assumption may be maliciously utilized to cause significant time asynchronization to TWFTT. In this paper, we propose two novel controllable asymmetry attack schemes for TWFTT, namely, the link asymmetry attack and the attenuation asymmetry attack. We theoretically analyze the controllability and the effectiveness of these two attacks. Experimental results show that our link asymmetry attack can introduce 2.49 ns time offset per asymmetric link length (in meters), and our attenuation asymmetry attack can introduce at most 36.6 times time offset (compared to normal situation) when the attenuation is 45.3%.

"Integrated optical affinity sensors based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) enable sensitive and label-free detection of chemical and biological molecules.

Moreover, the direction of phase change cannot be unambiguously determined with these sensors. Here, we present a coherent detection scheme based on integrated optics that enables unambiguous readout of the optical phase with a constant sensitivity. Our approach furthermore cancels the effect of imperfections in the sensor hardware using a blind calibration scheme.

"By controlling the polarization state of a simple ring erbium-doped fiber laser with photonics crystal fiber, polarization controller (PC) and tunable band-pass filter, this paper demonstrates stable operation of narrow spacing dual-wavelength fiber laser (DWFL). The flexibility of the tunable band-pass filter and PC allows the spacing tuning of the DWFL from 80 pm up to 600 pm. Such tuning ability offers flexibility in the application of DWFL, particularly in tunable microwave generation and radio over fiber. Throughout the experiment, the DWFL shows high power stability within 0.6 dB and wavelength shift of less than 10 pm. In addition to that, it also produces a narrow linewidth optical output of 3 pm with a high signal to noise ratio of more than 60 dB.","['Optical fiber polarization', 'Erbium-doped fiber lasers', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Laser tuning', 'Measurement by laser beam']","['Dual-wavelength', 'erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL)', 'narrow spacing', 'polarization dependent loss (PDL)']"

"A very electrically small, active open cylindrical coated nanoparticle model is constructed, and its electromagnetic properties are investigated in the visible frequency band. Its optical response under both planewave and electric dipole antenna excitations shows very strong dipole behavior at its lowest resonance frequency. The scattering cross section at that dipole resonance frequency is increased by more than +50 dBsm for the planewave excitation. When the open structure is excited by a small current (I0 = 1 ×10 -3 A) driven dipole antenna, the maximum radiated power of the composite nanoantenna can be increased by +83.35 dB over its value obtained when the dipole antenna radiates alone in free space. The behaviors under various locations and orientations of the dipole are explored. Dipole orientations along the cylinder axis and symmetric locations of the dipole produced the largest radiated power enhancements.","['Nanobioscience', 'Resonant frequency', 'Materials', 'Permittivity', 'Metals', 'Optical scattering']","['Electrically small antennas', 'metamaterials', 'nanoantenna', 'nanostructures', 'plasmonics', 'radiation', 'scattering']"

Thanks to the wide bandwidth of the PM, high-speed phase modulation of the microwave pulse can be realized.

"Metamaterial-based perfect absorbers have attracted considerable attention due to their potential for practical applications. The existing absorbers, however, are mostly polarization insensitive or only sensitive to one direction, which is inapplicable in some areas. Polarization tunable or high absorption in two orthogonal directions is very useful and necessary. Herein, we present a polarization tunable absorber formed by an asymmetric patch and a dielectric layer on top of a metallic board. With this structure, the frequency of the absorber can be tuned by merely changing the polarization of the incident. The tunable mechanism originates from the different length of the patch along the two orthogonal directions. The concept is rather general and applicable to various absorbers, as long as the asymmetric design is valid. The absorber can find practical applications in manipulation of the polarization of the light and detecting waves with specific polarization.","['Absorption', 'Broadband communication', 'Dual band', 'Metamaterials', 'Dielectrics', 'Magnetic resonance']","['Metamaterial', 'perfect absorber', 'polarization tunable', 'terahertz']"
"The design of a new graphene-based continuously tunable optical delay line formed by two vertically stacked microring resonators coupled to a straight waveguide is proposed. High values of delay time (τ g = 360 ps) and a wide tuning range (Δτ g = 230 ps) have been calculated, due to the graphene sandwiched between the stacked ring resonators, which also provides an electrooptical tuning of the delay with low energy consumption (E switch = 3.4 pJ) and fast switching time (t switch <; 2 ns). The ratio Δrg/A represents an important figure of merit (FOM) for optical delay lines. A value FOM = 1.4 × 10 -1 ps/μm 2 has been calculated, which corresponds to an enhancement of about a factor 4 compared with the state-of-the-art of the integrated optical delay lines, also providing a switching time several times faster. Such performance, together with a small device footprint (<; 1.6 × 10 3 μm 2 ), gives a significant contribution to the state-of-the-art of optical delay lines, confirming the suitability of the graphene-based resonant cavity as a high-efficient optical delay line for applications in which fast tuning and wide range of tunability are required, e.g., phased array antennas.","['Nanomaterials', 'Graphene', 'Cavity resonators', 'Delay lines', 'Optical buffering', 'Optical waveguides', 'Integrated optics']","['Integrated optics devices', 'Coupled resonators', 'Nanomaterials']"

"This paper introduces a method of measuring the delta between the effective refractive index of a silicon waveguide and a waveguide with wider dimensions through the constructive and destructive interference in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The method consists of a fixed effective refractive index variation incorporated by tapering one of the arms in the interferometer to a wider waveguide dimension. The MZI consists of a Y-branch splitter and a multimode interference (MMI) coupler. The Y-branch splitter splits the input light 50/50 into the two arms, and the MMI is used for recombination of the two arms. A change in the effective refractive index of one arm in comparison with the other arm in the interferometer will introduce a phase difference on recombination in the MMI. The MMI has the following three ports: the top and bottom output ports, which are the antisymmetric outputs, and the middle port, which is the symmetric output. When the two signals are in phase, all the light is coupled into the symmetric port, and when the two inputs are π out of phase, the light is coupled 50/50 into the antisymmetric ports.

"A novel photonic approach to generating a frequency-quadrupled millimeter-wave (mm-wave) signal with a tunable phase shift is proposed and demonstrated. Two second-order optical sidebands are generated by using a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) that is biased at the maximum transmission point and an optical notch filter. A polarization-maintaining fiber Bragg grating (PM-FBG) is then utilized to make the two sidebands orthogonally polarized, which are then sent to a polarization modulator (PolM). By aligning the two orthogonally polarized sidebands with the two principal axes of the PolM, complementary phase modulation is thus achieved. By beating the two phase-modulated sidebands at a photodetector, an mm-wave signal is generated and its phase is continuously tunable by tuning the bias voltage to the PolM. An experiment is performed. An mm-wave signal with a frequency tunable from 36 to 52 GHz is generated and its phase is tunable over 360 ° by tuning the bias voltage.","['Amplitude modulation', 'Optical polarization', 'Optical filters', 'Microwave photonics', 'Microwave filters', 'Optical fibers']","['Microwave photonics', 'mm-wave signal generation', 'phase-array beamforming', 'tunable phase shift']"
"Hybrid free-space optical (FSO)/radio-frequency (RF) systems have emerged as a promising solution for high-data-rate wireless communications. In this paper, we consider power adaptation strategies based on truncated channel inversion for the hybrid FSO/RF system employing adaptive combining. Specifically, we adaptively set the RF link transmission power when FSO link quality is unacceptable to ensure constant combined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. Two adaptation strategies are proposed. One strategy depends on the received RF SNR, whereas the other one depends on the combined SNR of both links. Analytical expressions for the outage probability of the hybrid system with and without power adaptation are obtained. Numerical examples show that the hybrid FSO/RF system with power adaptation achieves a considerable outage performance improvement over the conventional system.","['Radio frequency', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Hybrid power systems', 'Atmospheric modeling', 'Adaptive optics', 'Optical receivers']","['Hybrid FSO/RF', 'Gamma-Gamma atmospheric turbulence model', 'Pointing errors', 'Nakagami-m fading model', 'Outage probability', 'MRC combining', 'Power adaptation']"

"It has been widely recognized that the underlying principles of quantum mechanics could be used to enable secure communications, without any additional conventional cryptographic systems, while utilizing the properties of the photons. Considerable research efforts have been invested to develop an efficient quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme over either free-space optical or fiber-optics channels. Most of these research efforts have been focused on a two-dimensional QKD, commonly realized by the use of the polarization state of photons. However, the data rates for the quantum key exchange in two-dimensional QKD are still low, while transmission distance is limited. On the other hand, it is well known that photons can carry both the spin angular momentum (SAM) and the orbital angular momentum (OAM), associated with the polarization and azimuthal phase of the complex electric field, respectively. Accordingly, we can define the combined-OAM-SAM state of a photon as |l, σ〉, where l and σ correspond to OAM and SAM indexes, respectively. Since the OAM eigenstates are orthogonal, an arbitrary number of bits per single photon can be transmitted, which could considerably increase the total secure bit rate. To improve secure data rates, we propose two types of protocols, namely, nonentangled-based (such as weak coherent state) and entanglement-assisted protocols, both employing the photon combined-OAM-SAM state, which can be used for secure key distribution over free-space optical and few-mode fiber channels. Two types of entanglement-assisted protocols are described, namely, two-basis and (D + 1)-basis protocols ( D is dimensionality of corresponding Hilbert space). We further describe how to implement the qudit gates required for implementation of these protocols.

Excellent agreements between numerical simulations and real-time experimental measurements are obtained over a wide diversity of transmission conditions of the aforementioned systems. The physical mechanism underpinning the occurrence of negative power penalties is the reduction in subcarrier intermixing impairment due to the compensation between DML positive frequency chirps and MetroCor negative chromatic dispersions.

Results show scotopic/photopic (S/P) ratios>3.80 and color rendering indices (CRIs)≥70 for three-hump LEDs and S/P ratios>3.90 and CRIs≥70 for four-hump LEDs under a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 45 000 K. Furthermore, for both three- and four-hump LEDs under the condition of CCT>5000 K, optimal results in this paper exhibit capabilities of exceedingS/P=2.50and simultaneously satisfying the criterion of CRI≥70. Our simulation procedure is conducted under variations of nine CCTs, several wavelengths, and peak heights. Optimized results of S/P ratios and CRIs are identified and retained through filtering off a great number of unqualified candidates. Finally, present findings may help improve the quality of eye visions pertaining to LED illumination and help reduce the electrical energy consumption related to LED usage.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Color', 'Rendering (computer graphics)', 'Filtering', 'Indexes', 'Light sources', 'Market research']","['Solid-state lighting', 'light-emitting diodes', 'scotopic/photopic ratios', 'color rendering index', 'luminous efficacy of radiation']"

"We demonstrated the dual-wavelength simultaneously Q-switched Nd: Lu 2 O 3 laser with a topological insulator Bi 2 Se 3 as the Q-switcher. The continuous-wave Nd:Lu 2 O 3 crystal laser with the slope efficiency of 31% was achieved, and the first Nd:Lu 2 O 3 pulsed laser operation was reported, as far as we know. By using the wavelength-insensitive saturable absorption of topological insulators, the dual wavelength of the Nd:Lu 2 O 3 crystal laser can be Q-switched simultaneously without the frequency selection of the saturable absorber, since the emission cross-sections of Nd:Lu 2 O 3 at the wavelengths of 1077 and 1081 nm are comparable. The results indicate that the topological insulator is wavelength-insensitive and should be suitable for the dual-wavelength simultaneously Q-switched laser as a passive Q-switcher.

In light of the upcoming launch of 5G services, this paper aims to evaluate the performance of the FSO system for the implementation of 5G technology in diverse geographical locations of India. The proposed 16 × 10Gbpswavelength division multiplexing (WDM) based FSO link uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and digital signal processing (DSP) module to mitigate channel-induced limitations. Additionally, the proposed FSO design also employs Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) with optimized gain characteristics.

"We report a high-power high-efficiency single-mode all-fiber Raman fiber laser (RFL) operating at 1173 nm. With the core pumped by a 144-W 1120-nm Yb-doped fiber laser, an output power of 119 W at a wavelength of 1173 nm was obtained, corresponding to an optical efficiency of 82%. To the best of our knowledge, it is the highest power at the 1150-1200-nm laser band by using common silica fiber. The optical efficiency of the RFL with high output coupler (OC) reflectivity and short fiber length is discussed. We also carefully measured the output Raman spectrums under different cavity parameters and presented primary analysis. The results show that the bandwidth increases near linearly with laser output power, rather than a square-root law concluded for high Q-value and long-cavity RFLs in previous published literatures. Increasing the length of the gain fiber and the reflectivity of the OC would also broaden the output spectral bandwidth.","['Fiber lasers', 'Optical fiber couplers', 'Pump lasers', 'Power generation', 'Reflectivity', 'Cavity resonators', 'Power lasers']","['Raman fiber laser', 'high power', 'Raman spectrum']"

"We present a detailed characterization of the active area uniformity of InGaAs/InP Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) from two different design iterations. Nonuniformity of the electric field within the device active area has been measured through 2-D scans of detection efficiency and timing response to a pulsed laser. Additionally, we measured the near-infrared luminescence emitted by hot carriers during the avalanche. The nonuniformity is stronger at lower excess bias, with much higher and nonuniform electric field at the edge of the active area than expected, and it is fainter at higher excess bias, due to the saturation of the avalanche triggering efficiency. The main drawbacks are that the detection efficiency is position dependent when the SPAD is not fiber pigtailed and that the temporal response is worse, because of the nonuniform delay in the avalanche build-up across the SPAD active area.","['Photonics', 'Electric fields', 'Indium phosphide', 'Indium gallium arsenide', 'Electric breakdown', 'Tunneling', 'Image edge detection']","['Photodetectors', 'Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs)', 'photon counting', 'near-infrared detector', 'Avalanche Photodiode']"

We provide clear evidence that the topological charges of the shaped SP vortices are dominated by the PAS under all geometrical settings.

"Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a fast-developing biomedical imaging technology suitable for in vivo imaging. PAT in spherical or circular geometry gives good image resolution yet is slow or expensive in signal acquisition and image formation. Reducing the number of detection angles can ameliorate such issues, usually at the expense of image quality. This paper introduces a deconvolution-based algorithm that models the imaging process as a linear and shift-invariant system. As demonstrated by the in vivo experiment, this algorithm not only runs much faster than the back-projection algorithm but also shows stronger robustness in that it provides better image quality when detection angles are sparse. Therefore, this algorithm promises to enable real-time PAT in circular geometry.","['Robustness', 'Image reconstruction', 'Tomography', 'Geometry', 'Optical imaging', 'Biomedical imaging', 'Ultrasonic imaging', 'Image quality', 'Biomedical optical imaging', 'Iterative algorithms']","['Photoacoustic tomography', 'deconvolution reconstruction', 'sparse detection angles', 'real-time imaging', 'circular geometry']"

"This paper introduces a spectral slicing technique that extends the useful spectral range of frequency combs generated through self-phase modulation (SPM) of mode-locked laser pulses. When generating frequency combs by SPM, the spectral range with high-quality carriers is usually limited due to spectral minima carrying too little power. To overcome these limitations, we combine suitable slices of broadened and nonbroadened spectra. The concept was experimentally verified: A total number of 325 consecutive equidistant subcarriers span a bandwidth of 4 THz. All subcarriers have an optical carrier-power-to-noise-power-density ratio (OCNR) larger than 25.8 dB (0.1 nm) and were derived from one mode-locked laser with a mode linewidth of approximately 1 kHz. The signal quality of the comb and in particular of each subcarrier was ultimately tested in a terabit-per-second communication experiment. The comb quality allowed us to transmit 32.5 Tb/s over 225 km with 100 Gb/s dual polarization 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM) signals on each of the subcarriers.","['Optical fibers', 'Fiber nonlinear optics', 'Optical pulses', 'Laser mode locking', 'OFDM']","['Fiber nonlinear optics', 'optical fiber communication', 'optical pulses', 'supercontinuum generation']"

In contrast, despite a larger polarization field, WW LED on FS-GaN shows obviously enhanced peak efficiency and comparable droop compared to the counterpart with 3-nm well.

"We present a novel microwave photonic single-passband filter based on polarization control through simulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). The principle of the filter is based on a vector SBS process, which is different from the previously reported scalar SBS technique. For a radio-frequency (RF) modulated signal launched to the proposed processor, the state of polarization (SOP) of the optical carrier is rotated by 90∘through a two-step SBS process. As a result, the RF signals cannot be recovered in the photodetector (PD). To recover the desirable RF signal, the SOP of the RF modulated sideband is rotated by another pump wave. Since the orthogonal polarization condition between the optical carrier and the sideband is destroyed, the desirable RF signal can be recovered. By adjusting the wavelength of the pump wave, the frequency response of the filter is tunable in a frequency range from∼2 to 20 GHz with out-of-band rejection of∼30 dB and−3 dB bandwidth of∼20 MHz. In addition, for any modulation format, it is converted to the single-sideband (SSB) modulation by the proposed filter. Therefore, the system is expected to be immune to the fiber dispersion-induced power fading. Moreover, it is independent of the modulation formats of the incoming signal wave. The filter structure can be inserted anywhere in conventional fiber-optic links without the need for modifying the link configuration and the transmitter.","['Microwave filters', 'Scattering', 'Optical fiber filters', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical pumping']","['Microwave photonic filter', 'stimulated Brillouin scattering']"

"Chalcogenide optical fibers are currently undergoing intensive investigation with the aim of exploiting the excellent glass transmission and nonlinear characteristics in the near- and mid-infrared for several applications. Further enhancement of these properties can be obtained, for a particular application, with optical fibers specifically designed that are capable of providing low effective area together with a properly tailored dispersion, matching the characteristics of the laser sources used to excite nonlinear effects. Suspended-core photonic crystal fibers are ideal candidates for nonlinear applications, providing small-core waveguides with large index contrast and tunable dispersion. In this paper, the dispersion properties of As 2 S 3 suspended-core fibers are numerically analyzed, taking into account, for the first time, all the structural parameters, including the size and the number of the glass bridges.

By introducing multiple slots in a dielectric waveguide, we found that a much stronger evanescent field could be achieved in the surrounding media while still maintaining good optical confinement. The experimental demonstration of microring resonator sensors using single-mode waveguides having three slots indicates a 5-fold increase in sensitivity for homogeneous sensing and more than 3-fold increase in sensitivity for surface sensing in comparison to those of a waveguide without slots.

"In this paper, we report a comparative study of fiber optic sensors for applications of relative humidity (RH) monitoring in high-radiation environments. In particular, we present investigations carried out since 2011 by our multidisciplinary research group, in collaboration with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva. Our research has been first focused on the development of polyimide-coated fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, and recently, it has been extended to nanoscale metal oxide-coated long-period gratings (LPGs). Experimental tests in the [0-70] %RH range at different temperatures, before and after γ-ionizing radiation exposures, have been carried out to assess the sensors' performances in conditions required in experiments running at CERN. The advantages and disadvantages of the two proposed technologies are discussed in this paper in light of their possible application in high-energy physics environments. In particular, reported results suggest that LPG-based sensors can be preferred in some applications (particularly in presence of very low humidity levels) mainly because they are able to provide very high RH sensitivity (up to 1.4 nm/% RH), which is up to three orders of magnitude higher than that exhibited by FBG-based hygrometers.

From these expressions, we calculate the maximum allowable coupling coefficient for different values of the DMA. We show, for example, that a QSM fiber with an effective area of 250 μm 2 , a coupling coefficient κ ≤ 6 × 10 -4 km -1 , and DMA equal to 4 dB/km offers a 1-dB performance advantage over a reference pure silica core single-mode fiber for spans of 100 km.","['Couplings', 'Optical fiber theory', 'Optical fiber dispersion', 'Optical fiber networks', 'Attenuation']","['Quasi-single mode fiber', 'multipath interference', 'coherent optical communications', 'coupled-mode theory']"
"Silicon waveguides can be functionalized with an organicχ(2)-nonlinear cladding. This complements silicon photonics with the electro-optic (EO) effect originating from the cladding and enables functionalities such as pure phase modulation, parametric amplification, or THz-wave generation. Claddings based on a polymer matrix containing chromophores have been introduced, and their strongχ(2)nonlinearity has already been used to demonstrate ultralow power consuming modulators. However, these silicon–organic hybrid (SOH) devices inherit not only the advantageous properties; these polymer claddings require an alignment procedure called poling and must be operated well below their glass transition temperature. This excludes some applications. In contrast, claddings made from organic crystals come with a different set of properties. In particular, there is no need for poling. This new class of claddings also promises stronger resilience to high temperatures, better long-term stability, and photo-chemical stability. We report on the deposition of an organic crystal cladding of N-benzyl-2-methyl-4-nitroaniline (BNA) on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides, which have a CMOS-like metal stack on top. Adhering to such an architecture, which preserves the principal advantage of using CMOS-based silicon photonic fabrication processes, permits the first demonstration of high-speed modulation at 12.5 Gbit/s in this material class, which proves the availability of the EO effect from BNA on SOI also for other applications.","['Crystals', 'Silicon', 'Electrooptical waveguides', 'Electrooptic modulators', 'Glass']","['Silicon-organic hybrid', 'silicon-on-insulator', 'photonic integrated circuit', 'modulator', 'organic crystal', 'electro-optic']"

Different polarization states experience different LC cladding indices. The transmittance contrast between the x- and y-polarized modes reaches 31.9 dB, which is sensitive enough to monitor any polarization state change in the fiber. A pressure sensor with the sensitivity of 0.25 rad/N is thus demonstrated. The corresponding stress-optic coefficient of the fiber is measured at 1550-nm telecomm band.

"Recently, it was revealed that conventional gradient metasurfaces are fundamentally limited on their overall efficiency to reroute the impinging waves towards arbitrary directions in reflection and transmission. Their efficiency is particularly limited for extreme wavefront transformations. In addition, due to the fastly varying impedance profiles that these surfaces require, they usually need high-resolution fabrication processes, limiting their applicability and overall bandwidth of operation. To address these issues, the concept of metagrating was recently introduced, enabling engineered surfaces capable of manipulating light with unitary efficiency even in the limit of extreme wavefront manipulation. Metagratings are periodic or locally periodic arrays operated in the few-diffraction order regime. Their unit cell contains carefully designed scatterers that, in contrast with conventional metasurfaces, do not need to support a continuous gradient of surface impedance, and consequently are far simpler to fabricate and can afford broader bandwidths because of the larger footprint of the constituent elements. Tailoring the coupling towards the few available diffraction channels, metagratings enable wavefront transformations with high efficiency. In this paper, we review the physical mechanisms behind the functionality of metagratings and provide an overview and outlook of the recent progress in this field of science and technology.","['Reflection', 'Metasurfaces', 'Surface impedance', 'Surface waves', 'Impedance', 'Surface treatment', 'Mirrors']","['Diffraction', 'Metagratings', 'Metasurfaces']"

"We investigate the effect of optical self-feedback on the timing jitter of a passively mode-locked (ML) laser and compare the von Linde method with two pure time domain methods for calculating the timing jitter of such a system. We find that all three methods yield the same dependence of the timing jitter on the external cavity roundtrip time (delay time). Of these methods, the so-called long term jitter method is significantly less computationally expensive. We therefore use this method to investigate the influence of the delay time, feedback strength, and amplitude-phase coupling on the timing jitter. Our results show that, with vanishing amplitude-phase coupling, greater timing jitter reduction can be achieved with long delay times and larger feedback strengths, when feedback is near resonance. Off resonance, the timing jitter is increased. Non-vanishing amplitude-phase coupling can lead to destabilized pulse stream, even at the feedback main resonances.","['Timing jitter', 'Cavity resonators', 'Optical feedback', 'Laser feedback', 'Laser mode locking', 'Delays']","['Semiconductor lasers', 'laser mode locking', 'optical feedback']"
"The performances of the decode-and-forward (DF) multihop free-space optical communication system with exponentiated Weibull distribution considering the fading induced by pointing error have been studied. With Meijer's G-function, the probability density function (PDF) of the aggregated channel model and the closed-form expression for the average bit error rate (ABER) of binary pulse position modulation are derived. The average bit-error-rate performance is then investigated with different hop numbersH, turbulence strength values, receiver aperture sizes, beamwidths, and jitter variances. Compared with the case without pointing error, the mitigation effect of aperture averaging for fading is more significant over the aggregated channel, regardless of the selectedH, and it is less effective for the degradation induced by the increase inH, which can be restrained by larger beamwidth and lower jitter. The outage probability is also investigated, and the results show that aperture averaging has less of an effect on the outage probability under moderate turbulence than that under the weak turbulence condition at a given value ofH, which is different from the scenario without pointing error. After this, the end-to-end average capacity is analyzed.

"Detailed statistical investigations of the effectiveness of three widely adopted optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OOFDM) adaptive loading algorithms, including power loading (PL), bit loading, and bit-and-power loading (BPL), are undertaken, for the first time, over 1000 statistically constructed worst-case multimode fiber (MMF) links without incorporating inline optical amplification. It is shown that the BPL (PL) algorithm always offers the best (worst) transmission performance. The absolute transmission capacity differences between these algorithms are independent of signal bit rate and increase with both transmission distance and digital-to-analog converter/analog-to-digital converter (DAC/ADC) sampling rate. More importantly, numerical results also indicate that, for both worst-case and normal-case MMF links of less than 300 m, in comparison with the most sophisticated BPL algorithm, the simplest PL algorithm is sufficiently effective in escalating the OOFDM MMF system performance to its maximum potential. The effectiveness of the PL algorithm can be further improved when a large number of subcarriers are utilized. On the other hand, for relatively long MMF links (> 800 m) with their 3-dB bandwidths being much less than the transmitted OOFDM signal spectrum, the BPL algorithm has to be adopted.

"In this paper, temperature-compensated refractive-index (RI) sensing is realized by use of a single Bragg grating inscribed in a silica microfiber. The microfiber is tapered from a single-mode fiber with two short transition regions. The mode evolution and intermodal couplings are analyzed based on the coupled local-mode theory. Due to the sharp variation of transverse geometry along the fiber length, couplings between copropagating local modes are excited, and the energy of light can be distributed into different modes by the transition regions. The grating couples the incident light to phase-matched backward fundamental and higher-order modes at the individual wavelengths. The coupled higher-order modes can be partially retrieved as a result of the abrupt taper. As a result, several reflection peaks can be observed in the reflection spectrum. The peaks present different responses to surrounding RI and identical temperature sensitivity. Therefore, the temperature cross-sensitivity can be removed by measuring the wavelength separations.

"In this paper, we present an electrically controllable microoptical component for light beam steering and light intensity distribution built on the combination of nematic liquid crystal (LC) and polymer microprisms. Polymer microprism arrays are fabricated using soft embossing with elastic polydimethylsiloxane molds and ultraviolet curable resins. Surface profiling measurements show that the dimensions of the replicated prisms closely approximate those of the master prism. Two different LC alignment techniques were employed: hybrid rubbing alignment and obliquely evaporated SiO 2 alignment, both of which result in proper alignment of the LC molecules along the prism groove direction. The operation voltage of the LC components is relatively low (10 Vrms). The steering angle of a green laser beam was experimentally studied as a function of applied voltage, and a steering range of 3° was found. The active LC components also effectively deflect a collimated white light beam over a steering angle of about 2° with an efficiency of 27%-33%.

The large enhancement is due to high Purcell factor and high collection efficiency of modified L3 cavity verified by far-field patterns.

"Resonant micro-optic gyros (RMOGs) with waveguide-type ring resonators are promising candidates for applications demanding small, light, and robust gyros. However, the nonzero bias at the gyro output fluctuates in terms of both the bias and the bias stability, owing to the temperature variations of the waveguide-type resonator. In particular, the temperature sensitivity of the bias stability varies greatly depending on the temperature. This paper intends to reveal that these observed fluctuations arise from the temperature-dependent polarization fluctuation. We will investigate how such polarization fluctuation affects the bias of the gyro-output through the state of polarization of the input beam, the polarization characteristics of the resonator coupler, and the temperature variation of the resonator. Both our numerical simulation and experimental verification are carried out, which, for the first time to our best knowledge, demonstrate that the long-term stability of the RMOG can be significantly improved by optimizing the temperature of the waveguide resonator.","['Silicon compounds', 'Thermal stability', 'Resonant frequency', 'Optical waveguides', 'Stability analysis', 'Optical resonators', 'Integrated optics', 'Gyroscopes']","['Integrated optics', 'optical resonators', 'gyroscopes']"

"Nanophotonic structures enabling the engineering of linear dispersion are often exploited for nonlinear processing. However, the dispersion of the nonlinear response has been generally overlooked, also because of the difficulty of accurately taking this effect into account. Here, we first show the necessity of considering the nonlinear dispersion and then propose a simplified approach through which the modeling can be performed. As an example, we consider waveguides in which a large group index and low group velocity dispersion are achieved at the same time by modifying a single design parameter, i.e., an asymmetric translation of the hole rows closest to the core. It is shown that the dependence on the wavelength of the normalized Bloch mode overlap integrals for self-phase modulation (SPM) can be interpolated by a four-parameter formula that is similar to the Morse potential. The parameters can be related to specific properties of the nonlinear SPM coefficient, which in the specific case depends on the translation parameter, by simple linear and exponential functions. Cross-phase modulation and four-wave mixing coefficients can then be derived from the self-phase one, through a geometric mean, slightly corrected to account for the interacting wave detuning, and the complete modeling of nonlinear dispersion is achieved.","['Dispersion', 'Modulation', 'Indexes', 'Optical waveguides', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Mathematical model']","['Four-wave mixing', 'photonic crystals', 'Kerr effect', 'nonlinear integrated optics', 'nonlinear effects in nanostructures', 'photonic materials and engineered photonic structures', 'slow light']"

"Operation frequency is discussed for near-infrared photodiodes (PDs) using Ge layers on Si, which are indispensable for the photonic-electronic convergence on an Si chip. Based on the formula derived from the continuity equation, Ge pin PDs on Si are found to operate with the 3-dB cut-off frequency as high as 80 GHz, which is limited by the slow diffusion current from the n and p layers. In order to increase the frequency, a new structure is examined, which is composed of a p-Ge/i-Si/n-Si heterojunction. In this structure, electrons generated in the p layer of Ge are collected by the i layer of wider gap Si, being similar to uni-traveling-carrier PDs of InGaAs/InP in III-V systems.

"Numerical models play an important role in the design of the optical fiber drawing process for tailored mechanical properties and optical transmission characteristics. The rigorous part of a numerical fiber drawing model is the determination of the neck-down profile, which is calculated based on a force balance along the fiber axis, requiring intensive numerical iterations for solution. An alternative approach has been the use of an empirical neck-down profile based on experimental results; however, this approach is restricted to the simulation of the particular drawing conditions used in the experiments. This paper presents an approach to numerical simulations of an optical fiber drawing process where an analytical hyperbolic tangent function is used to describe the neck-down shape in a generalized manner, and the parameters of the function are determined based on a force balance for the drawing conditions. The physical model is based on a 2-D numerical analysis of the flow, heat, and mass transfer phenomena involved in the drawing and cooling processes during the manufacturing of optical glass fibers. The effects of fiber draw speed, maximum furnace temperature, and the furnace length on the neck-down profile are investigated and discussed in terms of the final fiber radius and the draw tension.

"A system involving W-band (75-110 GHz) optical millimeter (mm)-wave generation using the external optical modulator (EOM) in a radio-over-fiber (RoF) link is presented for satisfying the requirements for multi-gigabit-per-second data rates. A 90-GHz mm-wave signal was generated by a nonupling (nine times) increase in only a 10-GHz local oscillator by biasing the EOM at its zero level and choosing an appropriate modulation index. To achieve a fast transmission speed wirelessly, high spectral efficiency (SE), and better transmission performance, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is used. The bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM) of the system were measured for three different fiber lengths and for a wireless distance of 1-5 m.

"In this paper, we propose a hybrid multidimensional coded-modulation (CM) scheme based on a new multidimensional signal constellation design as a solution to limited bandwidth and high energy consumption of information infrastructure. This multidimensional signal constellation, herewith called vector-quantization-based signal constellation design (VQ-SCD), is based on the vector quantization theory. The proposed scheme employs both the electrical basis functions (in the form of the prolate spheroidal wave functions) and the optical basis functions (in the form of polarization and spatial mode states) as optical basis functions. The proposed coded VQ-SCD scheme is the enabling technology for optical serial transport with bit rates exceeding 1000 Tb/s (1 Pb/s). In addition, the CM scheme we proposed allows for the adaptive, elastic, and dynamic allocation of the bandwidth. This fine granularity bandwidth manipulation is envisioned as a part of future software-defined optical networking.","['Constellation diagram', 'Optical polarization', 'Vectors', 'Probability density function', 'Optical fiber networks', 'Optical signal processing', 'Algorithm design and analysis']","['Microwave photonics signal processing', 'optical Ethernet', 'advanced FEC', 'LDPC coding', 'coded modulation', 'multidimensional signaling', 'elastic optical networks']"

The proposed comb filter consists of a rotatable polarizer, a PBS, and a 3-dB fiber coupler. By adjusting the polarization state of the lasing light launched into the PBS, the multiwavelength switchable operation can be easily achieved. When the proposed comb filter was incorporated into the laser cavity, up to 11 multiwavelength switchable lasing lines with a channel spacing of 1.2 nm were obtained.

"We propose and experimentally demonstrate a dynamic encryption method to realize physical layer security for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing passive optical network (OFDM-PON). In our scheme, encryption of the downstream signal is obtained by applying exclusive or (xor) operation between optical network units' (ONUs') downstream signals and received upstream signals at the optical line terminal side. The upstream signals are used as secure keys for corresponding ONUs. Then the encrypted downstream signals are sent to the ONU sides, where the downstream signal can be retrieved by applying xor operation again between the encrypted downstream signal and the stored upstream signal. Since each ONU cannot obtain the upstream signals of other ONUs, only the ONU itself can recover its downstream signal from the encrypted downstream signal. Moreover, the secure key is dynamically changing along with the upstream signal, significantly improving the security of the downstream signal for the OFDM-PON system. A 5-Gb/s 16-quadrature amplitude modulation OFDM signal with xor-based encryption has been successfully implemented over a 25-km standard single-mode fiber.

"Recirculating frequency shifting (RFS) has attracted much attention for its advantages in flexible and high-quality optical frequency comb (OFC) generation. As the number of tones increases, the phase coherence of the tones plays a very important role in the stability of the generated OFC. It is found in this paper that by controlling the phase coherence of the tones, the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the generated OFC will decrease sharply. This will effectively relieve the distortion caused by fiber nonlinearity, which will enable the loop to support more tones under the condition of constant output power. Based on the phase coherence control method, a 100-tone OFC with 10-GHz frequency spacing and a single RFS loop is successfully realized.","['Frequency modulation', 'Peak to average power ratio', 'Frequency control', 'Coherence', 'Radio frequency', 'Amplitude modulation']","['recirculating frequency shifting (RFS)', 'optical frequency comb (OFC)', 'phase coherence control']"

This spontaneous Rayleigh seed may be stronger than the quantum background and may affect the mode instability thresholds of fiber amplifiers. This new seed estimate can be incorporated in STRS models to improve threshold calculations.","['Rayleigh scattering', 'Noise', 'Optical refraction', 'Optical scattering', 'Optical variables control', 'Refractive index']","['Fiber lasers', 'laser amplifiers', 'fiber non-linear optics', 'scattering', 'theory', 'modeling']"

"We propose a novel approach for the generation of flat optical frequency comb (OFC) using a single polarization modulator (PolM) and a Brillouin-assisted power equalizer (BAPE). The reference radio-frequency (RF) signal applied to the PolM is provided by an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO). The spectra of the optical signals launched to the BAPE are optimized in advance for the generation of OFCs with different number of lines. The BAPE is introduced to flatten the uneven OFC lines by attenuating the optical lines having power beyond the threshold of the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and amplifying the ones having power below the SBS threshold with the amplifier inside the BAPE. In addition, the OFC generator is optical wavelength independent since there is no optical filter involved in our approach. We experimentally demonstrated that the proposed OFC generator can produce 5, 7, 9, and 11 lines within a spectral flatness of 0.5, 1.5, 2, and 4.1 dB, respectively.","['Optical attenuators', 'Optical variables measurement', 'Gain', 'Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers', 'Radio frequency', 'Scattering']","['Optical frequency comb', 'stimulated Brillouin scattering', 'polarization modulation']"

"In this paper, we propose a coded orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based heterogeneous transparent optical networking scenario. The OAM is associated with the azimuthal phase dependence of the complex electric field. Because OAM eigenstates are orthogonal, they can be used as basis functions for multidimensional signal constellations. From Shannon's theory, we know that information capacity is a linear function of a number of dimensions and a logarithmic function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, through multidimensional signal constellations, we can dramatically improve the overall aggregate data rate per single wavelength. The ability to generate the OAM modes, such as Bessel and Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, in both multimode fibers (MMFs) and free-space optical (FSO) links will allow the realization of heterogeneous transparent FSO-fiber-optics communication networks, composed of MMF and FSO links, with ultrahigh bits-per-photon efficiencies. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed heterogeneous optical networking scenario. We demonstrate the high potential of the proposed network to solve high-bandwidth demands and interoperability problems simultaneously. Finally, we prove that a dramatic improvement in spectral efficiency is possible by employing this OAM-based multidimensional signaling scheme.","['Optical fiber networks', 'Optical fibers', 'Modulation', 'Parity check codes', 'Nonlinear optics']","['Orbital angular momentum (OAM) modulation', 'heterogeneous free-space optical multimode fiber (FSO-MMF) optical networking', 'low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes', 'coded-modulation']"

At very low index contrast, the resolution worsens dramatically, particularly for Δn <; 0.01, where we observe a resolution exceeding 10 μm for our device.

"The wavelength tunability of all-normal-dispersion (ANDi) ytterbium (Yb)-doped mode-locked fiber laser is experimentally investigated, where the laser is mode-locked by nonlinear polarization rotation and the wavelength is adjusted by an intracavity tunable filter. The influences of pump power, gain fiber length, and cavity length (i.e., repetition rate) on the mode-locking wavelength and output spectrum are investigated. It is found that the tunable range of mode-locking wavelength depends on the length of the Yb-doped fiber, as well as the cavity loss, and is independent of the cavity length. Mode-locking in a longer wavelength regime can be obtained by increasing the gain fiber length, although the length depends on the cavity loss. Moreover, the effects of pump power, central wavelength, Yb-doped fiber length, and cavity length on other output parameters are discussed. The variation range of pump power to keep the mode-locking status is also analyzed.

"A nanoplasmonic loop-stub structure is proposed. Its fundamental properties are studied and compared with those of single-stub and double-stub structures of similar structural parameters. The results show that loop-stub structure has two sets of resonances. One set is similar to the resonances of single-stub and double-stub structures; these resonances are tunable by varying the widths of vertical branches. In contrast, other sets of resonances, which are unique to this structure, can be independently controlled by varying the width of the horizontal branch. The advantage of the loop-stub design over conventional stubs is that it can support traveling-wave-like modes in addition of the standing-wave modes. This feature offers a potential to realize directional add/drop filters for either forward or backward dropping. Moreover, it can provide efficient coupling between waveguides of different widths.","['Optical waveguides', 'Periodic structures', 'Optical filters', 'Band pass filters', 'Filtering theory', 'Resonator filters', 'Couplings']","['Plasmonics', 'waveguide devices', 'nanocavities', 'modeling']"

"In this paper, we present a new adaptive image registration nonuniformity correction method with the function of eliminating ghost artifacts. This method assumes that the irradiation of objects stays unchanged during the adjacent two frames' time interval and then corrects the corresponding pixels of two frames by the result of image registration. With regard to real-time continuous image sequence, we first calculate the displacement vectors based on their row and column projections. Then, by bidirectional image registration, we can get the overlapped area matrices of two frames accurately. Meanwhile, a variance threshold is set to judge the scene classification, and then, displacement revising is selectively added to decrease stripe noise. Considering that moving targets exist, the error function for updating is also accordingly adapted to eliminate the ghost artifacts. By using the least-mean-square-error iteration algorithm, the gain and offset coefficients of the overlapped area can be updated in real time with the image sequence adaptively. The advantages of this algorithm lie in its high efficiency of image processing, low computational complexity, and few ghost artifacts.

It is shown that such cascaded strippers can overcome the challenging problems of localized heating and thermal degradation of the recoating materials, which are limiting factors for the conventional high power cladding light strippers. The power-handling capability of the device is tested up to cladding light of power up to 150 W. A high attenuation of 18 dB has been achieved, whereas the maximum local temperature is less than 64 ° C. We anticipate that this simple configuration offers a practical solution for cladding light extracting in high power fiber lasers and amplifiers.","['Plastics', 'Refractive index', 'Optical fiber devices', 'Optical fiber amplifiers', 'Attenuation', 'Diode lasers', 'Fiber lasers']","['Cladding light stripper', 'double-cladding fiber', 'fiber lasers and amplifiers']"

"InGaN/GaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a graded-composition multiple quantum well (GQW) were designed not only to investigate the effect of polarization field on the efficiency droop in InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) but to find out possible solutions to prevent or reduce the efficiency droop in GaN-based LEDs as well. Pulsed electroluminescence measurement, to avoid heating effects partly, revealed that the output intensity peak occurs at∼280 A/cm2current density for the GQW structure, whereas for a conventional structure, it occurs at a much lower current density of∼150 A/cm2. The relative quantum efficiency indicates that the efficiency droop in GQW LEDs was reduced effectively due to the reduction in polarization field in the active layer. In the test GQW structure with inverse indium composition variation direction, electrons escape from the active region, which is in company with rapid saturation of output power and decrease in efficiency observed at high current density. It indicates that at high current density, the electron leakage is obvious. These results suggest that the polarization field in the active layer and the consequent electron leakage are probably the main mechanism responsible for the efficiency droop at high current injection levels.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Gallium nitride', 'Quantum well devices', 'Current density', 'Indium', 'Power generation', 'Charge carrier processes']","['Metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)', 'InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW)', 'electron leakage', 'efficiency droop']"

"We explain modal processes in 2-D guided-mode resonance reflectors with subwavelength periods in terms of the mode structure of quasi-equivalent 1-D grating-based reflectors. The 1-D gratings are designed via a second-order effective-medium theory. The principal features in the reflection spectra of the 2-D devices show good quantitative agreement with the corresponding 1-D grating spectra for small modulation strength. Thereby, clear connections are established with the TE and TM modal states of a reflector. For reflectors made with silicon that has a high index of refraction, there is qualitative agreement between the 2-D spectra and the concomitant 1-D modal signatures. Two-dimensional reflectors with periodic rods and holes are treated. In both cases, it is found that the spectra are dominated by contributions from a single polarization state in the 1-D grating equivalent. The results and methods provided herein enable improved understanding of the physical properties of 2-D resonant reflectors and the related 2-D modulated devices, including photonic crystal slabs. Hence, this methodology facilitates the design of 2-D reflectors in general as is straightforwardly applied to device architectures, materials, and spectral regions beyond those treated here.","['Gratings', 'Reflectivity', 'Reflection', 'Modulation', 'Electric fields', 'Refractive index', 'Optical waveguides']","['Engineered photonic nanostructures', 'diffractive optics', 'subwavelength structures', 'nanophotonics', 'guided-mode resonance', 'effective-medium theory']"

"We propose a scheme that can attain the same transmission bit rate as the corresponding conventional polarization-division-multiplexed (PDM) quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) scheme while occupying lower bandwidth and, hence, achieving a higher spectral efficiency. In contrast to the conventional approach, which increases the symbol rate and thus the occupied bandwidth to transmit the redundant symbols due to forward error correction (FEC), the proposed approach expands the underlying signal constellation in size and reduces the FEC code rate accordingly to form a mechanism that can achieve coded transmission without bandwidth expansion. Such a scheme can find applications in scenarios where there exist stringent bandwidth restrictions and bandwidth expansion is not considered as a viable option. Although the idea of constellation expansion in lieu of bandwidth expansion is mainly associated with Ungerboeck's trellis-coded modulation (TCM), our proposed nonbinary low-density parity-check (LDPC)-coded modulation scheme shows that block-coded modulation schemes can also be used with expanded constellations to achieve transmission without bandwidth expansion and without resorting to TCM. Our results reveal that for small to medium constellation sizes, the proposed scheme can preserve bandwidth while not experiencing significant increase in required optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). For large constellation sizes, however, to keep the increase in required OSNR at manageable levels, we propose using controlled bandwidth expansion where constellation expansion and bandwidth expansion are used simultaneously to obtain a balance between the two critical system parameters of bandwidth and required OSNR.","['Bandwidth', 'Parity check codes', 'Forward error correction', 'Modulation', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Optical noise', 'Encoding']","['Coherent communication', 'coded modulation', 'fiber optics communication', 'forward error correction (FEC)', 'low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes']"

The proposed design’s downlink performance is analyzed, taking into account many challenging issues, including beam spreading loss, cloud attenuation, statistical behaviors of the atmospheric turbulence in the dual-hop channel, and pointing misalignment due to the UAV hovering. Different performance metrics are analytically derived based on channel modelings, including outage probability, average transmission rate, and achievable spectrum efficiency. In addition, the average system BER, which satisfies the design constraint, is also numerically obtained.

"This paper reports the outcomes of the tests that we conducted as online measurements for the evaluation of one optical fiber long-period grating produced by a fusion technique in a single-mode radiation-hardened optical fiber, and subjected to gamma irradiation. During the irradiation, the grating temperature was monitored. Before the irradiation, the temperature sensitivity of the grating was 27.7 pm/°C, while the value of this parameter postirradiation was found to be 29.3 pm/°C. The spectral characteristics of the grating were measured (i) in the laboratory with an ANDO AQ6317C optical spectrum analyzer and (ii) online, for the first time, with a LUNA OBR 4600 backscatter reflectometer, operating in the frequency acquisition mode. Such online measurement enables the study of recovery effects during the irradiation. The wavelength dip of the grating shifted under gamma irradiation, with 16 pm/kGy for the maximum total dose of 45 kGy. At room temperature, the recovery of the irradiation-induced shift of the wavelength dip was almost complete in about 120 h, at a rate of 6.7 pm/h. Postirradiation heating of the sensor produced the reversing of the recovery effect.

"Graphene-based metamaterials are gaining popularity for developing various reconfigurable and electrically tunable optical devices – especially in terahertz (THz) and infrared (IR) bands. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to investigate the broadband metamaterial-based absorber that efficiently absorbs the THz radiation ranging from 2.2 to 4.6 THz. The proposed absorber comprises a simple meta-square ring of graphene, which possesses different slots in its structure to induce multiple plasmonic resonances. It is observed that the proposed absorber manifests above 95% absorption for the normally incident THz waves, and it also maintains its absorption value over 80% for different obliquely incident operating conditions. Furthermore, the proposed absorber shows polarization-insensitive features. In addition, the absorption characteristics regulate from 95% to 15% by adjusting the chemical potential of graphene from 1 eV to 0.1 eV. Some of the salient features of the proposed absorber is largest reported bandwidth for single layer absorber with smallest footprint without sacrificing polarization insensitivity or amplitude tunability. From the application point of view, it could provide the pathway for implementing switching, cloaking, smart absorbers, and detection phenomena in the THz range.","['Graphene', 'Absorption', 'Metamaterials', 'Resonant frequency', 'Broadband communication', 'Wideband', 'Optical sensors']","['Terhertz', 'broadband', 'polarization-insensitive metamaterial', 'absorber', 'graphene', 'tunable']"

"Coding metasurfaces incorporated with reconfigurable elements can dynamically control electromagnetic waves to realize reconfigurable multiple functionalities. The mostly existing active devices usually work in microwave band and have little ability to dynamically control terahertz waves. Here, a graphene-based coding metasurface (GBCM) is presented to realize dynamic beam steering for terahertz waves. The coding state “1” of the proposed GBCM can be continuously tuned to “0” by Fermi level of an integral graphene film. In order to verify the working principle, two examples are designed to demonstrate the dynamic tunability of the proposed GBCM for terahertz waves. One is dynamic multi-beam switching and another is dynamic diffusion switching. Under the normal illumination of terahertz waves, a 1D periodic-sequence GBCM produces dual-, tri- and single-beam by setting Fermi level as 0.05 eV, 0.15 eV and 0.70 eV, respectively. Similarly, a 2D periodic-sequence GBCM produces quad-, penta- and single-beam by setting Fermi level as 0.05 eV, 0.11 eV and 0.70 eV, respectively. In the case of aperiodic coding sequence, reflected waves can be dynamically switched from diffusion to mirror reflection by increasing Fermi level from 0.05 eV to 0.70 eV. The above functionalities are well verified by theoretical calculations and numerical simulations.","['Encoding', 'Metasurfaces', 'Graphene', 'Reflection', 'Conductivity', 'Switches', 'Metamaterials']","['Beam steering', 'coding metasurface', 'graphene', 'terahertz']"

When the temporal waveform was simulated using the Fourier components, the oscillating behavior due to the efficient DFG of the two cavity modes was clearly observed after the initial ultrafast response near the incident surface. Assuming the exponential decay of signal sensitivity in the high-frequency region, the simulated results were consistent with the experimentally measured ones for coupled cavity structures grown on (113)B GaAs substrates.","['Cavity resonators', 'Gallium arsenide', 'Nonhomogeneous media', 'Electric fields', 'Ultrafast optics', 'Surface waves', 'Substrates']","['Terahertz generation', 'optical microcavity', 'III-V semiconductors', 'frequency mixing', 'femtosecond laser']"

"We achieved optically pumped lasing actions of extremely small optical resonators, which have 1.4-2-μm-diameter GaN hexagonal nanorings with wall widths of 60-140 nm. The hexagonal nanorings were grown by rf-plasma molecular beam epitaxy (rf-MBE) with Ti-mask selective area growth (SAG). Due to the nanometer scale of the wall width, the propagation of threading dislocations through the wall was suppressed, and high crystalline quality of the nanoring resonators was achieved. The hexagonal nanorings possessed a fine cavity configuration of crystallographically flat outer walls and consisted of hexagonally connected sixfold side sections. The periodic boundary condition for each section with a short length limits the number of longitudinal resonance wavelengths, and narrowing the wall suppresses the occurrence of lasing in higher transverse modes. Therefore, both contribute to the lasing action in a single longitudinal mode of the hexagonal nanoring.","['Nanostructured materials', 'Cavity resonators', 'Optical resonators', 'Optical waveguides', 'Optical device fabrication', 'Optical variables control', 'Optical surface waves']","['Nanostructures', 'photonic materials', 'semiconductors', 'solid-state lasers']"

"Microwave frequency downconversion is optically implemented by using two cascaded polarization modulators (PolMs), characterized by full-frequency-range coverage and high conversion efficiency. In this proposed approach, the incident radio-frequency signal (RF) and the local oscillator signal (LO) are applied to the first PolM at the transmitter and the second one at the receiver, respectively. Effective optical carrier suppression can be achieved using the cascaded PolMs, whereas the optical sidebands induced by the RF and the LO signals remain unchanged. Since no additional optical filter is needed, the lower operation frequency limit in other approaches with an optical filter is eliminated, such that a full-frequency-range coverage is ensured in this approach. Meanwhile, the use of optical carrier suppression (OCS) enables high conversion efficiency for microwave downconversion. In the proof-of-concept experiments, the conversion efficiency is improved by over 20 dB within the frequency range from 2 to 15 GHz, as compared to those of cascaded modulators without OCS.

"A high-spectral-efficiency photonic frequency down-conversion approach for wavelength-division-multiplexing radio-over-fiber (WDM-ROF) uplinks is proposed and experimentally investigated. In the approach, an optical frequency comb serves as the carriers of multiple channels, and each comb line is modulated by the upstream radio-frequency (RF) signal via single-sideband modulation. At the central station, the beating between the sideband with upstream signal and its adjacent optical carrier leads to photonic frequency down-conversion without additional optical frequency shifts. Due to the band overlapping or the reduction of guard band between adjacent channels, a high spectral efficiency is achieved for WDM-ROF uplinks. A two-channel experimental uplink is established, where a 15-GHz RF signal carrying quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) data is successfully down-converted to a 2-GHz intermediate frequency (IF) signal. For the 10-Mb/s QPSK data, the measured eye diagrams and the constellation diagrams clearly show the effectiveness of the frequency down-conversion and the influence of the transmission distance.

"We design an ytterbium-doped large pitch photonic quasi-crystal fiber (PQF) for amplifying high-energy ultrashort laser pulses. The proposed fiber exhibits unique properties such as very large mode area (4660 μm 2 ), less attenuation (0.42 dB/km), high overlapping factor (0.55 for the fundamental mode), and low bending loss. These properties help amplify with high-average power ultrashort pulses with less distortion and high efficiency. To meet these requirements, we design a fiber with optimum gain filtering as well as loss filtering.

"We present systematic predictions for light enhancement in optical nanowires with nanoscale air holes in the core through numerical modeling. We show that the light intensity within such holes is strongly dependent on the hole size and refractive index of the host material and that light enhancement becomes significant only when the hole size is less than a critical value: 70 nm for silica and F2 nanowires and 50 nm for a As 2 S 3 nanowire. High index As 2 S 3 nanowires exhibit nearly eight times higher average mode intensity than silica glass for hole sizes of less than 10 nm.

"We report the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-enabled mechanically tunable negative-index photonic crystal lens, which was comprised of 2-D photonic crystal and symmetrical electro-thermal actuators. The 2-D photonic crystal was made of a honeycomb lattice of silicon rods embedded in an SU-8 membrane. A silicon input waveguide and deflection block were also fabricated for light in-coupling and monitoring of focused spot size, respectively. When actuated, the electro-thermal actuators stretched the photonic crystal and consequently modified the photonic band structure. This, in turn, modified the focal length of the photonic crystal lens. The fabricated device was fully characterized using a tunable laser and an infrared camera while being actuated with a constant current source. The intensity and lateral spot size observed at the deflection block gradually increased as the applied current increased from 0 to 0.3 A.

"We have developed the expressions for terminal currents in transistor lasers (TLs) having a single quantum well (SQW) as well as multiple quantum wells (MQWs) of different well and barrier widths in the base by solving a continuity equation relating the bulk carrier density with the 2-D carrier density via virtual states (VS). The gain in the quantum well (QW) is obtained by considering strain, 2-D density-of-states, polarization-dependent momentum matrix element, Fermi statistics, and Lorentzian broadening. A calculated value of 7.06 mA of threshold base current for three 16-nm-wide QWs in the base indicates a substantial reduction from the calculated and experimental value of 21.5 mA for a 16-nm-wide InGaAs QW in GaAs base. A similar reduction is also obtained for three QWs of different widths having variable barrier widths. The estimated modulation bandwidths (BWs) are higher in the case of MQW structures than in the SQW TL. Above threshold, the effective base recombination time, including spontaneous and stimulated processes, gives rise to a fast recombination process in the base, which leads to resonance-free modulation response.

"A noise reduction method of Fresnel computer-generated hologram (CGH) using wavelet transform and smooth filter is presented. Noise in hologram is very difficult to remove because an interference pattern is recorded on a digital camera during the digital processing. It also occurs in the reconstruction process, which is affected by discrete quantizing levels and optical experiment setup. So, we develop an algorithm that is capable of changing pixel values at different scales with imaginary or real value according to the requirements of each position in the hologram. A new algorithm is proposed to satisfy the above requirements using a mathematical transformation between the smooth filter function and mother wavelet function in a wavelet transform. In this paper, a theoretical model to predict the effect of noise is described and verified by the experimental results. Based on this, the resultant noises in the reconstructed image by Fresnel CGH algorithm are decreased clearly when spatial light modulator (SLM) for 3D object is placed at distance from 260 mm to 900 mm.

"We experimentally investigate and characterize the improvement in thresholding capability of a compact highly Ge-doped nonlinear interferometer-based all-optical thresholder using optical offset spectral filtering.

Although the nonlinear interferometer-based thresholder has been useful for signal regeneration and thresholding, it has several limitations, including severe pulse distortion due to pulse bifurcation at high input powers and a fixed power transfer function.

By tuning the central wavelength of the passband optical filter, a single-passband MPF with a frequency tuning range from 5 to 35 GHz is obtained. The 3-dB bandwidth and the out-of-band suppression ratio are measured to be 4 GHz and 20 dB, respectively. In addition, the tunability of the MPF that is dependent on the driven current of the DFB-SOA is also experimentally investigated.","['Optical filters', 'Passband', 'Optical amplifiers', 'Optical fibers', 'Stimulated emission', 'Optical modulation']","['Radio frequency photonics', 'Laser amplifiers', 'Frequency filtering']"

"A novel optical frequency-hopping scheme in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) systems is proposed to achieve secure communications with high capacity. Frequency hopping is realized by the hopping of digital signals among different channels. In the proposed system, the signal from any source is separated into small segments in the time domain, and the segments are carried by more than one different-wavelength optical carrier. All the optical waves in the proposed WDM system are modulated by signals from two or more sources at different times. The signal from a certain source is also interference to signals from other sources. Hopping, synchronization, de-hopping, and routing are all digitally implemented in field-programmable gate array chips. The system is reconfigurable by software to adapt to different rates.

On the other hand, by taking advantage of the photon–photon resonance, the laser has high modulation efficiency around the beating frequency that is far beyond the intrinsic modulation bandwidth of the lasers. It eliminates the use of high-speed external modulators and dramatically reduces the threshold gain of the oscillator.

"The inherent data-erasing functionality of a 10-Gb/s colorless Fabry-Pérot laser diode (FPLD) wavelength controlled by reusing a downstream optical carrier with encoded data is explored. By operating the injection-locked colorless FPLD at high dc bias, the unique in situ data-erasing mechanism is attributed to the almost identical power-to-current slope, regardless of optical injection-locking level. When reusing the downstream carrier, the injection-locked upstream colorless FPLD can significantly suppress the extinction ratio of the residual 10-Gb/s downstream data from 7.1 to <; 1 dB. This facilitates direct reuse of the downstream carrier without the need for an additional data eraser.

Even with a downstream injection power value of only -9 dBm, the upstream bit error rate (BER) of such a dual functional colorless FPLD biased at ≥2I th indicates a BER of <; 1 × 10 -10 .

"In recent years, visible light positioning (VLP) systems have attracted considerable attention because they do not require additional infrastructures. However, most existing researches on the VLP ignore the impact of wall diffuse reflection, which can lead to the dramatical decrease of the position accuracy performance near the indoor walls and corners. In this paper, we design an indoor VLP system with one single light-emitting diode (LED) and a rotatable photodetector (PD), and then propose an indoor VLP algorithm based on machine learning (ML) methods with concern for the indoor reflection of the optical propagation. The proposed positioning process is implemented via two stages: area classification and positioning. During the area classification stage, by using the random forest (RF) algorithm, the entire room is divided into one interior area and four wall or corner zones. In the interior area, the rotatable PD is directly used to determine the target location. In the four wall or corner zones, a hybrid positioning algorithm based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is developed to improve localization accuracy near the indoor walls and corners. Simulation results show that by using the proposed indoor VLP system with the rotatable PD and the hybrid algorithm, the maximum and averaged positioning errors of wall or corner zones drop from 137.96 cm and 15.63 cm, to 38.34 cm and 1.43 cm, respectively, and the averaged positioning error of the whole room decreases from 11.97 cm to 1.74 cm.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Radio frequency', 'Visible light communication', 'Machine learning algorithms', 'Interference', 'Detectors', 'Clustering algorithms']","['Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)', 'extreme learning machine (ELM)', 'Internet of things (IoT)', 'random forest (RF)', 'rotatable PD', 'single LED', 'visible light positioning (VLP)']"

The switching mechanism is discussed by analyzing the electric field and power loss distributions, as well as the impedance matching principle. Moreover, the buffering capability and the absorption performance both remain noticeable within a wide range of the incidence angle. This work offers a strategy for the function-switching metamaterial which provides potential applications in terahertz detecting, switching and slow light devices.","['Metamaterials', 'Optical switches', 'Strips', 'Optical buffering', 'Insulators', 'Absorption', 'Vanadium']","['Switchable metamaterial', 'vanadium dioxide', 'buffering', 'absorbing']"

"We report on a simple approach of time-delayed reservoir computing (RC) based on a two-element phased laser array for image identification. Here the phased laser array with optical feedback and injection is trained according to the representative characteristics extracted through histograms of oriented gradients.

By optimizing the parameters of the RC, we achieve an identification accuracy of 97.44% on the MNIST dataset and 85.46% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. These results indicate that our proposed RC indeed allows accurate classification of handwritten digit and fashion production.

"Yellow electroluminescence (EL) of a 20-pair Si-rich SiN x /SiO x superlattice is demonstrated by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and annealing process. After annealing at 900 ° C for 30 min, two photoluminescence (PL) peaks at 480 and 570 nm are observed to blue-shift the PL wavelength, and the corresponding peak intensity is enhanced due to the self-aggregation of Si quantum dots (QDs). When increasing the annealing temperature to 1050 ° C , the PL peaks caused by the aggregated Si-QDs in SiN x and SiO x layers red-shift to 500 and 600 nm, thereby shifting the PL peak wavelength to 520 nm.

"This paper proposes the use of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) for the deflection monitoring of a micromegas (MM) tracking particle detector to be installed at the European Organization for Nuclear Research during a major upgrade of the experiment ATLAS within 2018. MM detectors are designed to reach high spatial and time resolution, even if the design is not yet finalized. One mandatory issue for the MM detector is a precise monitoring of the deflection of the drift and read-out electrodes and/or of the panel hosting the electrodes. To this aim, FBG strain sensors are proposed and experimentally investigated as a sensing solution to monitor the strain state of the detector support panel hosting the drift and read-out electrodes. Finally, simple postprocessing analysis based on classical beam theory considering a rigid body permits calculating the panel deflection.

"An electron-beam-fabricated subwavelength grating coupler for direct side coupling of light emission from a high-power laser diode array (LDA) was studied theoretically and implemented experimentally. A gold-embedded silica-based design for grating coupler was employed to minimize the thermal expansion caused by the accumulated heat from light absorption by metal part of the grating coupler. In addition, with the consideration of the backward diffraction loss and the groove wall nonverticality caused by fabrication distortion, the grating pitch and groove width were optimized for the highest coupling efficiency. According to the experimental results, the grating coupler is capable of coupling light power up to 21 W from a 976-nm continuous-wave-operated LDA into the inner clad of a 400-μm-diameter double-clad fiber with an overall coupling efficiency of 50%. Furthermore, an LDA side-pumped ytterbium-doped DCF laser by using the grating coupler was demonstrated. By fine tuning the slow-axis collimation lens array, the laser-pumping scheme can easily be switched between bidirectional pumping and unidirectional pumping. Compared with the unidirectionally pumped fiber laser of the same gain fiber length, the laser slope efficiency of the bidirectionally pumped fiber laser was increased by 18% because of a better gain distribution over the fiber length. Finally, the signal output power of 10 W with a slope efficiency of 61% was achieved for the bidirectional side-pumped fiber laser.","['Gratings', 'Optical fiber couplers', 'Couplers', 'Diffraction', 'Laser excitation', 'Diffraction gratings', 'Fiber lasers']","['Diode-pumped lasers', 'gratings', 'diffractive optics']"

A hanging stick, which is dipped into a liquid tank, is directly mounted on the other end of the rotatable lever. The buoyancy will increase as the stick depth of immersion into the liquid increases. The tension the MZI subjected will increase according to the proportion of L 1 /L 2 on account of the lever principle.

"An optical distribution network (ODN) sharing scheme to integrate mobile backhaul networks with the existing passive optical network (PON) systems is proposed and demonstrated. With the ODN sharing scheme, the expense of building new fibers for the next-generation fifth-generation (5G) mobile backhaul networks can be reduced. As many wavelengths are allocated to the already deployed PON systems, there remain limited wavelengths for the mobile backhaul systems. Hence, to efficiently increase the serving cell sites of the 5G systems, spectral-efficient orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is adopted in the mobile backhaul systems. In order to reduce the latency of the system, adaptive adjustment of the OFDM signals for different transmission distances is averted. The OFDM signals are transmitted only using specific available bandwidth. The available bandwidth for each wavelength is studied according to the power fading relationship between the transmission distances and the chirp induced from signal modulation. A proof-of-concept demonstration experiment has been performed. In our results, 20.17 Gb/s with a bit error rate (BER) lower than3.8×10−3was realized with a split ratio of 256 and a 40-km transmission distance of the PON ODN.

"The advantages of blue InGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with thickness-chirped barriers in the active region have been investigated by using the Crosslight APSYS programs. The results show that the output power of the proposed LED is increased 80% and the efficiency droop is decreased from 59% in conventional LED to 28% at the current of 250 mA. Based on the analysis of electrical and optical characteristics, these improvements are mainly attributed to the change of electrostatic field in the active region by using thickness-chirped barriers. In the even-numbered barriers, the fields are increased, which gets rid of more seriously bended valence band and results in decreased barrier heights for hole transport in the active region. Furthermore, the direction of electrostatic field in the last barrier is reversed to along the drift direction of holes, which not only can lead to upbended conduction band to rise the barrier height for electron escape but also can accelerate holes to increase the hole injection current. As a result, electrons blocking and holes injection are enhanced, and in turn, the performance of the proposed LED is improved.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Charge carrier processes', 'Gallium nitride', 'Radiative recombination', 'Electrostatics', 'Aluminum gallium nitride']","['InGaN light-emitting diode (LED)', 'thickness-chirped barriers', 'efficiency droop', 'Crosslight']"

"A fiber optic vibration sensor using a fiber Bragg grating Fabry-Pérot interferometer with a wavelength-swept laser diode source, which works well for the case of small strain-amplitude vibration, exhibits inaccuracies in the interrogation caused by the nonlinearity of the wavelength modulation in the source when the strain amplitude due to vibration is large. With increasing the frequency of the wavelength sweep, the span of the wavelength sweep is reduced and the nonlinearity is pronounced. We experimentally characterize the nonlinearity, and by using a fiber Fabry-Pérot interferometer as a wavelength reference, we compensate it to enhance the accuracy of the interrogation for large strain-amplitude vibration. The proposed sensor achieves vibration measurement with a strain resolution of 0.3 nε/√{Hz} , measurement time of 10 μs, and maximum measurable value of 34 με at the wavelength-sweep frequency of 100 kHz under the present condition. The measurement time is limited by the capability of the laser diode driver, and the maximum measurable strain would be easily enhanced by increasing the wavelength-modulation current amplitude.","['Modulation', 'Fiber gratings', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical interferometry', 'Wavelength measurement', 'Strain']","['Fiber Bragg grating', 'optical fiber sensor', 'strain sensor', 'Fabry–Pérot interferometer']"

"Light-induced photoluminescence (PL) switching using azobenzene-doped liquid crystal (LC)-dispersed quantum dots (QDs) is demonstrated in a format of LC cell and LC-infiltrated tube. Before light irradiation, excitation photons undergo multiple scattering events before emission out of the LC cell, and PL intensity is high. Upon the light irradiation, the trans-to-cis photoisomerization of azobenzene makes the QD-dispersed LCs highly transparent, thus allowing most excitation photons to pass through LCs and decrease PL intensity. This demonstration may allow a new modulating technique for future development of light-switchable, QD-emission-based display or photonic devices.","['Radiation effects', 'Photonics', 'Optical imaging', 'Optical switches', 'Electron tubes', 'Optical scattering', 'Optical filters']","['Photonic materials', 'optical properties of photonic materials']"

"This work presents a new low-cost and environmentally friendly optical transducer based on surface scattering in a side-polished fiber mounted on a glass groove. The surface roughness caused by polishing is used to estimate the change in refractive index on top of the fiber. Changing the surrounding index affects the scattering properties and, consequently, the leakage of the guided mode. This effect is experimentally investigated through the change in the attenuation coefficient when the surrounding refractive index is changed by dropping different weight ratios of glucose solutions onto the polished side. The measured change of the attenuation coefficient is consistent with the finite-element calculations. The effect of different polished depths was theoretically investigated to optimize the working conditions.","['Optical fiber sensors', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Scattering', 'Optical surface waves']","['Fiber optics sensors', 'Nondestructive testing', 'Scattering measurements']"

"The effective plasma frequency in a photonic crystal (PC) is defined as the lowest frequency at which electromagnetic wave can start to propagate through the PC. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the effective plasma frequency fp , eff for a magnetized 1-D plasma PC (PPC). The PPC is made of two constituents, i.e., the plasma and the dielectric material like quartz. The effective plasma frequency in a PPC is obtained based on the calculated photonic band structure (PBS). It is found that fp , eff can be controlled by the externally applied static magnetic field, namely, fp , eff decreases significantly as the static magnetic field increases. This suggests that the plasma layer in a PPC shows a dielectric-like behavior when the magnetic field is applied. In addition, in the presence of static magnetic field, fp , eff will be increased as a function of electron density and thickness of the plasma layer. In the angular dependence of effective plasma frequency, we find that fp , eff is a decreasing function of angle of incidence in the absence of the static magnetic field. However, it becomes an increasing function of angle of incidence when the static magnetic field is applied. Finally, the effect of filling factor of the plasma layer is also illustrated.","['Plasmas', 'Magnetic fields', 'Photonic crystals', 'Permittivity', 'Dielectrics', 'Mathematical model', 'Photonics']","['Effective plasma frequency', 'plasma photonic crystal (PPC)', 'transfer matrix method (TMM)']"

"We present a method for improving the spatial resolution and the amplitude by an optimized deskew filter in long-range optical frequency-domain reflectometry (OFDR). In a previous deskew-filter method, as the nonlinear phase estimated from an auxiliary interferometer is used to compensate for the nonlinearity effect in the beating signals generated from a main OFDR interferometer, the spatial resolution and amplitude of the reflection peak in a long range (i.e, 80 km) are deteriorated by a residual nonlinearity effect due to the estimation inaccuracy of the nonlinear phase. In the proposed optimized deskew-filter method, the estimation accuracy of the nonlinear phase is improved by the higher orders of Taylor expansion and the high accuracy of the estimation of the time delay in the auxiliary interferometer using a cepstrum. We experimentally demonstrate that the amplitude of a reflection peak at 80 km increases by 20.5 dB and that the spatial resolution is up to 80 cm, which is about 187 times enhancement when compared with that of the same OFDR trace without nonlinearity compensation.","['Spatial resolution', 'Estimation', 'Taylor series', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Optical fiber filters', 'Optical fiber couplers', 'Optical interferometry']","['Tunable lasers', 'scattering', 'heterodyning', 'fiber optics systems']"

"A multiwavelength Brillouin-erbium fiber laser (MBEFL) temperature sensor with high and tunable sensitivity has been developed and experimentally demonstrated in this paper.

"When used for object tracking, the discriminative correlation filter (DCF) is effective, but its performance is often burdened by undesirable boundary effects. Meanwhile, when there is too much background information in training samples of the DCF, it will be easier to learn the area deviating from the tracking object. Further, illumination variation, partial/full occlusion, and appearance variations, render the response map aberrance of the correlation filter (CF) more prone to occur. To overcome these problems, an object tracking model based on a time-varying Spatio-temporal regularized correlation filter with aberrance repression is proposed in this paper. Firstly, by adding a regularized term to the traditional CFs to limit the change rate of the response map generated in the object detection phase, the proposed tracker can obviously repress the aberrance of the response maps; secondly, by adjusting the filter to the object regions suitable for tracking with high confidence scores with a time-varying spatial reliability map, the proposed tracker effectively overcomes the adverse effects caused by the boundary effect; and finally, by introducing a temporal regularized term, the proposed tracker also has superior tracking ability for the partial occluded objects and those with large appearance variations. Significant experiments on the OTB100, VOT2016, TC128, and UAV 123 datasets have revealed that the performance thereof outperformed many state-of-the-art trackers based on DCF and deep-based frameworks in terms of tracking accuracy, tracking success rate, and A-R rank, etc.","['Correlation', 'Object tracking', 'Feature extraction', 'Visualization', 'Training', 'Adaptation models', 'Information filters']","['Visual tracking', 'correlation filter', 'spatial reliability map', 'temporal regularized', 'aberrance repression']"

"Computing the permittivity and permeability of complex materials has previously relied on a series of simplifying assumptions to enable analysis. The most restricting requirement is that the optical axes of the material must align with the laboratory frame of reference. This requirement cannot be met for a large group of materials, including crystalline structures and metamaterials such as tilted nanorods. Currently, designing the optical characteristics of these structures would require ellipsometric analysis, which uses an error-correction-based technique. Here, a new technique built upon the underlying physics of ellipsometry is proposed to extract arbitrary permittivity and permeability tensors using a set of off-axis measurements. This new permittivity and permeability tensor extraction technique allows all 18 elements of the permittivity and permeability tensors to be nonzero and extracts them, given a set of reflectance and transmittance measurements. Several materials are analyzed here, including a) an isotopic plane of known permittivity, b) an anisotropic aligned structure, and c) a tilted-nanorod-based sample that cannot be measured using traditional methodologies. The isotropic plane shows very low error (<; 10 -4 %) in the x and y tensor measurements and around 1% error in the z tensor measurement at higher (metallic) permittivities. The aligned structure's characteristics are compared to measurements made with traditional techniques and show excellent agreement between the techniques. The tilted nanorod characteristics are analyzed and used to predict the reflection and transmission coefficients at other angles. The predictions compare very well with the computational electromagnetic simulations, showing at most 5% error over the range examined.","['Permittivity', 'Erbium', 'Permeability', 'Ellipsometry', 'Tensile stress', 'Metamaterials', 'Permittivity measurement']","['Electromagnetic metamaterials', 'computational electromagnetics', 'metamaterials']"

"The transmission resonance characteristics of a gold double-layered compound grating (DCG) are investigated numerically using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) method. The DCG is assumed to comprise two identical single-layered gratings separated by an air gap with a thickness of 0 ~ 250 mm. Furthermore, each grating is assumed to comprise two slits with different widths (w) within each period. The physical origins of the transmission features of the DCG structures are examined using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The RCWA results show that the optical transmission spectra of the considered DCG structures can be tailored over a wide range of wavelengths via a suitable adjustment of the air gap thickness. Moreover, it is shown that, for values of the air gap thickness greater than 100 nm, the transmission spectrum of the DCG structure converges toward that of a single-layered compound grating (SCG). Overall, the results presented in this paper show that the optical transmission properties of a metallic DCG are highly sensitive to the thickness of the air gap between the two grating structures. As such, DCG structures are ideally suited to the realization of proximity sensors and other photonic-based optical devices.","['Gratings', 'Gold', 'Compounds', 'Optical sensors', 'Finite difference methods', 'Photonics']","['Diffraction gratings', 'transmission', 'sensors']"

This will be a simple, time effective and low-cost technique for large scale engineering application. It is found that the fabricated fused silica SWS exhibited high performance broadband antireflective properties from 400nm to 1100nm wavelength range. We also investigate the period of SWS effects on far field transmittance by 3D-FDTD method. If the period is reduced below 220 nm, the far field transmittance equals total transmittance while maximum transmittance was obtained.","['Silicon compounds', 'Optical films', 'Optical reflection', 'Refractive index', 'Substrates', 'Diffraction', 'Optical device fabrication']","['Subwavelength structures', 'low-temperature thermal dewetting', 'effective medium theory', 'finite-difference time domains', 'optical properties']"
"We proposed a spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) expander for microwave photonic system based on distortion control. This work makes a significant contribution to the literature because the proposed SFDR expander can be applied on most of the previous linearity systems to further improve the SFDR. In addition, the proposed method is a broadband system. Further, we believe that this paper will be of interest to the readership of your journal because its novelty and potential applications.","['Optical attenuators', 'Holography', 'Holographic optical components', 'Optical imaging', 'Optical modulation', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical distortion']","['Microwave photonics', 'microwave photonics signal processing', 'dynamic range']"
"Synthetic garnet nanopowders of Y 3 Al 5 O 12 (YAG) and Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 (GGG) were produced, and the occurrence of a broadband bright visible emission by nominally undoped YAG and GGG and Cr 3+ doped GGG, depending on the environment pressure, as well as exciting on the pumping power, was demonstrated. The results indicate that high-intensity infrared laser irradiation in samples not only leads to heating (melting effects) but also produces visible broadband emission. Low pressure of the powders' environment favors the white light emission by lowering the threshold pumping power. A hypothesis on the nature of the emission is presented.","['Temperature measurement', 'Broadband communication', 'Garnets', 'Phosphors', 'Powders', 'Laser excitation']","['Garnets', 'nanocrystals', 'white light emission', 'laser diode excitation']"
"Carbon nanotubes possess appealing properties for terahertz (THz) applications. This work investigates the contribution of these properties in the context of THz photoconductive (PC) switches as THz detectors. The analysis engages the received THz electric field, the optical excitation, and the photocarrier dynamics of the carbon nanotube material through Drude-Smith theory and equivalent circuit model. Through this analysis, the effect of each parameter in the detected current can be investigated. Based on a realistic numerical assessment and comparison with our measurements for a conventional LT-GaAs PC switch, it is found that improvement in detected current is theoretically achievable, depending on the relative value of the imaginary photoconductivity of the CNT film. This is a parameter that can be varied through chemical treatment of the film. We found that, unlike the case of PC switches as THz emitting devices where a higher mobility is desired for higher output THz power, the detected current in the THz receiving PC switch is a nonmonotonic function of the mobility in the single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) film. The capabilities and limitations revealed in this study set guidelines for fabrication and optimization of more efficient carbon nanotube-based THz receiving PC switches. The study also addresses the fabrication process and challenges.","['Optical switches', 'Photoconductivity', 'Films', 'Integrated circuit modeling', 'Receivers', 'Optical pulses']","['Terahertz (THz)', 'photoconductive (PC) switch', 'photomixers', 'carbon nanotubes']"
"Mode-locked optical carriers with applicability for radio over free space optics (RoFSO) systems have been produced via a ring laser cavity incorporating an add/drop filter. This technique of generation allowed for servicing of a greater number of channels in a wavelength-division multiplexing RoFSO system, and the carriers were able to travel in a free space channel with very little dispersion. Sixteen carriers, having a free spectral range (FSR) of 12.5 GHz and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 250 MHz, were created. Eight of these 16 generated carriers were then separately modulated with eight orthogonal frequency-division multiplex signals and subsequently optically multiplexed and transmitted to a free space optic (FSO) channel using an FSO antenna. At the receiver side, the received signal was demultiplexed, and the performance of the system was analyzed via calculating the error vector magnitude and constellation diagram of the entire system.","['Optical fibers', 'Optical filters', 'Optical pulses', 'Wavelength division multiplexing', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Adaptive optics']","['Mode-locked laser pulse', 'Add/drop filter', 'Fiber laser loop']"
"We have proposed periodic L-shaped nanostructure arrays. The structure can exhibit strong and broad CD effect at oblique incidence. The CD effect can be conveniently tuned due to the strength of CD depend strongly on tilt angle at the same azimuthal rotation angle. In addition, the broad CD band can be tuned by changing the geometrical parameters of the structure.","['Plasmons', 'Surface waves', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic moments', 'Bandwidth', 'Broadband communication', 'Color']","['Circular dichroism', 'oblique incidence', 'surface plasmon']"

An compact silicon photonics coherent receiver (0.3X0.7mm2) co-integrated with low power consumption TIA (155mW/channel) is shown in this paper. The TIA is co-designed by taking the equivalent circuits of the balanced photodiodes (BDs) and interface parasitics into account and by providing an on-chip biasing and decoupling for the BDs. Operation below FEC threshold for both QPSK and 16QAM at 28Gbaud are obtained. For QPSK the OSNR penalty w.r.t. the theoretical limit was less than 2.5dB.,"['Receivers', 'Couplers', 'Transceivers', 'Silicon photonics', 'Power demand']","['Coherent receivers', 'silicon photonics', 'electronic–photonic cointegration']"
"We report a continuous-wave ultraviolet laser at 349 nm obtained by intracavity frequency doubling of a diode-pumped Pr 3+ -doped LiYF 4 laser. Power scaling of lasers at 698-nm fundamental wavelength was realized using an InGaN laser diode with a maximum output power of 850 mW and a 5-mm-long 0.5 a.t. % laser crystal. The maximum output power at 698 nm was 215 mW.
