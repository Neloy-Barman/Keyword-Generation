"Tissue palpation is one of the most popular techniques to detect tissue abnormalities in clinical scenarios, including breast examination. However, the tactile sensation used to identify tumors by the clinician or a woman during breast palpation makes this procedure subjective. Over the past decades, tactile sensors have been developed to quantitatively discriminate between cancerous and healthy tissues, but most of these systems still suffer from low force sensitivity, high power consumption, reduced sterilization durability, and electrical noise. This study aims to overcome these limitations by exploiting the advantages of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technology combined with the ones of 3-D printing to develop an innovative tactile probe for breast cancer identification. FBGs have already been proposed for tissue palpation in minimally invasive surgery via tactile sensing, while their application in superficial palpation is still overlooked. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first work in which the FBG integration into 3-D-printed structures is proposed for breast superficial palpation. Here, we first focused on the sensing unit design optimization via finite-element analysis, fabrication, and metrological characterization. Then, the final prototype of the tactile probe integrating multiple identical sensing units was fabricated, and the results of tests on silicone samples with different hardness and on a phantom mimicking breast tissue with an early stage tumor were discussed. The promising findings will guide further optimization of the tactile probe design to improve system spatial resolution, reduce its encumbrance, and provide feedback to the user for applications on patients.",[],[]
"We investigate a coupled multiscale 3-D finite-element model consisting of an orthogonal array of thin-film cantilever magnetoelectric (ME) magnetic field sensors and a simplified human head model. Electric point dipole sources are placed inside the head to generate an electromagnetic field. This field propagates through the tissue layers and outside of the head, where it reaches the sensor array. The investigated sensors are based on a 300-μm-thick silicon substrate layer of 26.25 mm length and 2.45 mm width, with a 20-μm-thick aluminum nitride (AlN) layer and a 20-μm-thick FeCoSiB layer as piezoelectric (PE) and magnetostrictive materials, respectively, located on opposite sides of the substrate. We position three sensors orthogonally to obtain a vector field sensor. The head model is based on the three-shell approach and consists of concentric spheres representing white matter, skull, and skin. All three layers are assigned specific conductivity and relative permittivity values from the literature, aiming to approximate the propagation of electromagnetic fields through different tissue types. We observe the propagation of an electric field generated by the dipole source and subsequent induction of a magnetic field inside the head structure, propagating outwards to the sensor array, where the generated voltage in the PE layer is evaluated for different ME sensor array and source positions and orientations. We show different behaviors of the sensors for a dipole source inside the head tissue versus a simple air environment, highlighting the benefits in accuracy and specificity of a combined head and sensor model with realistic material parameters.","['Sensors', 'Magnetic sensors', 'Magnetic heads', 'Sensor arrays', 'Brain modeling', 'Mathematical models', 'Solid modeling']","['Biomagnetic sensing', 'finite-element method (FEM)', 'human head model', 'magnetic field measurement', 'magnetoelectric (ME) effects', 'magnetostrictive (MS) device', 'multiferroic', 'multiscale model']"
"The lighthouse localization system has recently been developed and used for localization in virtual reality (VR). Not only for VR but also for a general indoor positioning systems (IPSs) it has several advantages over existing methods, including low cost, wide detection area, and easy setup. Here, we adopt the stereo configuration of a lighthouse for improved sensing performance and propose a novel calibration method for stereo configuration. For the stereo calibration, the exact positions of sufficient corresponding points in two sensor coordinates need to be determined. A printed checkerboard is widely used for stereo camera systems because it is easy to construct and its accuracy is guaranteed owing to its printing accuracy. However, in the case of the lighthouse system, it is very difficult or impossible to construct a highly accurate calibration board similar to the checkerboard mainly because of manufacturing errors. In this study, we use a receiver sensor and a two-axis linear stage equipped with micrometers. By moving predetermined distances along the x and y directions on the linear stage, we can obtain multiple-point information with high accuracy, which can then be used for the stereo calibration of two lighthouses. In this paper, the calibration and pose estimation procedures are described in detail, and the pose estimation result of the perspective-n-points method is compared with that of the triangulation method. Finally, the pose estimation accuracy of the proposed system is compared with that of a commercial system that is widely used for highly accurate medical applications.","['Calibration', 'Pose estimation', 'Photodiodes', 'Sensors', 'Location awareness', 'Synchronization', 'Cameras']","['Base station', 'calibration', 'lighthouse', 'pose estimation', 'virtual reality']"
"The article proposes a fully printed microelectrode array (MEA) as a proof of concept for the feasibility of a customized and low-cost bioelectronic device. The target application is to promote the maturation of the cell culture by providing biophysical stimuli and evaluating the functionality of the bioengineered products, monitoring in real-time the electrogenic cell action potential. The MEA is entirely printed with aerosol jet printing (AJP) with a multilayer structure composed of an array of 16 electrodes. AJP fabrication was exploited as low-cost technique and easy and reliable possibility to print both insulated material and conductive polymer. Furthermore, the technique allows the realization of a customized electrode design according to specific neuronal network architecture. The chosen inks achieve the requirements for the intended use, in terms of high conductivity for electrodes, low conductivity for passivation layers, and biocompatibility for cell culture. Results from geometrical characterization showed an agreement with the design requirements. In particular, the first prototypes showed a thickness of the passivation layer of (33.4 ± 1.4)μmand the silver conductive tracks with a thickness of (5.5 ± 0.6)μmand a width of (68 ± 1.4)μm. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy established an impedance magnitude value significantly below compared with commercial MEA and inkjet printing MEA. The reusability and the stability of the sensor are demonstrated within two weeks. Overall, the results suggest the possibility to exploit the potential to print MEA onto platform, for in vitro cell culture and to integrate other types of biosensors.","['Electrodes', 'Computer architecture', 'Microprocessors', 'Sensors', 'Recording', 'Action potentials', 'Ink']","['Additive manufacturing (AM)', 'aerosol jet printing (AJP)', 'biomedical application', 'biosensor', 'in vitro cell culture', 'microelectrode array (MEA)', 'printed sensor']"
"In order to increase the spatiotemporal resolution and accessibility of freshwater and marine data, low-cost in situ fluorometers are required. The devices must be robust, fully submersible, and sensitive in the 1 ppb–1 ppm range for compounds such as Rhodamine water tracer (RWT), a dye used in time of travel, and substance dispersal measurements. In this work, we introduce a deployment-ready, low-cost, small form-factor RWT fluorometer prototype based on the principle of lock-in amplification. Using measurements collected from remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) deployments during a dye-tracer experiment in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, we compare its performance against that of a widely used commercial fluorometer. The results of the prototype’s calibration and deployment show competitive performance against commercial instruments, with a limit of detection (LOD) below 0.2 ppb and for a cost of U.S.$744.70, a fraction of the cost of relevant commercially available in situ fluorometers.","['Optical filters', 'Underwater vehicles', 'Prototypes', 'Fluorescence', 'Lenses', 'Optics', 'Costs']","['Chlorophyll', 'fluorometer', 'harmful algal bloom (HAB)', 'lock-in amplifier', 'low cost', 'Rhodamine', 'sensor']"
"This research addresses the long-term measurement of environmental data in geographically remote areas and an energy-optimized method of storing data on a storage medium. For this purpose, we have developed our measurement module Advanced Data Logger (ADL). In terms of connectivity, the module operates in three modes: 1) offline—when measured data is primarily stored on the storage medium; 2) Internet of Things (IoT) ready—measured data is stored on the storage medium and sent to the remote server in defined batches; and 3) online mode—when measured data is preferably sent to the remote server immediately after measurement. The design aims to minimize the module’s power consumption so that the autonomous operating time is close to one year. As part of the design, the Simple File System (simpleFS) software module is designed for the role of a simple file system (FS) optimized to minimize I/O operations. Its other feature in data storage is the automatic normalization of the data transmitted from the attached sensors. The last part of the design is the AdlReader software solution, used to configure the hardware (HW) module and to retrieve the measured data files. We verified the correct operation of the ADL module along with nine sensors built in a vertical soil temperature profile probe in experimental installation and operation for two months. According to the requirements for our solution, the expected operation time of the ADL module is 9–12 months.","['Sensors', 'Power demand', 'Temperature measurement', 'Microcontrollers', 'Memory management', 'Internet of Things', 'Hardware', 'Energy consumption', 'File systems']","['Data logger', 'energy consumption', 'file system (FS)', 'memory', 'microcontroller', 'optimization', 'sensor']"
"Since hundreds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by cell metabolism and released into the blood are excreted through exhaled breath or body fluids, the volatile composition (volatilome) of human samples reflects a subject’s state of health and early signals any abnormal deviation from healthy to disease. The chemical volatilomic profile of biological matrices can be transduced in a digital fingerprint by low cost and easy-to-use electronic nose (e-nose) devices based on gas sensor arrays. The e-noses can be used to aid clinical diagnosis supporting conventional diagnostic methods that sometimes require expensive or invasive medical procedures and delays in diagnoses. In this paper, an e-nose devoted to the human volatilome fingerprinting is presented. The device, code-named SPYROX, adopts an array of 8 metal-oxide (MOX) gas sensors and it is able to analyze response signals from different matrices (multi-matrix samples), dealing with exhaled breath and headspace analysis of human biological samples. While other works in literature neglect the design of the interface circuit, here an optimal multi-ranged analog front-end (AFE) circuit is proposed. It aims to the optimization of the read-out sensitivity which, ultimately, leads to accurate training datasets and, consequently, to high classification scores. Finally, the efficacy of the device is proved by testing both chemical standards and mixtures. As a result, a classification accuracy of 100% is achieved with a linear discriminant model. The experimental results give a proof on the system’s efficacy to the fingerprint analysis of complex gas mixtures, which are typical of human volatilome.","['Sensors', 'Sensor arrays', 'Gas detectors', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Cancer', 'Fingerprint recognition', 'Voltage']","['electronic nose', 'sensor systems and applications', 'chemical sensors', 'biomedical electronics', 'analog front-end']"
"An important aspect of mechanical ventilation is the recognition and quantification of spontaneous respiratory effort. However, a measurement of flows and pressures often used for this purpose is prone to error. A promising alternative is to detect diaphragmatic contractions, directly. A method recently proposed is to acquire the diaphragm electromyography (EMG) signals using surface electrodes. However, this method is often limited by disturbances and electrode placements for some applications in which the patient is moving, such as rehabilitation or breathing training. In this work, we present a novel noninvasive method that addresses these problems. This method is based on a novel dry electrode belt, which can be used to comfortably derive EMG signals from the thorax, in combination with a developed electrical measurement system. The modular multichannel system is capable of simultaneously deriving and digitizing 32 differential EMG channels and sending them to a personal computer (PC). A specific digital signal processing chain allows combining the data into one robust overall signal. In addition, the signals derived from the thorax can be used to obtain information regarding the spatiotemporal propagation of the diaphragm EMG. To verify the functionality, the system is characterized. Subsequently, subject measurements are performed. From these, the spatiotemporal propagation of diaphragm EMG on the thorax can be identified. For better visualization, this propagation is graphically displayed in a 3-D model. In addition, it is shown how the combination of all signals can be used to obtain a robust overall signal that can be used to control ventilators.","['Electromyography', 'Electrodes', 'Belts', 'Frequency measurement', 'Muscles', 'Ventilators', 'Ventilation']","['Dry electrodes', 'electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi)', 'electrode belt', 'electromyography', 'diaphragmatic electromyography (EMGdi)', 'measurement system', 'multichannel', 'respiration monitoring', 'spatiotemporal electromyography (EMG)']"
"Assistive technology (AT) helps to assess the daily living of frail people and may have a strategic role to detect and prevent falls. In this article, the task of classifying different classes of postural sway behaviors has been addressed by developing a neuro-fuzzy (NF) inference approach that is robust against noise. The proposed approach classifies four different postural behaviors, namely, stable standing (ST), anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral, and unstable (UNST). The strategy exploits data generated by a wearable sensor node, to be positioned on the user chest. A dedicated experimental setup has been realized to emulate the postural dynamics and generate the dataset. Two novel indices to assess the robustness of the system have been proposed. The first index is a measure of residuals between the predicted and the expected postural status, which equally weights estimations with respect to expected classes. The second metric is a reliability index, which allows for assessing the degree of trust of each estimation performed by the NF inference. Results obtained demonstrate the suitability of the proposed methodology, showing a capability of almost 100% to correctly classify patterns among different allowed classes, with reliability indexes of 97.56% and 98.50% for the training and test patterns, respectively. Also, the robustness of the NF classification algorithm against noisy data has been demonstrated.","['Sensors', 'Behavioral sciences', 'Monitoring', 'Noise measurement', 'Classification algorithms', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Robustness']","['Inertial unit', 'neuro-fuzzy (NF) inference', 'postural sway behavior classification', 'system assessment']"
"Trifurcated optical fiber displacement sensors (OFDS) are increasingly used in industrial and aerospace applications. The critical element of the sensor is the fiber bundle. However, there is no straightforward method to calculate it from the working specifications of the sensor, the number of fibers needed, their size, and arrangement. This work presents a simple yet accurate method to design trifurcated OFDSs. The proposed method allows to derive the geometrical arrangement and size of the fibers from three simple equations, thus reducing significantly the difficulty and complexity of the OFDS design. Those three equations depend on the working point, working range, required sensitivity, and maximum size of the bundle. In this way, the proposed method will save valuable time for researchers and engineers who wish to design, fabricate, and use this type of OFDSs. The procedure is explained in detail with two examples. The results predicted by the model are compared with the experimental results of a bundle with identical fiber arrangement and dimensions. The results show good agreement with a deviation of less than 1% in the working range of the sensor.","['Optical fiber sensors', 'Optical fibers', 'Sensors', 'Mathematical models', 'Photodiodes', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Turbines']","['Design', 'fiber bundle', 'fiber optic sensors', 'intensity modulated optical sensor', 'optical fiber displacement sensor', 'method', 'trifurcated']"
"An ultra-wide band measurement method for determining the complex refractive index of large-volume objects is presented. The method is intended for industrial non-destructive testing. It uses a frequency-domain technique in which transmitted radio pulses are analyzed and the effects of near field and coupling on the determined refractive index are compensated. Measurements were performed in an industrial setup with electromagnetic sensors buried in the object. The results are presented for woodchips as an object. The refractive index was experimentally determined in the frequency range 0.5-3.0 GHz. Additionally, we designed and manufactured planar quasi-differential elliptical-antennas as electromagnetic sensors. The results from the industrial measurement setup were compared with the results of the laboratory setup, in which the sensors were placed outside the test box and near field and coupling effects could be neglected. The complex refractive index determined for the two setups was in good agreement, which corroborates the proposed method for compensating for coupling and near-field effects. The complex refractive index of woodchips changes with the moisture content. It is experimental verified using the industrial setup that the moisture content can be determined with a 2 percent error.","['Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Refractive index', 'Sensor systems', 'Moisture', 'Couplings', 'Antenna radiation patterns', 'Testing']","['Complex refractive index', 'non-destructive testing', 'UWB radar sensor', 'moisture', 'wood-based material', 'radio-link system', 'EM sensor', 'woodchips', 'near field coupling', 'radio measurement']"
"The design, development and analysis of a planar microstrip sensor operating at 2.4 GHz for the detection of adulteration in liquid samples is presented. The sensor characterises the samples based on the material properties which in turn affects the electric field fringing from the sensing area. In particular, a closed loop microstrip antenna is developed and used for the sensing application. The sensor is designed and analysed using simulation software and the fabricated prototype is experimentally validated. Parametric analysis of the design variables and mathematical modelling of the sensor operations are carried out by analysing the fields generated within the sensor. A case study for adulteration testing is carried out by choosing milk as the sample. Qualitative and quantitative testing using the milk as sample has been carried out experimentally under different test conditions. For quantitative testing, water is added to milk as the adulterant and for qualitative testing, usual chemical adulterants that are mixed with milk are added and the variations in operating frequency and return loss are analysed. From the analysis it could be observed that the shift in the operating frequency and return loss are dependent on the changes in dielectric permittivity of the sample loaded on to the sensor surface. From this analysis, the adulteration rate in milk can be estimated based on the variation in permittivity of the adulterant that is added to the milk. The same procedure can be extended in detecting the adulteration of any liquid samples.","['Sensors', 'Dairy products', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Coplanar waveguides', 'Antennas', 'Testing', 'Liquids']","['Adulteration', 'Loop Antenna', 'Microstrip', 'Microwave', 'Sensor']"
"Several unmanned retail stores have been introduced with the development of sensors, wireless communication, and computer vision technologies. A vision-based kiosk that is only equipped with a vision sensor has significant advantages such as compactness and low implementation cost. Using convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detectors, the kiosk recognizes an object when a customer picks up a product. In retail object recognition, the key challenge is the limited number of detections and high interclass similarity. In this study, these challenges are addressed by utilizing the “view-specific” feature of an object; specifically, an object class is divided into multiple “view-based” subclasses, and the object detectors are trained using these data. Further, the “view-aware feature” is defined by aggregating subclass detection results from multiple cameras. A superclass classifier predicts a superclass by utilizing an informative subclass detection result that distinguishes the target object from other similar-looking objects. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a prototype of the vision-based unmanned kiosk system is implemented. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method, even on a state-of-the-art detection network. The dataset used in this study has been subsequently provided in the IEEE DataPort for reproducibility.","['Cameras', 'Feature extraction', 'Detectors', 'Sensors', 'Annotations', 'Object recognition', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization']","['Multicamera system', 'retail product recognition', 'unmanned retail', 'vending machine']"

"The breath-by-breath measurement of respiratory rate (RR) plays a pivotal role in sports and exercise. The accurate estimation of RR values on a breath-by-breath basis with wearable sensors has several open challenges during training, including motion artifacts and other breathing-unrelated events. This article presents a novel method based on a signal quality index (SQI) for identifying and excluding unreliable breaths from breathing waveforms. The method analyses the morphological characteristics of the respiratory signal, comparing each breath with an average breath template calculated as an average of all individual breaths. The comparison is made using a template matching without the need of a reference signal. Experimental tests have been carried out at rest and during walking, running, and cycling activities to assess the method’s performance in estimating breath-by-breath RR by comparison with reference values collected with a flowmeter. The comparison between the RR values has been performed with an ad hoc developed method able to accomplish this task, even when the number of breaths identified by the two devices is different. The obtained results showed that our SQI-based method improves the accuracy of RR estimation by reducing the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values in all the tested conditions (18.5%, 22.2%, 2.8%, and 14.1% of MAPE improvement rate during rest, walking, running and cycling, respectively). Pilot tests during high-intensity interval training (HIIT) also demonstrated a 30.7% MAPE improvement rate. The promising findings demonstrated that using SQI-based algorithms can lead to more accurate RR estimations during exercise by using comfortable wearable sensors.","['Sensors', 'Sports', 'Estimation', 'Monitoring', 'Performance evaluation', 'Biomedical monitoring', 'Indexes', 'Respiratory system']","['Respiratory rate (RR)', 'sensors', 'signal quality index (SQI)', 'template matching', 'wearable device']"
"Pulse oximeters are electronic devices that provide the values of two physiological parameters: heart rate, HR, and functional O 2 saturation, SpO 2 . Acquiring this information requires a photodiode and a set of red and infrared light-emitting diodes to generate two plethysmograms, which are digitally processed to find the HR and SpO 2 values. The circuits currently used to generate these plethysmograms require multiple analog modules, such as voltage references, transimpedance amplifiers, voltage amplifiers, and comparators. Analog-to-digital converters or switched integrators are also needed to digitalize the signals that provide the HR and SpO 2 values when introduced in a Digital Processor, DP. This article proposes a new circuit that eliminates the need for all these analog modules or converters, replacing them with a single capacitor and two resistors. The circuit is based on a light-to-time-to-digital conversion performed using the DP, which does not require any special characteristics to carry out this task. As a proof of concept, the new design has been implemented using an FPGA as the DP. The results show plethysmograms with good detail regarding amplitude and time, allowing the device to be used for clinical purposes. A comparison with two conventional commercial pulse oximeters shows that the new circuit provides similar HR and SpO 2 values.","['Pulse oximeter', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Pins', 'Photodiodes', 'Heart rate', 'Capacitors', 'Field programmable gate arrays']","['Pulse oximetry', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Light-to-Time-to-Digital', 'Direct Interface Circuit']"
"This article proposes an optical-based tactile sensor design concept, which uses a light angle and intensity sensor to infer force and displacement from deformations of a silicone pillar. The proposed design uses a simple, low-cost fabrication method with an overall small-scale form factor. The sensor can measure 3-D displacement, 3-D force, and vibration. The overall displacement estimation error [mean ± standard deviation (SD)] in theX-,Y-, andZ-axes was−10.8±52.1, 15.4 ± 66.5, and 1.8±17.6μm, respectively, over a full-scale lateral displacement of 1-mm radius inXandYand 2.2-mm compression inZ.

Sensitivity to vibrations in the range of 10–950 Hz was also evaluated showing good sensitivity over this entire range.

"Six-axis force/torque (F/T) sensors have been actively developed owing to the increasing demand for force control and monitoring in many engineering applications. However, these sensors are expensive and complicated to use, particularly the wireless ones. This study presents a user-friendly and economical wireless six-axis F/T sensor for force control and monitoring applications. A newly designed elastic structure was used to overcome the reliability degradation and high machining cost problems of the elastic structures developed in our previous study. T-shaped structures were arranged symmetrically around the upper and lower parts, reducing the manufacturing cost. The electrical and electronic circuits for economical analog/digital signal processing, including zero calibration, were developed based on cheap microcontrollers. A user-friendly embedded wireless communication module was programmed at a low machine level for fast force control and monitoring.

"Accurate displacement measurement is critical for many applications. Recently, a variety of radio frequency-based linear displacement sensing techniques were introduced. However, the application of the previously proposed techniques was either not fully demonstrated toward realizing the sensor and/or they were limited in measurement range to less than 4 cm. This article introduces a fully characterized wide-range radio frequency-based contactless linear displacement sensor. The sensor consists of a short-circuited 50-Ωmicrostrip line and a movable current-sensing resonant probe. The probe accurately measures the sinusoidal magnetic field distribution along the short-circuited transmission line from a certain distance above it. The measured normalized field values are mapped to displacement using the inverse of the sinusoidal function in the postprocessing stage. The proposed technique is comprehensively validated using simulations and measurements of a compact sensor prototype operating at 727.5 MHz. Furthermore, the merits of the proposed sensor compared to the widely accepted linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) displacement transducer are highlighted here. The metrological characterization of the proposed sensor shows that it offers a very wide dynamic range of 68 mm with a standard deviation of the estimation error of less than 0.09 mm (0.13% of the full range). It is also demonstrated that the proposed sensor outperforms the commercial LVDT transducer in terms of overall displacement measurement accuracy. In general, the proposed sensor is scalable and has a theoretical dynamic range ofλ/2 making it suitable for a wide range of applications.","['Magnetic sensors', 'Transmission line measurements', 'Probes', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Power transmission lines', 'Magnetic field measurement', 'Magnetic fields']","['Current sensor', 'displacement sensor', 'magnetic field distribution', 'microstrip line', 'microwave', 'radio frequency', 'resonant loop', 'short circuited']"
"When assessing fruit ripeness, multispectral sensors offer a cheaper alternative to high-resolution spectroscopy. Additionally, they provide a more robust solution to environmental factors, in contrast to multi-spectral cameras. However, the low spectral resolution of multispectral devices proposed in the literature may not be sufficient to discriminate with acceptable accuracy a high number of different ripeness classes with machine learning techniques. Moreover, meaningful features to be given as input to the classification models are generally hand-crafted on the basis of the fruit to be evaluated, making the devices not versatile across other fruit categories. This paper aims at overcoming these limitations, by introducing a multispectral device for in-situ fruit-ripening evaluation that is i) affordable for a wide range of end-users, ii) robust to environmental factors, iii) capable of automatically finding the most meaningful features depending on the fruit categories to evaluate and iv) capable of discriminating a high number of fruit ripeness classes with high accuracy. The device integrates a broadband LED and a VIS-NIR multispectral sensor to gather information about the fruit’ ripeness levels through predictive machine learning algorithms. The proposed device was trained on a dataset of 450 spectral measurements acquired from tomatoes at six different ripeness stages. The results demonstrated the high capability of the proposed approach to recognize the tomatoes’ ripeness levels (average accuracy of 93.72%).","['Sensors', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Cameras', 'Lighting', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Hardware', 'Costs']","['Optoelectronic sensors', 'Light-emitting diodes', 'Integrated Optics Sensors', 'Environmental Monitoring and Control']"
"Affordance segmentation is used to split object images into parts according to the possible interactions, usually to drive safe robotic grasping. Most approaches to affordance segmentation are computationally demanding; this hinders their integration into wearable robots, whose compact structure typically offers limited processing power. This article describes a design strategy for tiny, deep neural networks (DNNs) that can accomplish affordance segmentation and deploy effectively on microcontroller-like processing units. This is attained by specialized, hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS). The method was validated by assessing the performance of several tiny networks, at different levels of complexity, on three benchmark datasets. The outcome measure was the accuracy of the generated affordance maps and the associated spatial object descriptors (orientation, center of mass, and size). The experimental results confirmed that the proposed method compared satisfactorily with the state-of-the-art approaches, yet allowing a considerable reduction in both network complexity and inference time.

"Structural damage identification (SDI) is of paramount importance for ensuring the long-term safety and effectiveness of various structures. However, existing identification methods require careful selection of sensors, especially in terms of sensor combination optimization, which necessitates meticulous evaluation. Herein, we propose a novel approach for detecting structural damage from vibrational signals in planar steel frames, aiming to address and improve upon the current limitations. Our method first extracts relevant vibration signals from multiple joints and then replaces the vibration signal of the damaged joint with the signal difference between the damaged and undamaged joints. This innovative approach effectively highlights the features of structural damage for further analysis. Utilizing statistical analysis, we evaluate sensor performance based on mean, standard deviation, and scatter plots, obviating the need for meticulous sensor selection. Furthermore, by analyzing the robustness exhibited by sensor combinations and confirming their stability to a certain extent, we utilize a one-dimensional fusion convolutional neural network with a signal difference (1D-FCNND) composed of individual convolutional layers using 1-D traditional and separable convolution techniques to detect structural damage accurately and efficiently. We validate the practical application of our method using benchmark data from the Qatar University Grandstand Simulator (QUGS). The results demonstrate a significant reduction in sensor requirements, accounting for only 13.33% of the total required sensors while achieving a notable enhancement of 98.92% in accuracy using only five 1D-FCNND models. The simplicity and robustness of our method enhance identification performance and optimize sensor utilization, making it a practical and promising solution for structural health monitoring (SHM) and damage identification in various engineering structures.

"This study provides a comprehensive characterization of a 4×4 piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (PMUT) array suited for in-air applications. Crosstalk can be viewed as a lack of isolation among the transducers, with possible reasons, including the electrical, acoustic, and structural coupling among the transducers. This study focuses on acoustic coupling as the primary cause of crosstalk, since the influence of electrical and structural coupling on crosstalk is shown to be negligible by comparing experimental tests and numerical analysis conducted in vacuum and in air. It is expected that acoustic coupling among diaphragms occurs due to air-connected cavities. Consequently, several scenarios are investigated in which the cavities are either partially or completely acoustically disconnected. The computed response spectra of the PMUTs demonstrate that the presence of secondary peaks, which indicated the presence of crosstalk, is diminished when the PMUTs are decoupled partially or completely as compared with an open cavity. The conducted acoustic tests also demonstrated that crosstalk impacts the intensity and directivity of the acoustic wave produced by the array.","['Crosstalk', 'Transducers', 'Residual stresses', 'Acoustics', 'Silicon', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Numerical simulation']","['Acoustic–structure interaction', 'array', 'crosstalk', 'finite-element analysis (FEA)', 'multiphysics modeling', 'piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs)', 'piezoelectricity', 'ultrasound']"
"For high-impact devices, subsequent vibrations have as much influence on the deterioration of the mechanical structure as the impact itself. To mitigate the consequences of both impacts and resulting vibrations, it is crucial to accurately understand the peak acceleration and vibration frequencies that originate in the structure.

This method of measurement is chosen due to the viability of placing the readout electronics far from the highly radioactive environment that the sensor may be installed in. The designed accelerometer consists of a fixed aluminum frame with a built-in membrane that acts as a leaf spring. In the same membrane, a retro-reflector is attached which acts as a seismic mass. The retro-reflector reflects the light beam coming from the collimator lens placed on the frame. To prove its viability, the device has been tested under different conditions. First, the device is calibrated and validated using a high-frequency exciter. Second, a high-acceleration testbench is used to compare its output signal with a commercial accelerometer and verify its proper operation as well as its expected lifetime. The experimental results showed an average sensitivity of9×10−4g/pm with reading measurements of up to 5000 g and a working bandwidth located between 50 and 800 Hz.","['Sensors', 'Accelerometers', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical interferometry', 'Vibrations', 'Temperature measurement', 'Laser beams']","['Accelerometer', 'bandwidth', 'finite element modeling', 'high impact', 'inertial sensor', 'radioactive hazard']"
"Techniques for automatic modulation classification (AMC) of radar signals are crucial for spectrum sensing, passive bistatic radars, and electronic intelligence (ELINT). Most of the existing AMC algorithms were evaluated using solely synthetic data. Meanwhile, signals intercepted in real-life scenarios are extra distorted due to the multipath propagation. This article presents the novel, pattern recognition AMC method for frequency-modulated radar signals, with improved resistance to noise and multipath. This has been achieved by a multistage feature selection process, involving over a dozen of popular radar signal metrics. Based on the feature selection results, the two advanced waveform features were utilized in the designed algorithm, i.e., quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) instantaneous frequency (IF) estimate and fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) profile. The proposed AMC method has been evaluated using both synthetic and real data. The obtained results show that proposed classification framework achieves an overall accuracy of 93.6% for a set of real-life signals acquisitions, corrupted both by noise and multipath influence.","['Radar', 'Feature extraction', 'Sensors', 'Modulation', 'Classification algorithms', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Signal processing algorithms']","['Automatic modulation classification (AMC)', 'automatic modulation recognition (AMR)', 'electronic intelligence (ELINT)', 'machine learning', 'modulation recognition', 'multipath', 'radar signal']"
"Camouflaged object detection (COD) is a typical application of deep-coupled unmanned platform combat support which aims to detect objects that are highly similar to the background in terms of structure, details, and texture while improving the efficiency and accuracy of detecting camouflaged objects. Existing COD methods are built upon extraction and segmentation of image features and lack of theoretical interpretability. In this paper, the task of COD was revisited and analyzed. From the perspective of cognition, the cognitive laws of camouflaged objects were assessed through eye movement experiments to form an entire cognitive process, which serves as a guide for designing COD methods. Feature extraction, position attention, and channel attention modules were utilized as the basic framework. The residual-in-residual module was introduced to improve the accuracy of feature learning and transmission. Then a bidirectional attention module was added to guide the feedforward and feedback of attention features. And a closed loop was formed to achieve efficient feature transmission and use. As a result, the performance of our method BiCOD was promoted. In addition, a COD dataset containing both natural and artificial camouflage objects was compiled to evaluate the generalization ability of the camouflaged object recognition algorithm. The experiment results showed that BiCOD achieved an advanced level in quantitative results and visual comparisons in general, and the effectiveness and accuracy of the method in different environments were verified.","['Feature extraction', 'Visualization', 'Computational modeling', 'Task analysis', 'Object recognition', 'Object detection', 'Frequency-domain analysis']","['Cognition', 'Attention', 'Camouflaged Object Detection']"
"Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, wearable devices featuring oxygen-saturation measurements have gradually attracted public attention. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has, however, raised doubts about the accuracy of watch-type oximeters (e.g., Apple Watch and Fitbit Sense) for darker-skinned users. That is, the accuracy of oxygen-saturation measurements is affected by skin tone. Accordingly, this article proposes a method of calibrating the bias of the oxygen-saturation measurement caused by differences in skin tone. We integrate a color sensor into a wearable device featuring the function of oxygen-saturation measurement. We also use the individual typology angle (ITA) to quantify the user’s skin color and the skin’s ITA quantization value to calibrate the oxygen saturation value of the pulse oximeter sensor. The oxygen-saturation-calibration algorithm of the ITA-quantified value is suitable for determining theR-value bias caused by skin color. Our experimental findings derive from testing theR-values of subjects with different skin colors and simulating and verifying oxygen saturation ranges from 70% to 100%. The findings suggest that it is possible for the oxygen saturation bias of darker-skinned subjects to be reduced from anArmserror of 5.44% to anArmserror of 0.82%; that is, using ITA-quantified value for calibration, the accuracy of oxygen saturation measurements (OSMs) has been significantly improved. The proposed method enables the oxygen-saturation measurements of dark-skinned subjects to comply with the FDA guidance and ISO 80601-2-61:2017 standards, meaning that this study’s method can effectively improve the accuracy of the oxygen-saturation measurements of watch-type oximeters.","['Skin', 'Image color analysis', 'Sensors', 'Wearable computers', 'Quantization (signal)', 'Color', 'Calibration']","['Color sensor', 'individual typology angle (ITA)', 'oxygen saturation calibration algorithm', 'oxygen saturation measurement (OSM)', 'skin color', 'watch-type oximeters']"
"Monitoring of heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (fR)is fundamental to assessing the health status of an individual. To address this scope, technologies that frame the upper body and the face regions of a subject without any physical contact can be used. Motion artifacts can affect the applicability of non-contact methods to the continuous monitoring of these parameters as well as the computational burden. This article focuses on a technique based on images captured with a single digital camera for the continuous estimation of HR andfR. The main goal is to analyze how the velocity of facial movements and region of interest (ROI) tracking duration influence the performance of the method. Tests were performed on healthy volunteers during motionless trials (i.e., at rest and after exercise), head and torso movements, and during physical exercise. Results demonstrated that a continuous estimation of HR andfRcan be performed with acceptable errors under changing ROI tracking duration and velocity in motionless trials (mean absolute error (MAE) below 5 bpm and 3.42 breaths⋅min−1for HR andfR, respectively), whereas during movements (mimicking head and torso movements, and during exercise) the error increases (MAE up to 5.42 bpm and up to 5.03 breaths⋅min−1for HR andfR, respectively). The proposed investigation can provide a framework for the continuous estimation of HR andfRduring both static and dynamic activities by optimizing the ROI tracking duration under different velocities of facial movements.","['Estimation', 'Tracking', 'Faces', 'Heart rate', 'Sensors', 'Monitoring', 'Torso']","['Digital camera', 'heart rate (HR) monitoring', 'motion assessment', 'region of interest (ROI) tracking', 'respiratory rate (fR) monitoring']"
"Piezoresistive (PZ) materials are frequently employed for the fabrication of wired strain sensors by exploiting the variation of the surface resistance observed when a mechanical stimulus is applied. However, this variation is measured by electrodes connected to the sheet. In this work, we propose to extract the strain information from the PZ material by using a completely wireless approach. The sensor is based on a resonant absorbing structure working at 7.39 GHz that exploits the interaction between an unstretchable metasurface and the PZ material used as ground plane. When the PZ sheet is stretched, a variation of the reflection coefficient at the resonance frequency is observed because of the sheet resistance variation. Differently from other chipless strain sensors based on stretchable substrates which are based on a deformation of the metallic pattern under applied strain, here, the strain is only applied to the PZ material. The proposed passive wireless sensor has been thoroughly modeled through a transmission line (TL) approach to clarify the physical mechanism that induces the scattering modulation. Finally, experimental results that verify the proposed strain sensing approach are presented. The experiments have been carried out several times to evaluate the measurement uncertainty. A sensor sensitivity of 0.5 dB/% has been estimated. The proposed approach considerably simplifies the realization of passive wireless strain sensors as it is not required to print resonators on stretchable substrates with ad hoc manufacturing processes, but it is sufficient to employ commercially available stretchable shielding materials.","['Sensors', 'Capacitive sensors', 'Strain', 'Piezoresistance', 'Wireless communication', 'Wireless sensor networks', 'Ad hoc networks']","['Electromagnetic absorber', 'frequency selective surfaces (FSSs)', 'metasurfaces', 'stacked patch antennas', 'strain sensors', 'stretchable materials', 'wireless sensors']"
"A droplet electrical generator (DG) is an energy harvester able to scavenge energy from water droplets sliding on its surface. A compact electrical model of a droplet generator is here presented together with a black-box identification procedure. Even if previous research works have shown the great potential of the droplet generator in terms of extracted power and have investigated the optimization of the device, a simple equivalent electrical circuit is not available, which is fundamental for predicting its behavior and for designing its electronic interface, devoted to maximizing the power extraction under varying source and load conditions. A detailed identification procedure for the model parameters is also presented, in order to overcome the issues due to the high voltage, low current, high bandwidth, and unknown time-waveform of the time-varying capacitances. It is also shown how the proposed model allows the designer to predict analytically and numerically the energy that can be extracted by the generator. Finally, experimental tests are presented to show that the proposed model and the outlined procedure are able to effectively predict with good accuracy the system behavior under different operating conditions.","['Electrodes', 'Capacitance', 'Generators', 'Integrated circuit modeling', 'Sensors', 'Contacts', 'Load modeling']","['Circuit analysis', 'circuit modeling', 'energy harvesting', 'parameter identification']"
"Large-area tactile sensors are used to image the pressure exerted by human body parts. More specifically, they can be used to measure plantar pressure on human stability tests. The center-of-pressure (CoP) trajectory is the primary outcome of such tests. Previous research has shown that the parameters obtained from the trajectory correlate with those obtained from a reference instrument, that is, a force platform (FP). However, there are still noticeable differences. In this work, a low-cost prototype of a pressure-sensitive mat (PSM) has been built and compared with an FP in stability tests. The sensitive material is Velostat, which is readily available. Such a mat could make objective stability tests more accessible. A model of two nonlinear effects, hysteresis and creep, has been considered to compensate for them. Given that it was rather difficult to characterize the large mat with a pneumatic device, a small-sized sensor array was first characterized in a controlled environment. Then the model was extended to the large mat using a suitable scaling factor. The experimental results show that compensating for the nonlinear effects led to a decrease in the differences between the two instruments, the FP and the mat, with an average improvement of 26% in the distance between the trajectories.","['Hysteresis', 'Creep', 'Sensors', 'Force', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Stability analysis', 'Sensor arrays']","['Center of pressure (CoP)', 'creep', 'force platform (FP)', 'hysteresis', 'resistive sensor array', 'stability test', 'tactile sensor']"
"Cameras and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors are commonly used together in autonomous vehicles to provide rich color and texture information and information on the location of objects, respectively. However, fusing image and point-cloud information remains a key challenge. In this article, we propose D-S augmentation as a 3-D object detection method based on point-cloud density and semantic augmentation. Our proposed approach first performs 2-D bounding box detection and instance segmentation on an image. Then, a LiDAR point cloud is projected onto an instance segmentation mask, and a fixed number of random points are generated. Finally, a globalN-nearest neighbor clustering is used to associate random and projected points to give depth to virtual points and complete point-cloud density augmentation (P-DA). Then, point-cloud semantic augmentation (P-SA) is performed, in which the instance segmentation mask of an object is used to associate it with the point cloud. The instance-segmented class labels and segmentation scores are assigned to the projected cloud, and the projection points added with 1-D features are inversely mapped to the point-cloud space to obtain a semantically augmented point cloud. We conducted extensive experiments on the nuScenes (Caesar et al., 2020) and KITTI (Geiger et al., 2012) datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Notably, D-S augmentation outperformed a LiDAR-only baseline detector by +7.9% in terms of mean average precision (mAP) and +5.1% in terms of nuScenes detection score (NDS) and outperformed the state-of-the-art multimodal fusion-based methods.

"Along with analysis and practical implementation, simulations play a key role in wireless networks and computational offloading research for several reasons. First, the simulations provide the ability to easily obtain the data for a complex system’s model evaluation. Second, simulated data provide a controlled environment for experimentation, allowing models and algorithms to be tested for robustness and identifying potential limitations before deploying them in real-world applications. Choosing the most appropriate tool for simulation might be challenging and depends on several factors, such as the main purpose, complexity of data, researcher skills, community support, and available budget. As of the time of the present analysis, several system-level open-source tools for modeling computational offloading also cover the systems’ communications side, such as CloudSim, CloudSim Plus, IoTSim-Edge, EdgeCloudSim, iFogSim2, PureEdgeSim, and YAFS. This work presents an evaluation of those based on the unique features and performance results of intensive workload- and delay-tolerant scenarios: XR with an extremely high data rate and workload; remote monitoring with a low data rate with moderate delays and workload requirements; and data streaming as a general human traffic with a relatively high bit rate but moderate workload. The work concludes that CloudSim provides a reliable environment for virtualization on the host resources, while YAFS shows minimal hardware usage, while IoTSim-Edge, PureEdgeSim, and EdgeCloudSim have fewer implemented features.","['Cloud computing', 'Computational modeling', 'Edge computing', 'Data models', 'Sensors', 'Servers', 'Wireless sensor networks']","['Cloud computing', 'edge computing', 'fog computing', 'modeling', 'simulation']"
"Conventional face direction estimation techniques detect the characteristic parts of the face, such as the nose, eyes, and mouth, and estimate the face orientation based on the movements of these features. However, these methods cannot accurately estimate the face direction when the characteristic parts of the face are hidden; for example, when the face is turned sideways or a mask is worn. Face detection using point cloud data has been investigated as a solution to these issues. Previous studies applied five classes of face direction estimation for the head using 3-D point cloud data. However, considering the practical use of driver assistance systems that verify the driver’s status, these five classes are not sufficient for accurately detecting the face direction, and a more precise horizontal wide-range angle detection approach is necessary. In this study, we acquired 3-D point cloud data ink(wherek>5) classes while accurately measuring the horizontal angle of the face during the acquisition of the training data using gyroscopic sensors. The training data captured by this depth-gyro sensor integration generates accurate depth data for each direction. As a result, a low number of point cloud data samples for each face direction were sufficient for generating the directional classification model. Therefore, this depth-gyro sensor integrated data capturing significantly reduces the amount of required training data. Furthermore, we applied a weight reduction process for the point cloud data to reduce the training time and performed deep learning to estimate the face direction. The proposed method achieved high performance in face direction detection using deep learning, even with a comparatively small dataset.","['Faces', 'Point cloud compression', 'Cameras', 'Gyroscopes', 'Deep learning', 'Training', 'Three-dimensional displays']","['Deep learning', 'depth sensor', 'gyro sensor', 'point cloud data', 'point cloud data resolution reduction']"
"This paper presents a relative pressure sensor fabricated by a standard industrial flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) technology. The passive wireless sensor consists of a variable sensing capacitor and a planar coil inductor. When the external pressure is applied to the sensing capacitor, it changes the air gap and shifts the LC resonance frequency which is detected by an antenna wirelessly. The sensing cavity of the variable capacitor is extended to the opening at the end of an embedded pressure channel in the FPCB strip to enable relative pressure measurement. Measurement results showed that the proposed sensor with such an open sensing cavity had much higher frequency sensitivity (up to 0.4 %/mmHg) compared with the sensor with a sealed cavity (< 0.01 %/mmHg in this work and ≤ 0.08 in literature). With the enhanced sensitivity, the measured pressure resolution could reach 0.2 mmHg. The potential application of the proposed sensor includes gauge pressure measurement with respect to local atmospheric pressure, such as intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, without complicated re-calibration procedures. The flat FPCB structure facilitates applications with limited space for sensor installation, such as in the subdural implantation procedures. Furthermore, the proposed technology enables future development of flexible microfluidic devices.","['Sensors', 'Capacitors', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Pressure sensors', 'Sensitivity', 'Capacitive sensors', 'Resonant frequency']","['Pressure sensor', 'relative pressure', 'gauge pressure', 'intracranial pressure (ICP)', 'wireless', 'LC resonance', 'flexible printed circuit board (FPCB)', 'flexible microfluidic devices']"
"Trip-related falls are a major concern, especially for older adults and individuals with gait impairments as they can lead to serious injuries, hospitalizations, and negatively impacting the quality of life. A low minimum toe clearance (MTC) can be a predictor of tripping risk, and thus, increasing the MTC is a possible way to reduce trip-related falls. In this article, a wearable system is proposed that can measure the MTC in real time using two time-of-flight (ToF) sensors on the shoe and provide auditory biofeedback using a piezo buzzer. Ten healthy female adults were recruited to walk in four conditions: baseline, biofeedback, short retention (same day), and long retention (next day) to design and validate our gait training tool. Average MTC values were compared pre-feedback, post-feedback, and post-retention, and our analysis revealed significant differences between the feedback and retention sessions for the training system. Therefore, the proposed system has the potential to be used as a wearable training system to minimize tripping risks in older adults and gait-impaired populations.","['Biological control systems', 'Sensors', 'Training', 'Legged locomotion', 'Visualization', 'Foot', 'Wearable sensors']","['Biofeedback', 'fall prevention', 'foot clearance', 'gait analysis', 'gait rehabilitation', 'gait training', 'time-of-flight (ToF) sensor', 'tripping', 'wearable']"
"The diagnostic accuracy (ACC) of otitis media with effusion (OME) depends on a clinician’s experience and evaluation tools. Various assessment technologies have been applied to support clinical diagnosis, such as digital otoscopy and tympanometry. However, several challenges and issues limit the capabilities and usability of these assessment technologies, including high costs and needing to rely on specialists’ interpretations. In this work, we designed and validated OME detection using a machine learning (ML) model and in-ear microphones. Two off-the-shelf microphones were placed in the bilateral ear canals to record the voice when participants pronounced five 3-s sustained vowel sounds. Various signal processing and ML techniques were applied to the recordings, and the magnitude spectrograms of the vowel sound recording from in-ear microphones can distinguish ears with OME from healthy ears according to the differences in high-frequency response. Our results using in-ear microphones and ML algorithms had an ACC of 80.65% in detecting OME, similar to that of typical OME detection approaches.

"Ceramic materials have many striking prospects as temperature sensors. Still, some inevitable shortcomings comprising toxicity, low biocompatibility, extensive response as well as recovery times, poor sensitivity, and hysteresis obstruct them from various progressive uses. Therefore, in this current exploration, a capacitive temperature sensor has been designed and developed using a lead-free ferroelectric ceramic Bi(Fe2/3Ta1/3)O3(BFT) by solid-state sintering technique. Compared with the conventional capacitive temperature sensor, the proposed BFT-based temperature sensor has a relatively high sensitivity of 280 fF/°C, a fast response time (4.27 s), and a recovery time (7.39 s). The developed sensor provides a reversible response with relatively low hysteresis and excellent repeatability over multiple cycles. The sensor’s response has been recorded for 30 days to confirm long-term stability. The excellent sensing properties of nontoxic BFT sensors make them a very promising electronic component for the development of high-performance capacitive temperature sensors for advanced electronic applications.","['Temperature sensors', 'Sensors', 'Capacitive sensors', 'Temperature measurement', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Capacitors', 'Temperature']","['Active low-pass filter (LPF)', 'capacitive temperature sensor', 'ferroelectric ceramic', 'relatively low hysteresis', 'sensitivity']"
"Functionalization plays a crucial role in the development of biosensors. In this study, bioreceptors were directly immobilized onto the surface of a sensing layer after physical activation, avoiding the need for longer and more complex functionalization systems. This direct immobilization was applied to an optical sensing platform based on lossy mode resonances (LMRs) generated by a thin film of titanium (IV) dioxide/poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (TiO2/PSS). To generate the LMR, a 200-μmbare optical fiber was coated with TiO2/PSS using the layer-by-layer self-assembly technique. The PSS of the sensing layer was then physically activated using either UV-ozone or plasma to immobilize antirabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) bioreceptors. This enabled specific and label-free detection of rabbit IgG concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 2 mg/mL. The results presented in this work include the real-time detection of rabbit IgG, a comparison between the two activation techniques (UV-ozone and plasma), and an analysis of the biosensor’s reusability over four consecutive cycles, which demonstrates the promising potential of the TiO2/PSS sensing layer for biosensing applications.","['Biosensors', 'Sensors', 'Surface treatment', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Optical fibers', 'Polymers', 'Plasmas']","['Biosensor', 'layer-by-layer (LbL)', 'lossy mode resonance (LMR)', 'optical fiber', 'titanium (IV) dioxide (TiO₂) thin film']"
"Modern monostatic radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) systems perform very well as long as the direction of human activities is either toward or away from the radar. The monostatic single-input–single-output (SISO) and monostatic multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems cannot detect motion of an object that moves perpendicularly to the radar’s boresight axis. Due to this physical layer limitation, today’s radar-based HAR systems fail to classify multidirectional human activities. In this article, we resolve this typical but critical physical layer problem of contemporary HAR systems. We propose a HAR system underlying a distributed MIMO radar configuration, where multiple antennas of a millimeter wave (mm-wave) MIMO radar system (Ancortek SDR-KIT 2400T2R4) are distributed in an indoor environment. In our proposed HAR system, we have two independent and identical monostatic radar subsystems that irradiate and capture the multidirectional human movement from two perspectives, which allows to compute two distinct time-variant (TV) radial velocity distributions. A feature extraction network extracts numerous features from the measured TV radial velocity distributions, which are then fused by a multiclass classifier to detect five types of human activities. The proposed multiperspective MIMO-radar-based HAR system achieves a classification accuracy of 98.52%, which surpasses the accuracy of SISO radar-based HAR system by more than 9%. Our approach resolves the physical layer limitations of modern HAR systems that are based on either monostatic SISO or monostatic MIMO radar systems.","['Human activity recognition', 'Radar', 'MIMO radar', 'Sensors', 'Feature extraction', 'MIMO communication', 'Deep learning']","['Deep learning', 'direction-independent human activity recognition (HAR)', 'fall detection', 'feature fusion', 'multistatic radar', 'multiview radar sensing', 'orientation-independent HAR']"
"Realization of “Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) on a chip” holds the potential of a disruptive technology for downhole chemical analysis within the oil and gas industry. One of the critical obstacles to downhole integration though has been the cooling requirements of conventional technologies. Here, we report the design and numerical analysis of an uncooled miniaturized Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) spectrometer compatible with downhole thermal environments, enabled by a broadband mid-infrared metasurface detector/source combination derived from a geometric inversion of a set of conformal mapping contours. The metasurface is numerically found to exhibit a near-zero index metamaterial (NZIM) behavior with absorption characterized by surface plasmon resonances confined to the ultrathin (λ/300) metasurface plane, making the absorption properties of the microbolometer design much less sensitive to the remaining support structure than in typical designs. This feature allows the metasurface to be integrated on a single VO2 substrate operated at elevated downhole temperatures that coincide with the metal–insulator transition region. Within this transition region, the VO2 material exhibits enhanced thermometric properties, enabling an uncooled microbolometer design with predicted maximum detectivityD∗=1.5×1010cmHz−−−√/Wand noise equivalent difference temperature (NEDT) of 1 mK at a modulation frequency of 500 Hz.

"Capacitive sensing at long ranges (10x the plate diameter) for long-term environmental monitoring can be limited by slow but significant measurement drifts from charge induction, which can exceed the small capacitance variations of interest, below 0.01%. This paper proposes a slope modulation differential capacitance measurement method for single-plate capacitive sensors operating in loading mode that effectively rejects noise from quasi-constant drift currents. It is based on periodical plate capacitance charge-discharge, like the period modulation frontends (astable multivibrators) that were used in past work, but it uses a constant oscillation period and compares the slopes of adjacent plate voltage ramps. Plate capacitance is calculated by averaging the slope magnitudes, which rejects the noise from quasi-constant drift currents. The sensitivity and noise rejection are compared with the period modulation techniques analytically, and the results are validated using simulations and experiments. They show that human body sensing range doubles and the noise floor is substantially lower compared to the state-of-the-art (period modulation).","['Sensors', 'Modulation', 'Capacitive sensors', 'Capacitance', 'Capacitance measurement', 'Oscillators', 'Current measurement']","['Capacitive sensor', 'differential measurement', 'drift rejection', 'noise reduction', 'environmental monitoring']"
"Intelligent fault detection and classification is a cornerstone of prognostic and health management of rotating machinery (RM) research. Correctly classifying and predicting RM faults not only increases productivity in industrial plants but also reduces maintenance costs. The datasets from real facilities needed to train fault classifiers often have few samples due to the expense of provoking faults in real scenarios to obtain data. This article proposes the use of the tabular prior-data fit network (TabPFN) model for the classification of faults in RM. TabPFN is a model which has been pretrained with a large amount of synthetic data with many causal relationships. This allows the model to perform Bayesian inference on the data used for training. The advantages of this model are its ability to be trained with limited data without generating overfitting problems and its high speed (if a graphics processing unit (GPU) is available). To compare its performance with traditional algorithms for tabular classification such as XGboost and random forest, three public datasets were used. Results show that TabPFN performs more accurately than algorithms with limited data, so it is suitable to be deployed in real scenarios when the amount of data available from the monitored RM is limited.","['Vibrations', 'Machinery', 'Training', 'Data models', 'Sensors', 'Feature extraction', 'Fault diagnosis']","['Fault classification', 'IIoT', 'predictive maintenance', 'rotating machinery (RM)', 'tabular prior-data fit network (TabPFN)']"

The derived model is validated with experimental characterization measurements in different operation pressures.

"To develop a measurement system for calibrating high-frequency dynamic pressure that is capable of acting as a primary dynamic pressure calibration standard, a new concept of the shock tube, called the diaphragmless shock tube, has recently been developed. In most such shock tubes the diaphragm is replaced with a commercially available, ISTA KB fast-opening valve. In this article a numerical model was built in OpenFOAM to investigate the effects of the opening mechanism of ISTA KB-40-100 fast-opening valve on the formation of the shock wave in a shock tube with an internal radius of 20 mm. Numerical simulations were performed for the driver-driven pressure ratio of 40 and the valve-opening speeds of 5 m/s, 10 m/s and 20 m/s, which were compared with the case of instantaneous valve opening, and the results predicted by the ideal shock tube theory. The observed variables were the mass flow through the valve, as well as the pressure, the temperature and the shock wave velocity in the formation region behind the valve. The results show that when the shock wave undergoes an initial acceleration, the shock front accelerates more at higher opening speeds of the valve. The results also show that the valve-opening mechanism generates a series of reflection waves that propagate into the driven section, giving the shock wave velocity an oscillatory character, which can affect the calibration and measurement capability of the shock tube as a primary high-frequency, time-varying, pressure calibration standard.","['Electric shock', 'Electron tubes', 'Shock waves', 'Valves', 'Sensors', 'Calibration', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization']","['Time-varying pressure', 'primary calibration method', 'diaphragmless shock tube', 'shock wave formation', 'numerical simulations', 'OpenFOAM']"
"Lactococcus lactis bacteriophage infections in milk prevent the proper lactic fermentation, leading to the production of unsaleable low-quality products and great economic losses in the dairy industry. In this work, we present an innovative biosensing approach for the cost-effective detection of L. lactis phages in milk-based samples through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The detection is based on the evident parametric shifts in the charge transfer resistance and in the impedance phase at 100 Hz caused by different bacteria proliferation due to phage activity. The EIS results are compared with optical absorbance measurements at 600 nm, in order to validate the proposed method. Preliminary experimental tests with filtered milk-based samples confirm the sensor capability to detect phages at different concentrations in milk-based solutions in less than 4 hours. In order to reach a higher sensitivity, we propose a new milk pre-treatment adding calcium chloride (CaCl 2 ) to the samples. The EIS results with CaCl 2 -treated milk evidence an enhanced phage activity, which leads to a much larger parametric shift.

The sensors are interrogated by a tunable laser operating at around1.55 μm, and their response to temperature and strain variations is characterized in a thermally controlled chamber and by bending tests using suspended calibrated loads and a laser scanning system. Experimental results are in good agreement with simulations, confirming that the embedding process effectively overcomes potential issues related to FBG spectral distortion, birefringence, and losses. In particular, the effects of the composite material nonhomogeneity and FBG birefringence are investigated to evaluate their impact on the monitoring capabilities. A bimaterial mechanical beam model is proposed to characterize the orthotropic laminates, pointing out better accuracy in estimating the applied load with respect to the classical homogeneous beam model. A comparative analysis, performed on different instrumented carbon composite samples and supported by theory, points out the repeatability of the FBG sensors’ embedding process and the effectiveness of the technology for real-time accurate strain measurement. Based on such measurements, damages and/or changes in local stiffness can be effectively detected, allowing for structural health monitoring (SHM) of composite structures for applications in specific industrial fields such as automotive and aerospace.","['Sensors', 'Fiber gratings', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Optical fibers', 'Carbon', 'Strain', 'Temperature sensors']","['Composite materials', 'fiber Bragg grating (FBG)', 'optical fiber sensors']"
"Internet of Things (IoT) is being increasingly used to enable continuous monitoring and sensing of physical things in the world. Energy efficiency is a critical aspect in its design and deployment, as IoT devices are usually battery-powered, and it is difficult, expensive, or even dangerous to replace the batteries in many real physical environments. In this article, an energy-efficient cloud-based IoT network model has been created by optimizing sensor selection, selecting the least number of hops, and leveraging fading sub-channel (sch) gain to reduce traffic power and cancel interference. Using the mixed integer linear programming (MILP), the optimization model and results are determined. The model assesses the outcomes of two possible scenarios: First, network optimization for energy efficiency based on the least number of hops, followed by a comparison with the second scenario. Second, energy-efficient network optimization by minimizing hops and selecting sch. The results indicate that the first scenario consumes more network traffic power in IoT devices, whereas the second scenario reduces network traffic power by an average of 27%.","['Internet of Things', 'Cloud computing', 'Sensors', 'Energy efficiency', 'Wireless sensor networks', 'Routing', 'Energy consumption']","['Cloud computing', 'energy efficiency', 'fading channel gain', 'interference cancellation', 'Internet of Things (IoT)', 'traffic power', 'transmission power']"
"This article introduces a new method for measuring finger joints’ motion based on the relative sliding motions of belts placed on the finger. Conventional mechanical methods used in wearable devices for measuring hand motions, such as a method using resistive sensors, require calibration for the difference in the fingers’ shapes of individuals. In contrast, the proposed method measures the metacarpophalangeal (MP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints flex motion of a finger except for the thumb without the above individual calibration using the difference in the sliding amount of belts on the finger surface. The simple equations show that the relative sliding amount of belts is proportional to joint angles with a factor of the belt thickness. Therefore, the method only need to know the belts’ thickness beforehand to calculate the joint angles from the relative belt positions but not the fingers’ shapes. Experiments with a prototype showed that the proposed method estimated the joint motion of the finger model driven by servomotors with an accuracy of less than 1° in three kinds of motions. The device was in an early stage of development as a data glove, but the accuracies were comparable to other wearable devices. The layered belts mechanism proposed here can provide an option to design a device to realize simplified hand motion measurement by eliminating cumbersome calibration processing for each execution. Furthermore, the simple measurement principle also has an advantage in robustness to noise, such as the drift seen in the devices using inertial measurement units (IMUs).","['Belts', 'Thumb', 'Wires', 'Sensors', 'Motion measurement', 'Thickness measurement', 'Shape']","['Belts', 'goniometers', 'motion estimation', 'motion measurement', 'wearable sensors', 'wire']"
"The location of a vessel’s center of flotation during operation at sea plays an important role in the vessel’s longitudinal stability. The ability to accurately estimate the location of the center of flotation improves safety monitoring as it indicates how changes in the distribution of weight affect the vessel. In this paper, we propose a novel method for estimating the longitudinal location of a vessel’s center of flotation in waves using acceleration readings taken simultaneously at different locations along the length of the vessel. Specifically, we recorded accelerations of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) in a towing tank. The ASV was operated in head and following regular waves, which were kept at a constant wave height of 0.12 m while the wave frequency was increased from 0.5 to 0.8 Hz at increments of 0.1 Hz. The results show that multiple acceleration measurements can be used to correctly determine the center of flotation of a vessel in waves. In this experiment, the estimated location of the center of flotation varied as expected based on the longitudinal asymmetry of the ASV and the difference between head and following waves, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the results were validated using the vessel’s recorded pitch motion.","['Cameras', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometers', 'Optical sensors', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Sensor systems']","['Qualisys', 'accelerometers', 'center of rotation', 'center of flotation', 'vessel safety', 'vessel stability']"
"In this article, we utilize the advantages of an event camera to tackle the visual place recognition (VPR) problem. The event camera’s high measurement rate, low latency, and high dynamic range make it well-suited to overcome the limitations of conventional vision sensors. However, to apply the existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithms such as NetVLAD, the asynchronous event stream should be converted to a synchronous image frame, which causes a loss in temporal information. To address this problem, this article proposes a method that employs the asynchronous characteristic of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to leverage the temporal nature of event streams. The event stream is converted to event images and tensors in our preprocessing module. The SNN-based reconstruction networks, which are converted from CNNs, reconstruct edge images from event tensors regardless of external environment changes. VPR is conducted by matching features of the database and those from NetVLAD, which we used as a feature extraction network in this study. To evaluate the performance of VPR by comparing the previous methods for DDD17 and the Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset, experimental results demonstrate that the matching accuracy of the proposed method is better than previous methods, especially for datasets with adverse weather conditions. We also verify that the performance and energy efficiency are improved with SNNs over CNNs.

"In the past few years, 3D imaging technology has received a lot of attention. Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras based on the indirect ToF principle calculate depth information by measuring the phase shift between the emitted periodic signal and the reflected signal. When the illumination from the modulated light source reaches the same pixel through multiple paths, multipath interference will occur. Acquisitions at multiple modulation frequencies are then required to separate the interfering paths. Parametric spectral estimation methods, such as Prony’s method and its robust variants, have shown success in resolving multiple paths from multi-frequency measurements. With the widespread usage of ToF cameras in various fields, the operating environment of the camera should be taken into account in order to obtain accurate 3D images. In this work, we aim to study the effect of dirt on 3D imaging systems quantitatively. To this end, ten sheets with different transmittances, between 50% and 100% are used. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time we provide standardized methods for evaluating the effect of dirt on protective covers in the depth estimation of “flash lidar”. The accuracy of depth measurements obtained by multi-frequency multipath recovery in the absence of dust is up to 99%. However, when the light transmittance of the protective cover is less than 90%, the measurement result is already unreliable. The experiments have shown that the depth measurements obtained using the multi-frequency estimation method are more accurate in the presence of dust than the single-frequency estimation method.","['Cameras', 'Sensors', 'Three-dimensional displays', 'Laser radar', 'Frequency measurement', 'Phase measurement', 'Interference']","['3D imaging', 'ToF camera', 'effect of dirt', 'parametric spectral estimation methods', 'metrological evaluation']"
"Temperature sensors have been widely developed to control the course of diseases, improve haptic feelings, and in multisensing systems to compensate for the output of other temperature-sensitive sensors. The use of additive manufacturing to produce resistive temperature detectors (RTDs) with reduced dimensions and bulkiness is attracting great interest. Among the relevant process parameters and design choices, the curing process must be considered. In this work, two different commercial metallic-based materials are cured at various temperatures to evaluate the differences in their microscopic and macroscopic behavior. The sensors were designed, developed, and evaluated for their temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) at different curing temperatures using a programmable climatic chamber. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) has been used to microscopically inspect the sensing structures with respect to the different curing temperatures. The results show insightful correlations between the macroscopic and microscopic behavior of the used inks as well as the performance of the sensors. In particular, increasing the curing temperature decreased the room temperature resistance in all the samples by up to 70% and increased the sensitivity by up to 95%. These findings will help propose better processes as well as design choices for the development of printed resistive temperature sensors.","['Temperature sensors', 'Ink', 'Sensors', 'Curing', 'Temperature measurement', 'Printing', 'Gold']","['Aerosol jet printing (AJP)', 'curing process evaluation', 'temperature sensors']"
"Tendon damage is a major risk of prestressed structures. Ground anchors are structural elements that introduce high levels of prestress, typically over 1000 kN. Tendon damage can threaten the stability of the structure they support. Particularly, the visual inspection of buried ground anchor tendons is impossible. Thus, assessing tendon damage is essential during its service life. In this study, an embedded tendon damage detection method based on the magnetostriction effect is developed. A parametric study was conducted to optimize the sensor parameters through numerical simulations based on the finite element method (FEM). Based on the results, the elasto-magnetic (EM) sensor was fabricated. Different damage degrees in tendons were measured at room temperature using the fabricated EM sensor. Subsequently, the induced electromotive force (EMF) and magnetic flux density were obtained. The finite element simulation results showed a quadratic relationship between the effective cross-sectional area reduction ratio (ARR) of the specimen due to damage and the peak of magnetic flux density. The experimental results were compared with the simulation results. This study introduces a promising nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method for detecting damage in the embedded tendon of ground anchors and demonstrates a design methodology for EM sensors suitable for the target object.","['Sensors', 'Tendons', 'Magnetic sensors', 'Magnetic flux', 'Steel', 'Force', 'Finite element analysis']","['Elasto-magnetic (EM) sensor', 'finite element (FE) simulation', 'ground anchor', 'magnetostriction effect', 'tendon damage']"

"Health personnel are often unavailable for supervised robot-aided neurorehabilitation in hospitals, and patients are usually challenged by transportation issues to get to the hospital. Thus, a discontinuity between therapy in the hospital and at home appears slowing down the upper extremity (UE) mobility recovery. The aim of this work was to develop a system, based on wearable devices and EMG armbands, able to assess the quality of the UE joint movements and intelligently guide the patients during home-based rehabilitation. This system fuses a classification model together with a dynamic time-warping (DTW) analysis. The classification model was trained with UE joint movements gathered from clinicians, obtaining more than 80% accuracy using only five joint angles. Then, the system was tested on two poststroke patients and a healthy subject. The results suggest that the proposed system can be: 1) a useful tool for clinicians to evaluate the rehabilitation therapy and 2) an intelligent system able to make decisions based on the quality of the activity executed at home.","['Trajectory', 'Sensors', 'Hospitals', 'Performance evaluation', 'Extremities', 'Neurorehabilitation', 'Robots', 'Magnetoelectronics']","['Magneto-inertial devices', 'self-managed rehabilitation', 'stroke assessment', 'upper extremity (UE)']"
"The fiber Bragg grating (FBG) temperature measurement technology has advantages, such as high accuracy, small size, anti-interference, and stable performance compared to traditional thermocouple technology in high-speed airflow total temperature testing. However, low recovery factors of FBG total temperature probes at low Mach numbers have been reported, which is very detrimental to improving the accuracy of the total temperature measurement. In this article, a 3-D structure model of FBG total temperature probe is established based on the characteristics of fiber as the temperature sensing element. The temperature distribution under different probe structural parameters, such as the inner diameter of the shield, the position, and length of FBG, is analyzed using conjugate heat transfer (CHT) multiphysics field model. Combined with coupled-mode theory, the spectral characteristics of different FBG parameters and their effects on the recovery factor are analyzed. The structure of FBG total temperature probe with high recovery factor is designed. The comparative experimental results of high-speed airflow show that the improved FBG total temperature probe has a recovery factor exceeding 0.92 from Mach number 0.3–0.8 and up to 0.99 at Mach number greater than 0.4, which has even exceeded the level of most traditional thermocouple total temperature probes.","['Temperature measurement', 'Probes', 'Fiber gratings', 'Sensors', 'Temperature distribution', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Thermocouples']","['Conjugate heat transfer (CHT)', 'coupled-mode theory', 'fiber Bragg grating (FBG)', 'recovery factor', 'total temperature']"
"This article describes a complete approach to filtering partial discharge (PD) pulses from interference in high voltage (HV) electrical equipment using supervised machine learning (ML) techniques. The PD signals are registered in ultra high frequency (UHF) radiation band with a multisensor acquisition system composed of four antennae. The proposed methodology focuses on the implementation ML algorithms and proposes a novel field approach to the onset detection of incoming signals. The goal was to achieve high accuracy of filtering with reasonably low compilation times of the ML classifier. That would allow to use the model on edge sensor devices. In this article, different models and training variants of the ML framework are tested.

"To enhance the accuracy of water-quality turbidity detection and address the challenges associated with drinking water safety, this study proposes a high-precision turbidity sensor detection approach. However, in practical water-quality monitoring, the design of the water-quality turbidity-monitoring system encounters difficulties arising from air bubbles in the water affecting beam refraction, excessive beam scattering angles impacting detection accuracy, and the need for precise water-quality turbidity measurements. To tackle these issues, this study presents a novel design comprising a pressurized air-removing device and an innovative mechanical structure, effectively eliminating difficult-to-remove air bubbles in the water channel. Furthermore, a lens with calibration is devised to effectively address the problem of excessive beam scattering angles. Based on the 90° scattering method, the designed sensor achieves an impressive detection limit of 0.001 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) and a concentration range of 0–100 NTU.

The method is validated through a comprehensive mathematical analysis, whose predictions are in agreement with a numerical Monte Carlo model of the problem.

"The estimation of the orientation of an object, and a human head in particular, can be defined by the Euler angles: the yaw, pitch and roll. The robust and drift-free estimation of those angles is usually achieved with the data from several sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers, processed with sensor fusion algorithms. However, wearable devices such as hearing instruments are rarely equipped with all those sensors, and might usually only have a single accelerometer embedded per device. While it is possible to retrieve a correct estimation of the roll and pitch using only a single accelerometer, estimating the yaw is a more challenging task as accelerations around the gravity vector cannot be detected by an accelerometer. In the context of binaural communication devices and spatial hearing, the yaw of the head is a key information that helps achieving dynamic binaural synthesis. This work proposes an algorithm that aims at estimating the yaw of a human head by using only two 3-axis accelerometers that are placed at each side of the head. The algorithm is evaluated with acceleration measurements of human subjects achieving a realistic task. The results suggest that the strategy used is promising as a good performance can be achieved for a majority of the measures as long as an individualized set of parameters can be selected. The results also suggest that the performance of the current implementation is sensitive to sensor displacement after calibration or a wrong estimation during initialization.","['Accelerometers', 'Sensors', 'Magnetic heads', 'Estimation', 'Tracking', 'Heuristic algorithms', 'Auditory system']","['Head-tracking', 'accelerometers', 'yaw', 'head movements']"
"The uncertainty introduced by the use of low-cost sensors (LCSs) in ad-hoc sensor networks is an ongoing concern that can be alleviated at the network level through a hybrid solution that relies on the use of reference nodes and reputation-based trust management. As reference nodes impose a significant expense, it is important to minimize their number while maximizing their impact on the reduction of uncertainty. This article presents a multidimensional analytical model developed through simulations that helps in predicting the extent of the decrease in uncertainty caused by an increase in the fraction of reference nodes in hybrid ad-hoc networks. The model shows that the marginal benefit of introducing reference nodes is much higher for networks with small fractions of such nodes, and quickly reaches near-saturation at about 5% of reference nodes, across all aspects of uncertainty.","['Sensors', 'Uncertainty', 'Ad hoc networks', 'Trust management', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Wireless sensor networks', 'Calibration']","['Hybrid ad-hoc sensor network', 'reference node', 'trust management', 'uncertainty']"
"This work presents an analysis of performance and multiple parameters of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) capacitive accelerometers in applications with large thermal variations and the effects of the soldering process on them. The proposed test consists of a thermal characterization phase performed between two mechanical calibrations. The test is performed on multiple units before and after the soldering process. Mechanical, thermal, and performance parameters are analyzed and compared among all tests. The ranges and relative variations of these characteristics, both during the soldering process and the tests, have been identified and characterized individually. Mechanical bias shows greater variability than other parameters in both the soldering process and thermal tests. On the contrary, the thermal characteristic parameters show great stability in all cases. The thermal drifts, which are the main source of error in environments with large thermal variations, are successfully compensated for using a model with only two characteristic parameters. According to the observed behaviors, negative thermal variations (toward cooler temperatures) might be more suitable for thermal calibration due to other effects, such as creep, taking place primarily at hotter temperatures. The creep effect at constant temperature is analyzed according to the Kelvin–Voigt model with promising results, and a possible link between thermal drift and creep effects is presented. Performance results are calculated in multiple compensation scenarios. Using the proposed compensation techniques, the average maximum error is reduced from over 70 to 7 mg and the uncertainty is also reduced to a third of the initial value.","['Sensors', 'Accelerometers', 'Micromechanical devices', 'Temperature sensors', 'Creep', 'Soldering', 'Calibration']","['Creep', 'microelectromechanical system (MEMS)', 'performance', 'soldering process', 'thermal drift', 'uncertainty']"

"Ambient particles from natural and anthropogenic sources are a major cause of premature deaths globally. While there are many instruments suitable for scientific measurements of aerosols, better methods for long-term monitoring purposes are still needed, especially low-maintenance, affordable solutions for ultrafine particles.

"Respiration is a necessary process for producing energy and maintaining normal bodily functioning in all living organisms. The respiratory system and breathing frequency change per the body’s needs in response to different physical activities, such as running, and to emotional states such as joy and fear. Therefore, this work presents a simulation-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensor module using thermistors to estimate the respiration rate (RR) of a human subject and to compare the temperature at the time of breathing. The circuit diagram of the explained sensor was designed and validated using simulations with Proteus software. The results are presented in the form of graphs, comparing resistance and voltage. Specifically, the resistance varies with the temperature near the thermistor, subsequently changing the voltage, which is converted into a digital value to calculate the RR and length of respiration. The main focus of the proposed work for developing this basic circuit is to observe the breathing pattern of a person. From the breathing pattern, many physical activities can be predicted, like he is in a consciousness stage or unconsciousness stage, because every physical activity makes an impact on the breathing pattern. The obtained information can be stored and communicated across the cloud, from which the automated respiratory tracking system can manage and monitor accidental situations.

"Temperature monitoring is an important tool for a broad variety of sensitive goods to maintain their quality and integrity during supply chain operations. To balance cost and benefit, many applications use sensors that only monitor a specific reference temperature limit. These sensor elements should be lightweight, low-cost and ready for wireless read out. In this work, an innovative sensor concept is presented, that can meet these requirements. It irreversibly changes its electrical resistance from low impedance to high-impedance if a certain temperature value is violated. The sensor element uses wax as a temperature-dependent element. If its melting temperature is exceeded, the liquid wax starts to flow into a textile reservoir. The descending liquid level of the outflowing wax disrupts an inkjet-printed nanoparticle layer that electrically connects the sensor’s input and output contact. A fluidic resistance between wax and textile reservoir regulates the speed of wax flow. Thus, it is possible to set a time delay for triggering the sensor after the threshold temperature is reached. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed sensor concept experimentally. Furthermore, the sensor element is connected to a custom-made RFID-tag, which allows wireless read out of the sensor state.

"An all-solid-state pH sensing system utilizing a stainless steel vessel (SUS304) and a pH-insensitive diamond solution-gate field-effect transistor (SGFET) is presented here to explain the interaction between stainless steel vessel and field-effect transistor (FET) pH sensors for the first time. A pH-sensitive ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) was first used to show the change of the sensing behavior from 47.78 to −4.73 mV/pH when using an Ag/AgCl electrode and stainless steel vessel as the gate. This intriguing sensing behavior was investigated by developing large- and small-signal equivalent circuit models in a transistor circuit for both the Ag/AgCl and the stainless steel vessel gate. The result shows that the targeted ion changeΔQhcorresponding to the pH sensitivity has been offset, which explains the phenomenon observed when using the pH-sensitive ISFET with the stainless steel vessel. We then hypothesize that combining a pH-insensitive device with the stainless steel vessel gate should show a pH sensitivity close to the Nernst response. To validate this, a pH-insensitive diamond SGFET was then fabricated and combined with the stainless steel vessel for pH measurements. The system demonstrates a high pH sensitivity at −54.18 mV/pH across a wide range of pH solutions (pH 2–12) and remains stable in elevated temperatures when measured with a potentiostat setup at 80 °C. The results also suggest that this all-solid-state sensing system has great potential to be used in the food and beverage industry where stainless steel is widely employed due to its excellent corrosion resistance, low cost, and high sensing capabilities.","['Sensors', 'Steel', 'Diamonds', 'Electrodes', 'Logic gates', 'Sensitivity', 'Equivalent circuits']","['All-solid-state pH sensor', 'field-effect transistors (FETs)', 'pH sensitivity', 'polycrystalline diamond', 'stainless steel']"
"Here, we present a new type of potassium sensor which possesses a combination of potassium sensing and anti-biofouling properties.

This limitation increases the risk of potential collisions. Additionally, there are multiple polished materials that generate noise due to reflection. In order to have a robust occupancy grid map representation, these problems must be addressed. This paper proposes the usage of a 3D laser scan sensor to generate a 2D occupancy grid map that incorporates the complete geometry of objects and effectively filters out noise from reflective materials like glass. The main novelty of the method is that it takes advantage of all the available 3D data to avoid any information loss about objects’ shapes. Additionally, a new approach for filtering reflection noise based on the analysis of indoor structural elements is proposed. Both approaches are merged for the creation of a robust indoor representation that allows to safely navigate the environment. Finally, a recursive Bayesian filter is applied for merging data, so noise due to dynamic elements that appeared during data collection is also filtered. Experimental evaluations in indoor environments with diverse objects and reflective surfaces, including dynamic elements like people, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","['Sensors', 'Three-dimensional displays', 'Robots', 'Robot sensing systems', 'Measurement by laser beam', 'Robot kinematics', 'Shape']","['Robust Map Building', 'Occupancy Grid Map', '3D Laser Scan', 'Reflection']"
An optical fiber sensor system for distributed optical absorption spectroscopy based on light diffusing optical fiber is proposed and evaluated. The sensor is composed by two light-diffusing glass fibers radiatively coupled. The light from a pulsed laser diode (PLD) propagates along the first fiber and is locally diffused out into the medium between the fibers. The light transmitted by the medium is partially collected by the second fiber and detected at the end of the fiber by an optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) detection scheme. The system permits distributed measurements of the optical absorption properties of the sample medium between the fibers. The experimental results confirm the possibility of distributed measurements with a spatial resolution of about 17 cm over 4 m of measurement range. Distributed chemical sensing has also been evaluated by measuring the absorption of water solutions containing copper ions. A limit of detection (LOD) of 710 ppm has been achieved.,"['Optical fiber sensors', 'Optical fibers', 'Sensors', 'Optical variables measurement', 'Optical pulses', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Robot sensing systems']","['Distributed sensors', 'fiber-optic sensors', 'light diffusing fiber (LDF)', 'optical spectroscopy']"
"This work describes a new platform for sensing mass or rheological properties of gases with unprecedented responsivity and limits of detection. The system consists of a microcantilever working in a phase-locked loop (PLL) with an imposed phase between its excitation and deflection signals. The optically detected cantilever deflection is demodulated against digitally synthetized reference signals, and the quadrature component (Q-signal) is used as the error parameter in a PI controller, which continuously tracks the oscillation frequency. The direct digital synthesis of the reference and actuation signals allows low-noise and fast-transient responses of the sensor for real-time detection of minute changes of any environmental parameter. A general analytical model is derived, used to understand the dynamical response of the platform, and validated against experiments using different gases and pressures. In particular, the responsivity of the sensor to density variations of the fluids and the stability of its frequency response are studied and measured. It is shown that the responsivity and the achieved limits of detection depend on the chosen phase imposed in the loop. A limit of detection for density variations of3.5×10−4kg/m3in air is measured, in agreement with the theoretical predictions, and one to two orders of magnitude lower than any reported value achieved with the same type of physical uncoated resonant sensors.","['Sensors', 'Oscillators', 'Gases', 'Resonant frequency', 'Fluids', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Viscosity']","['Density sensing', 'limit of detection', 'microcantilever', 'responsivity']"
"A hybrid method is proposed for removing artifacts from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This relies on the integration of artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) with multivariate empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The method can be applied when few EEG sensors are available, a condition in which existing techniques are not effective, and it was tested with two public datasets: 1) semisynthetic data and 2) experimental data with artifacts. One to four EEG sensors were taken into account, and the proposal was compared to both ASR and multivariate EMD (MEMD) alone. The proposed method efficiently removed muscular, ocular, or eye-blink artifacts on both semisynthetic and experimental data. Unexpectedly, the ASR alone also showed compatible performance on semisynthetic data. However, ASR did not work properly when experimental data were considered. Finally, MEMD was found less effective than both ASR and MEMD-ASR.","['Sensors', 'Electroencephalography', 'Calibration', 'Cleaning', 'Covariance matrices', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Principal component analysis']","['Artifact removal', 'electroencephalography', 'empirical mode decomposition (EMD)', 'few sensors', 'low cost']"
"In this work, a low-temperature fabrication process of thin-film encapsulation (TFE) with silicon nitride/chromium cap is proposed for large-size (750×300μm) packaging of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). A finite element method (FEM) model was developed to evaluate the shape of TFE as a function of the residual stress and the thickness of the sealing layer, providing useful guidelines for the fabrication process. The low temperature of 200 °C, which was used in the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of the silicon nitride capping layer, allowed an organic sacrificial material to be employed for the definition of the encapsulation area. Silicon nitride/chromium (1μm/20 nm) bilayer was demonstrated to be successful to overcome the technological limitations that affect the creation of cap holes with size of∼2μmon high-topography substrates, as in the case of MEMS. Plasma focused ion beam (PFIB) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques were used in combination to gain deeper insight into the sealing process of cap holes. Specifically, a PFIB–SEM serial Section procedure was developed, resulting to be a powerful tool to directly observe the sealing profile above cap holes. Hence, the presented results greatly contribute to overcome the main technological/reliability issues of TFE, paving the way for the widespread application of the proposed encapsulation methodology to the most used MEMS devices, such as radio frequency (RF) switches, transducers, actuators, sensors, and resonators.","['Micromechanical devices', 'Residual stresses', 'Fabrication', 'Encapsulation', 'Sensors', 'Silicon nitride', 'Bending']","['Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)', 'residual stress', 'silicon nitride', 'thin-film encapsulation (TFE)']"
"Small leaks, many of which often go undetected using conventional gauges, remain an urgent problem for an aging pipeline infrastructure. This paper proposes a method that allows for an automated and robust leak detection and localization system by fusing Distributed Acoustic Sensor (DAS) and Distributed Temperature Sensor (DTS) data for machine learning. Distributed fiber-optic sensing creates an advantage over conventional gauges by providing real-time continuous measurements along the entire length of the fiber-instrumented pipeline at a high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity that can detect small leaks, as well as the leak location. High sensitivity, however, can create noisy data. Thus, machine learning is applied for a robust method of distinguishing non-leak data from leak signatures for accurate leak detection and localization. The workflow is demonstrated on an experimental pipeline setup exposed to environmental noise. The results illustrate reliable detection of small leaks between 0.04 L/s to 0.30 L/s with F1 scores over 0.9, on a range of DAS frequency bands combined with DTS data. The fusion of two different types of distributed fiber-optic sensors not only increases the likelihood of small leaks being detected but decreases the number of false alarms by filtering noise that only appears in one sensor domain. Furthermore, the machine learning approach utilizes segmentation, allowing for precise localization and quick investigation, as well as AI explainability of the sensor data deemed a leak signature.","['Sensors', 'Pipelines', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Leak detection', 'Machine learning', 'Location awareness', 'Temperature sensors']","['Distributed fiber-optic sensing', 'image segmentation', 'leak detection', 'machine learning', 'sensor fusion']"
"Diabetes is one such chronic disease that, if undetected, can result in several adverse symptoms or diseases. It requires continuous and active monitoring, for example, by using various smartphone sensors, wearable/smart watches, etc. These devices are minimally invasive in nature and can also track various physiological signals, which are important for the prediction of diabetes. Machine-learning algorithms and artificial intelligence are some of the most important tools used for the prediction/detection of diabetes using different types of physiological signals. In this study, we have focused on using multiple sensors such as glucose, electrocardiogram (ECG), accelerometer (ACC), and breathing sensors for classifying patients with diabetes disease. We analyzed whether a single sensor or multiple sensors can predict diabetes well. We identified various time-domain and interval-based features that are used for predicting diabetes and also the optimal window size for the feature calculation. We found that a multisensor combination using glucose, ECG, and ACC sensors gives the highest prediction accuracy of 98.2% with the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. Moreover, multisensor prediction shows nearly 4%–5% increase in the diabetes prediction rates as compared to single sensors. We observed that breathing-sensor-related data have very little influence on the prediction of diabetes. We also used the score-fit-times curve as one of the metrics for the evaluation of models. From the performance curves, we observed that three-sensor combinations using glucose, ECG, and ACC converge faster as compared to a four-sensor combination while achieving with same accuracy.","['Sensors', 'Diabetes', 'Electrocardiography', 'Glucose', 'Accelerometers', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Monitoring']","['Accelerometer (ACC) sensor', 'breathing sensor', 'complexity evaluation', 'diabetes', 'electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor', 'ensemble algorithm', 'extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)', 'feature fusion', 'glucose sensors']"
"Capacitive sensors are widely used in robotics for their compactness, high resolution, high sensitivity, and large dynamic range. In this article, we present a design solution for the manufacturing of capacitive tactile sensors with enhanced dynamic range and sensitivity. Herein, we adopted the approach of exploiting the vertical direction of the sensors by creating stacks of capacitors. The validation of the proposed model is conducted by means of finite element simulations and the effectiveness of stacked capacitors in suboptimal configurations has been experimentally tested by using inkjet printing and spin coating-based fabrication techniques. Results show that these sensors exhibit an enhanced dynamic range and sensitivity with respect to common single capacitors, for a given sensors area budget. Sensitivity increases of 235% passing from one-stack to two-stack capacitors (from 5.75 to 19.3 fF/kPa) and a growth of 23% from two-stack to three-stack capacitors (from 19.3 to 23.7 fF/kPa). These results suggest that the proposed methodology could be adopted for designing tactile sensors with higher spatial resolution and higher transduction sensitivity and dynamic range, in the perspective of an integration over large areas.","['Sensors', 'Capacitive sensors', 'Sensitivity', 'Capacitance', 'Capacitors', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Mathematical models']","['Capacitive tactile sensing', 'dynamic range', 'inkjet printing', 'robotics', 'sensitivity', 'stack']"
"Recently, flexural ultrasonic transducers for ultrasound measurement towards 200 bar were demonstrated, overcoming the major limitation of commercial variants associated with pressure imbalances due to their rear seals. One solution is through venting approaches, and another is introducing an incompressible fluid to the transducer’s interior, thus creating a pressure balance across the vibrating plate. However, this approach has not been validated for repeated pressurization cycles consistent with practical industrial applications. Here, the structural resilience and dynamic responses of oil filled flexural ultrasonic transducers towards 200 bar are investigated through finite element and experimental methods, including electrical impedance and pitch-catch measurements. Sequential pressurization and depressurization cycles are applied, where the relationship between dynamic response and pressure level is monitored, and the transducer is assessed for its potential longevity in performance. The results demonstrate that via an incompressible fluid in the sensor cavity, stable and reliable ultrasound measurements, across frequency, electrical impedance, and amplitude, are possible across multiple pressurization and depressurization cycles towards 200 bar, where associated pulse envelopes can be used to directly correlate with the environmental pressure level.",[],[]

"A microfluidic mixer is integrated with a dual-band microwave resonator to allow in situ monitoring of mixing two liquids. The resonator is a complementary double split-ring resonator, which is etched in the ground plane of a microstrip transmission line. The output channel of the mixer is conducted below the ground plane in the near field of the resonator. Electromagnetic and fluid dynamic simulations have been performed to design optimal channel configurations for this Section to increase the sensitivity, minimize the volume of the required liquid sample, and eliminate unwanted microfluidic mixing. The frequency variation of the first two resonances is monitored by measuring the transmission parameter of the microstrip line. The performance of the device is demonstrated by mixing saline solutions of different concentrations and the transmission spectra of different chemicals are also presented.

"This paper addresses indoor environment mapping by employing the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. The mmWave-based SAR can provide a high-resolution map for example of an emergency scenario like a burning room. The high-resolution map drives a new era of SAR applications such as object detection, classification, characterization, and precise localization. A major requirement at high frequencies is the precise knowledge of SAR trajectory, where radar sensors are mounted on a mobile platform such as a drone or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). State-of-the-art localization methods such as GPS-aided inertial measurement units are not valid due to limited coverage and accuracy. One of the primary solutions could be the SAR assisted with an indoor localization system, which is exploited in the work. The presented indoor localization system comprises two types of passive chipless frequency-coded tags, based on dielectric resonators and frequency-selective surfaces. In this work, firstly, the proposed method of integrating SAR and localization systems is evaluated in a single-tag environment. Further, a version of a room equipped with a multi-tag system is considered for real-time applications, and a successful demonstration of indoor environment mapping for the frequency spectrum of 75-110 GHz is presented.","['Location awareness', 'Millimeter wave communication', 'Synthetic aperture radar', 'Radar imaging', 'Imaging', 'Simultaneous localization and mapping', 'Radar']","['indoor imaging', 'high-resolution SAR', 'mmWave identification', 'mmWave indoor mapping', 'passive tag localization', 'radar imaging']"
"This article introduces the design and fabrication of a microwave contactless sensor used to detect the presence of millimetric inclusions in a biological medium for biomedical applications. The hardware system comprises a self-resonant planar spiral resonator (SR) (sensing element) inductively coupled to an external concentric single-loop probe (reading probe), working at 648 MHz. The microwave sensor configuration relies on theQ-factor maximization of the spiral coil, that is, the sensing element, through an optimization process, to obtain a stronger sensitivity and, thus, a millimeter resolution for the inclusions’ detection. The detection is achieved by recording both the amplitude variation and the frequency shift of the input impedance of the reading probe. To validate the proposed solution, full-wave simulations have been performed to design and preliminary evaluate the radiating system performance in detecting millimetric biological inclusions. As an applicative example, we focus on air bubbles detection in hemodialysis procedures; in particular, we carried out the experimental verification by employing an agar phantom to replicate the dielectric characteristics of the blood tissue and polylactic acid (PLA) samples of various sizes to represent the air inclusions. We proved that the theoretical assumptions were in excellent agreement with both the numerical and experimental results, encouraging further analysis of the potential use of such sensors in biomedical applications. Indeed, the radiating device can be very helpful for all operations where it is necessary to detect the presence of undesired and dangerous contaminants in a contactless way, making the procedure safer for patients.","['Sensors', 'Biology', 'Probes', 'Object detection', 'Biosensors', 'Spirals', 'Acoustics']","['Hemodialysis', 'microwaves', 'Q-factor', 'sensors', 'target detection']"
"Gyroscopes are inertial sensors whose field of application is rapidly expanding. The growing interest in autonomous systems, CubeSats as well as their constellations, and unmanned vehicles is stimulating a strong interest in miniaturized gyroscopes for integration in inertial units with a volume smaller than100cm3. Some of these applications require gyroscopes that are highly immune to disturbances, especially vibrations, mechanical shocks, and radiation. In these application contexts, the use of microelectromechanical gyroscopes is often avoided in favor of sensors without moving parts, such as optical gyroscopes based on the Sagnac effect. The technology of interferometric optical gyroscopes is currently considered to be potentially capable of enabling the development of highly innovative angular velocity sensors, which are simultaneously inertial grade and miniaturized. This article critically examines the scientific and research and development activity aimed at miniaturization of interferometric optical gyroscopes, focusing on recent results, perspectives, and physical limitations. Interferometric optical gyroscopes with dimensions similar to those of microelectromechanical gyroscopes and better performance than the latter in terms of immunity to disturbances have not yet been demonstrated, but this article shows how this goal could be realistically achieved in the medium term through the use of integrated microphotonics.

"Low-cost sensors (LCSs) show a huge potential towards enabling the pervasive and continuous monitoring of crucial environmental parameters, supporting environment preservation and informing citizens’ well-being through ubiquitous air quality data. The main drawback of LCSs is that their data is usually biased, even if LCSs are calibrated by their manufacturer at production time. More accurate in-field calibration methods based on machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NNs) are being considered in some recent studies. They typically imply LCSs co-location with reference measurement stations certified by environmental agencies. Due to seasonality effects, however, the correlation between LCSs and their reference may rapidly degrade once the LCSs are moved from the calibration site, making even really accurate calibrations useless. In this work, we specifically target this problem by optimizing the training settings of the most popular ML and NN calibration models for LCSs when a sequential split schema is adopted to separate training- and test-set. Then, we assess the degradation of the calibration over time based on the R2 score, when the splitting of the dataset between training- and test-set is different from the classical 80% - 20% ratio. This method is applied to real data gathered from an O 3 sensor deployed in co-location with a certified reference station for a period of 6 months. Eventually, we show that, in the case of Long-Short Term Memory NNs, using 20% of the dataset for the training is a trade-off condition that minimizes the calibration effort and still yields a robust and long-lasting calibration.","['Sensors', 'Calibration', 'Training', 'Monitoring', 'Wireless sensor networks', 'Air quality', 'Time series analysis']","['Calibration method', 'harmful pollutants', 'low-cost sensors', 'machine learning', 'neural networks', 'Prophet forecasting', 'sequential split training', 'time series']"
"We present a method for the design of heater electrodes on substrates with high thermal conductivity such as sheet metal. The substrate is covered with a thin polymer insulation layer on both faces, which are, in turn, carrying screen printed, electrically conductive heater electrodes and another protective polymer overlayer. The temperature inside a predetermined optimization area is required to be as uniform as possible, which is desirable for various high-precision heating applications. We alternatively also aim to design a heater structure to create non-uniform temperature distributions such as a temperature dip, a peak or a gradient. These temperature distributions are required for droplet operations like splitting, merging, and moving droplets, subsequently realizing a newly proposed “lab on metal” approach in microfluidics. For this purpose, an optimization algorithm yields the required distances between linear heater electrodes. The resulting electrode distribution was numerically obtained for different optimization areas.

"Hyphenated analytical techniques enable the simultaneous measurement of relevant processing and materials parameters under identical environmental conditions. In the current study, a power-compensated differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was custom-modified to enable the integration of an optical fibre sensor to monitor in situ the progression of the cross-linking reactions by inferring the evolution of the refractive index. A cleaved optical fibre was used and it served as a Fresnel reflection sensor (FRS). The DSC was calibrated with and without the integrated FRS and it was demonstrated that it did not influence the performance of the DSC. The FRS was calibrated using reference refractive index oils within the DSC. An epoxy/amine resin system was cross-linked at70oCand the enthalpy of cross-linking and the evolution of the refractive index were monitored simultaneously using the DSC and FRS respectively. After the cross-linking was completed, the DSC was programmed to perform a ramped heating schedule from ambient temperature to150oC.

"Eddy current tomography (ECT) is a very well established electromagnetic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method for the imaging of conducting and possibly magnetic materials. It relies on the capability of low-frequency electromagnetic fields to penetrate conducting materials. The underlying physical principle is electromagnetic induction, where the displacement current in Maxwell equations is neglected (magnetoquasistatic (MQS) limit). From a general perspective, ECT is an inverse problem, which poses serious challenges due to its inherent nonlinearity. This contribution introduces a transfer function for time-domain ECT, and proves that it satisfies the monotonicity principle (MP). This is relevant because MPs have been recognized as a key concept in developing real-time imaging methods and algorithms. The transfer function introduced in this contribution represents the input-output relationship for the forced response when the system is driven by an exponentially decaying current. Specifically, it corresponds to the Laplace transform of the system, evaluated on the real negative semiaxes. Finally, we describe the imaging method based on the MP, and we provide extensive 3-D numerical results in a realistic scenario, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.","['Tomography', 'Imaging', 'Coils', 'Eddy currents', 'Transfer functions', 'Shape', 'Mathematical models']","['Eddy current tomography (ECT)', 'imaging', 'inverse problems', 'monotonicity principles (MPs)']"
"Natural and artificial superhydrophobic surfaces are a rapidly growing topic in both academia and industry due to their unique properties and applications. Numerous techniques have been developed to characterize the wetting properties of such surfaces, such as the optical contact angle goniometer, force-based methods, and microscopic techniques for visualizing the wetting interface. However, a method that combines nN resolution force measurement with direct observation of the wetting interface on opaque superhydrophobic surfaces is missing. Here, we report a high-sensitivity multimodal force-sensing transparent droplet probe for the characterization of superhydrophobic surfaces that allows simultaneous visualization of the wetting interface and measurement of interaction forces. The probe is composed of a transparent glass cantilever with a droplet probe attached to its end. During the interaction with the sample, the wetting interface is directly imaged through the probe, illuminated with coaxial lighting. The interaction force is simultaneously measured as the deflection of the cantilever-shaped probe. By combining top view, side view, and high-resolution force sensing, the probe can reveal force contributions from both surface tension and Laplace pressure and measure super-repellent surfaces with contact angles near 180° with a low experimental uncertainty of 0.5°.","['Probes', 'Surface topography', 'Surface roughness', 'Rough surfaces', 'Force measurement', 'Cameras', 'Optical variables measurement']","['Droplet', 'force measurement', 'multimodal sensor', 'superhydrophobic', 'wetting characterization', 'wetting interface']"
"This paper proposes a multipoint processing method (MCP) for FMCW LiDAR. The proposed method reduces the number of fast Fourier transform (FFT) calculation compared to the traditional FMCW LiDAR method. This leads to a reduced power consumption. To end this, the proposed method accumulates the multiple beat frequencies in the time domain before the FMCW LiDAR extracts the measured distances from the beat frequencies using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). In order to distinguish the distances that are extracted from the FFT operation, a pulse-width modulation (PWM) counter and an analog comparator were applied. A hysteresis analog comparator was used to increase the immunity from the external noise. When the measured distances are too close to be indistinguishable by the FFT, it may fail to distinguish the measurement order. In order to respond to this situation, the proposed method includes a point-calibration algorithm. The root mean square error (RMSE) and hardware resource usage are utilized in order to assess the performance of the proposed method.

"Axial piston pumps have been extensively applied in hydraulic systems, and their reliability takes on critical significance in the stable operation of the entire hydraulic system. How to extract fault feature parameters and identify faults in axial piston pumps turns out to be vital in ensuring the safety and reliability of the hydraulic system. In this study, a fault diagnosis method of multisensor information fusion for axial piston pumps is proposed based on improved wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and kernelized support tensor train machine (KSTTM). Four-layer WPD is used to obtain different frequency band features of vibration, sound, and pressure signals. The intraclass and interclass distances are then introduced for quantitative evaluation of the decomposition results, which enables the selection of the optimal wavelet basis function. Subsequently, a new structured feature representation model, the structure tensor space model, is proposed to fuse the features of multiple signals. A multiclass classifier model of KSTTM optimized by multiobjective salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is developed to identify the fault states of the pumps. The experimental results show that multisensor information fusion can obtain better results compared with a single sensor.

"This work presents a novel sensor setup for the general detection of liquid-liquid interfaces in different mixes of liquids as part of a liquid-liquid extraction device. The sensor setup is applied to a laboratory scale separatory funnel. It uses a near infrared sensor array which receives light going through the liquids inside the funnel, which are illuminated by a light source located on the other side and below the funnel. Light refracts inside the funnel and the liquids and reflects on the interface creating changing patterns in the light intensity measured by the sensor, providing a way of locating the liquid-liquid interface. Liquid mixes with different optical features, from transparent to opaque, emulsion and clean, are used to test whether different types of interfaces produce a distinguishable response on the sensor, allowing to detect interfaces in different situations that can occur as part of an Artificial Intelligence orchestrated battery chemical synthesis process. Emulsion interfaces create a discernible change in the sensor input by lowering the light intensity registered when crossing in front of the sensor making them easier to locate than with other optical techniques. The setup opens the possibility of detecting a liquid-liquid interface as it is forming and can be miniaturized to be attached to laboratory funnels as a manual aid or used with other transparent vessels in automatic solutions like liquid handling robots or pipetting robots.","['Sensors', 'Liquids', 'Optical sensors', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Chemical sensors', 'Solvents', 'Compounds']","['NIR sensor', 'liquid-liquid extraction', 'liquid-liquid interface', 'emulsion', 'general LLE']"

"[[gabstract]][] Predictive maintenance of equipment requires a set of data collected through sensors, from which models will learn behaviors that will allow the automatic detection or prediction of these behaviors. The objective is to anticipate unexpected situations such as sudden equipment stoppages. Industries are noisy environments due to production lines that involve a series of components. As a result, the data will always be obstructed by noise. Noise-robust predictive maintenance models, which include ensemble and deep learning models with and without data fusion, are proposed to enhance the monitoring of industrial equipment. The work reported in this article is based on two components, a milling tool, and a motor, with sound, vibration, and ultrasound data collected in real experiments. Four main tasks were performed, namely the construction of the datasets, the training of the monitoring models without adding artificial noise to the data, the evaluation of the robustness of the previously trained models by injecting several levels of noise into the test data, and the optimization of the models by a proposed noisy training approach. The results show that the models maintain their performances at over 95% accuracy despite adding noise in the test phase. These performances decrease by only 2% at a considerable noise level of 15-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The noisy training method proved to be an optimal solution for improving the noise robustness and accuracy of convolutional deep learning models, whose performance regression of 2% went from a noise level of 28 to 15 dB like the other models.","['Noise measurement', 'Training', 'Data models', 'Predictive models', 'Deep learning', 'Noise robustness', 'Monitoring']","['Accelerometer', 'deep learning', 'ensemble learning', 'machine learning (ML)', 'microphone', 'noise robustness', 'noisy training', 'predictive maintenance', 'ultrasound', 'white Gaussian noise']"
"Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar sensors are emerging as valid alternatives to cameras for the pervasive contactless monitoring of people in indoor spaces. However, commercial mmWave radars feature a limited range (up to 6–8 m) and are subject to occlusion, which may constitute a significant drawback in large, crowded rooms characterized by a challenging multipath environment. Thus, covering large indoor spaces requires multiple radars with known relative position and orientation and algorithms to combine their outputs. In this work, we present ORACLE, an autonomous system that ( i ) integrates automatic relative position and orientation estimation from multiple radar devices by exploiting the trajectories of people moving freely in the radars’ common fields of view, and ( ii ) fuses the tracking information from multiple radars to obtain a unified tracking among all sensors. Our implementation and experimental evaluation of ORACLE results in median errors of 0.12 m and 0.03° for radars location and orientation estimates, respectively. Fused tracking improves the mean target tracking accuracy by 27%, and the mean tracking error is 23 cm in the most challenging case of 3 moving targets. Finally, ORACLE does not show significant performance reduction when the fusion rate is reduced to up to 1/5 of the frame rate of the single radar sensors, thus being amenable to a lightweight implementation on a resource-constrained fusion center.","['Radar', 'Radar tracking', 'Sensors', 'Millimeter wave communication', 'Target tracking', 'Sensor fusion', 'Spaceborne radar']","['Indoor sensing', 'mmWave radar network', 'self calibration', 'radar fusion', 'sensor fusion', 'people tracking']"
"The rapid advancement of biosensor technology has revolutionized healthcare, offering improved sensitivity, specificity, and portability. We have developed an optical cavity-based biosensor (OCB) as a promising solution due to its label-free detection, high sensitivity, real-time monitoring, multiplexing capability, and versatility. The OCB consists of an optical cavity structure (OCS), optical components, and a low-cost camera. The OCS is created by two partially reflective surfaces separated by a small gap, where the interaction between target analytes and immobilized receptors leads to a shift in the resonance transmission spectrum, caused by minute changes in the local refractive index (RI). In our previous work, we successfully detected these small changes with a simple OCS and cost-effective components using a differential detection method. Building upon these achievements, this study focuses on optimizing the OCS, improving the camera settings, and enhancing the differential detection approach. By increasing the reflectance of the surfaces and optimizing the optical cavity widths correspondingly, we achieved an improved limit of detection (LOD). We also investigated how the charge-coupled device (CCD) camera shutter time affects the LOD. Additionally, we introduced a new differential equation to further enhance the sensitivity of our system. Through these advancements, we could improve the LOD of the OCB by 7.2 times, specifically for an OCS with a cavity thickness of9.881 μmand a silver thickness of 46.87 nm. These findings not only contribute to the ongoing effort of optimizing the OCB, but also pave the way for the development of advanced point-of-care biosensors with enhanced detection capabilities.","['Substrates', 'Silver', 'Biosensors', 'Sensitivity', 'Optical variables control', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical refraction']","['High sensitivity', 'low limit of detection (LOD)', 'low-cost optical biosensors', 'optical cavity-based biosensor (OCB)', 'point-of-care biosensors', 'refractive index (RI) detection']"
"The capacity of overhead transmission lines is fixed and determined by the physical properties of the line, which are estimated based on worst-case weather scenarios. Exceeding the capacity limit can cause the conductor to increase the sag excessively, bringing it too close to the ground and creating a safety risk. Real-time monitoring of the sag value enables dynamic capacity configuration, thereby reducing safety risks and improving the efficiency of the transmission line. Distributed acoustic sensing based on Chirped-Pulse Phase-Sensitive Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (CP-ΦOTDR) can be used to measure the vibration induced by wind on the cable line taking advantage of the optical fiber already deployed in the power line. An analysis of the recovered strain in the frequency domain reveals multiple frequency components related to the cable’s current mechanical state. By identifying the fundamental frequency, it becomes possible to quantitatively calculate the sag. Tracking the central frequency of each span allows for the monitoring of the sag for each span of the line using just one single-end interrogator.","['Optical fiber cables', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Sensors', 'Strain', 'Vibrations', 'Monitoring']","['distributed acoustic sensing', 'overhead line monitoring', 'phase-sensitive OTDR', 'Rayleigh scattering', 'sag measurement']"
"It has been about 20 years since the disruptive appearance of the first time-of-flight (ToF) cameras. Since then, ToF imaging has progressively evolved. Nowadays, ToF sensors have broken the barrier of the 1-megapixel resolution, and a significant number of high-resolution ToF cameras have appeared in the market. To provide a better understanding of their performance and applications, we experimentally evaluate three state-of-the-art high-resolution ToF cameras such as Azure Kinect, Helios2, and S100D, together with the solid-state LiDAR L515. We perform various experiments to examine some key parameters, such as warm-up times, accuracy, precision, lateral and axial resolutions, edge noise, unsteady scenes, and modulated waveform and optical power. Our evaluation draws various conclusions: S100D shows fluctuations within 1 mm after being powered up while the others require warm-up times. Azure Kinect, Helios2, and L515 can achieve precision within 2 mm in a measuring range of 0.5–3 m. Helios2 and S100D are more severely affected by dynamic scenes. Finally, the point clouds (PCs) generated for a white panel at a distance of 1.5 m show that flying pixels are present in all cameras, being this problem less acute for the L515.","['Cameras', 'Imaging', 'Three-dimensional displays', 'Performance evaluation', 'Laser radar', 'Lighting', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization']","['3-D imaging', 'depth imaging', 'high-resolution', 'metrological validation', 'time-of-flight (ToF)']"

"Good manufacturing practice for medicinal products is laid down in several guidelines and Directives of the European Commission. Those regulations imply, among other aspects, that medicinal product manufacturers have to ensure that the final products are fit for their intended use and do not place patients at risk due to the inadequate safety, quality, or efficacy. For the case of manufacturing of pharmaceutical blisters, the attainment of this quality objective often leads to the resourcing of qualified personnel for final visual verification of the blister pack content. The need for inline content verification of pharmaceutical blisters asks therefore for sensors that provide fast, noncontact, and accurate chemical information of each individual blister content. Here, we report on a quantum cascade laser (QCL)-based blister-verification sensor. The verification principle is substance chemical identification by means of backscattering mid-infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The light source is a palm-size wavelength-tunable mid-IR QCL with $\sim $ 1-kHz tuning speed. The blister content verification uses machine vision to obtain the required position information for each individual content and fast spatial scanning facilitated by a two-axis galvanometer scanner. Diffuse reflectance mid-IR spectra are acquired at each location, and their classification is conducted instantaneously. Different classifier approaches are evaluated and discussed including machine learning and standard cross correlation to Fourier-transform-IR (FTIR) data. Altogether, this sensor is capable of scanning a standard 12-pill blister pack in $\sim $ 0.3 s, whereas this scanning time is essentially related to the desired classification accuracy, but not to the spectral resolution, which is fixed. Using machine learning classification, 100% identification accuracy is demonstrated for 13 different medication types (i.e., with different chemical nature), whereas only 97.4% identification accuracy is achieved by standard cross correlation to FTIR data. The used pills have all similar size, shape, and color, so that classification by visual inspection is barely possible.","['Quantum cascade lasers', 'Sensors', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Chemicals', 'Belts', 'Measurement by laser beam', 'Visualization']","['Chemical verification of pharmaceuticals', 'laser spectroscopy', 'mid-infrared (IR) spectroscopy', 'noncontact chemical verification', 'point-of-interest (POI) spectroscopy']"
"This work presents a portable system developed to perform biochemical analyses requiring both temperature sensing for the thermal sample treatment and optical sensing to detect the analyte. To achieve this goal, we coupled a system-on-glass, hosting on a single glass substrate a thin film transparent heater and two temperature sensors, with interface electronics able to drive the heating source and control the temperature. The system-on-glass has been optimized to ensure temperature uniformity better than ±1.4 °C over a large-area (6 cm 2 ) and sensor resolution better than 0.01 °C. Moreover, the presented device operates at a remarkably low power of only 2.4 W/cm 2 to achieve a temperature of 100 °C, significantly below the power requirements of most comparable devices available on the market. The electronics has been designed to minimize electromagnetic interferences between the heater and the biological samples. The temperature-controlled platform has been enclosed in a 3D-printed black resin-made box whose dimensions are 11 cm · 10 cm · 2.4 cm, while the electronics is enclosed in a metallic box (12.55 cm · 8.05 cm · 4.32 cm), connected with the 3D-printed box by an Ethernet cable. The compactness and low weight (below 0.5 kg) of the two boxes ensures the system portability while the easy coupling of the system-on-glass with different kinds of microfluidic networks allows its employment for a large variety of biosensing applications.","['Temperature sensors', 'Heating systems', 'Sensors', 'Connectors', 'Sensor systems', 'Substrates', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization']","['Portable system', 'Temperature-controlled platform', 'Transparent heater', 'Transparent temperature sensors']"
"Neural decoding of the visual system is a subject of research interest, both to understand how the visual system works and to be able to use this knowledge in areas such as computer vision or brain-computer interfaces. Spike-based decoding is often used, but it is difficult to record data from the whole visual cortex and it requires proper pre-processing. We here propose a decoding method that combines wide-field calcium brain imaging, which allows us to obtain large-scale visualization of cortical activity with a high signal-to-noise ratio, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A mouse was presented with 10 different visual stimuli, and the activity from its primary visual cortex (V1) was recorded. A CNN we designed was then compared to other existing commonly used CNNS, that were trained to classify the visual stimuli from wide-field calcium imaging images, obtaining a weighted F1 score of more than 0.70 on the test set, showing it is possible to automatically detect what is present in the visual field of the animal.","['Visualization', 'Convolutional neural networks', 'Mice', 'Decoding', 'Calcium', 'Imaging', 'Fluorescence']","['Deep learning', 'transfer learning', 'visual cortex', 'visual prostheses', 'wide-field imaging']"
"As one of the most natural user behaviors, walking has been widely focused on developing personal identification systems due to its unique biometric authentication features. Popular visual solutions are usually affected by various environmental conditions, and their redundant user information (e.g., body type and appearance) makes it more challenging for users to maintain privacy and security. This article proposes a distance sensor-based gait identification system that uses only 1-D data with a simple system structure. Specifically, a time-of-flight (ToF) sensor was placed in front of a walking person, and a time series of distances was acquired. We extracted gait features from the data by calculating the velocity and acceleration curves and identifying individuals using a random forest (RF) classifier. We evaluated our system on ten users using leave-one-out cross validation. The average identification accuracy was 91.05% for ten users. This study shows that gait recognition is possible using only 1-D time-series data with a noncontact sensor. It can be used as a contactless identification, reducing the computational resources required for low-cost and low-power-consumption edge computing.","['Sensors', 'Feature extraction', 'Legged locomotion', 'Cameras', 'Authentication', 'Time series analysis', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization']","['Distance sensor', 'gait identification', 'privacy', 'random forest (RF)']"
"The realm of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) encompasses a broad spectrum of sensors that are integral to distributed smart manufacturing (DSM). The miscellaneous IIoT sensors deployed for DSM are distributed and operate in a hierarchical and federated structure. Nonetheless, fulfilling essential quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as ensuring security and privacy (integrity) while maintaining scalability and interoperability (robustness), poses a profound challenge for the DSM cloud service platform. Although blockchain technologies have been used to safeguard integrity, the first two generations have imposed constraints on robustness. In contrast, the third-generation blockchain, a.k.a. decentralized crosschain ecosystem, complements Web 3.0 and metaverse and can mitigate the constraints of previous generations. Moreover, blockchain-based ad hoc solutions for DSM use cases are abundant; they often suffer from limited adaptability and unique or homogeneous use cases from a software engineering perspective. A holistic architectural modeling process (AMP) leading to a software reference architecture (SRA) is preferred when alleviating ad hoc constraints. Therefore, we proposed an AMP for SRA for crosschain-based DSM that safeguards integrity while preserving robustness. In the work described in this article, we have conducted the following system—modeling process. First, we propose a novel software AMP for DSM. Second, we deduce a modeled SRA based on a crosschain. Third, we infer a modeled system architecture (SA). Empirical experiment results demonstrate that our proposed crosschain-based method outperforms the widely used on-chain-based method while achieving our objectives efficiently.","['Quality of service', 'Industrial Internet of Things', 'Computer architecture', 'Software', 'Scalability', 'Smart manufacturing', 'Security']","['Distributed smart manufacturing (DSM)', 'Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)', 'industrial metaverse', 'software modeling', 'software reference architecture (SRA)', 'Web 30']"
"We present an algorithm to estimate and quantify the uncertainty of the accelerometers' relative geometry in an inertial sensor array. We formulate the calibration problem as a Bayesian estimation problem and propose an algorithm that samples the accelerometer positions' posterior distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo. By identifying linear substructures of the measurement model, the unknown linear motion parameters are analytically marginalized, and the remaining non-linear motion parameters are numerically marginalized. The numerical marginalization occurs in a low dimensional space where the gyroscopes give information about the motion. This combination of information from gyroscopes and analytical marginalization allows the user to make no assumptions of the motion before the calibration. It thus enables the user to estimate the accelerometer positions' relative geometry by simply exposing the array to arbitrary twisting motion. We show that the calibration algorithm gives good results on both simulated and experimental data, despite sampling a high dimensional space.","['Sensor arrays', 'Accelerometers', 'Inertial sensors', 'Calibration', 'Sensors', 'Motion measurement', 'Measurement uncertainty']","['Accelerometers', 'gyroscopes', 'calibration', 'inertial sensors', 'self-calibration', 'sensor arrays', 'Bayesian estimation', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo', 'pseudo-marginal metropolis hastings', 'Rao-Blackwellization']"
"In urban dynamic environment, most of the existing works on LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are based on static scene assumption and are greatly affected by dynamic obstacles. In order to solve this problem, this article is based on fast LiDAR odometry and mapping (F-LOAM) and adopts the FA-RANSAC algorithm, improved ScanContext algorithm, and global optimization to propose a robust and fast LiDAR odometry and mapping (RF-LOAM). First, the region-growing algorithm is used to cluster the fan-shaped grids. Then, we propose the FA-RANSAC algorithm based on feature information and adaptive threshold for dynamic object removal and extract the static edge and planar feature points for the first distortion compensation. Afterward, the estimated pose is calculated by the static feature points and is used to perform the second distortion compensation. Then, the height difference and adaptive distance threshold are used to improve the accuracy of ScanContext, and the efficiency of ScanContext is improved by deleting the loop closure historical matching frames and simplifying the feature matching. Finally, global optimization is used for keyframe. The experimental tests are carried out on the KITTI datasets, Urbanloco datasets, and our Extracted dataset. The results show that compared with the state-of-the-art SLAM methods, our method can not only accurately complete dynamic object removal and loop closure detection but also achieve more robust and faster localization and mapping in urban dynamic scenes.","['Laser radar', 'Vehicle dynamics', 'Simultaneous localization and mapping', 'Heuristic algorithms', 'Point cloud compression', 'Feature extraction', 'Location awareness']","['Autonomous vehicle', 'global optimization', 'LiDAR odometry', 'loop closure detection', 'simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)']"
"The response of perfluorinated polymer fibers (PF-POFs) in X-ray, proton, and neutron irradiation was investigated for their potential application in clinical environments. Radiation-induced attenuation (RIA) in PF-POF increases linearly with dose and PF-POF was found to be highly sensitive to all the sources of radiation used.

The PF-POF fibers also exhibit energy dependence—a useful feature in characterizing the depth dose in a proton beam. The high sensitivity of the fiber enables the development of distributed sensing in oncology and can be combined with other solid-state detectors in monitoring radiation dose in mixed radiation environments.","['Optical fibers', 'Protons', 'Neutrons', 'Sensors', 'X-rays', 'Temperature measurement', 'Scintillators']","['Cyclic transparent optical polymer (CYTOP)', 'dosimetry', 'neutron', 'optical fiber', 'optical sensor', 'proton therapy', 'radiation-induced attenuation (RIA)', 'X-ray']"

"This article presents a novel method enabling point-of-care (POC) testing of thiocyanate concentration in saliva. Thiocyanate is an important biological marker; its levels are linked with diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. Hence, monitoring this marker frequently can positively impact users’ lives. In the proposed setup, the goal is a semiquantitative reading of thiocyanate concentration from colorimetric assays in solution; the user-friendly, yet accurate readout procedure relies on a smartphone camera and is designed to be robust against moderate changes in indoor lighting conditions. The readout procedure exploits the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to fully profit from a setup involving a custom color chart and the assay vial. Thus, a data-driven strategy is adopted to deal with color distortions caused both by lighting conditions and by postprocessing operations embedded in the smartphone camera. A neural architecture search (NAS) procedure explicitly tuned for the problem at hand drove the design of the custom CNN architecture. The method has been tested using a collection of real-world data and compared with existing approaches.

"Sensor devices in future wireless communication systems such as beyond fifth generation (Beyond 5G) and sixth generation (6G) require highly accurate location information. Owing to high power consumption and cost, global navigation satellite system receivers may not be installed on sensor devices, requiring the localization of sensor devices on a wireless sensor network (WSN). In many WSN applications, a spatially dense sensor installation is required to achieve satisfactory coverage. When object detection-type sensor devices are installed at high density, the responses of spatially proximate sensors are highly correlated. In other words, these sensor responses indirectly include location information. Based on this consideration, we proposed a sensor localization method using the spatial correlation of nongeotagged sensor response data and evaluated its performance. Our method enables location estimation from the response data obtained during environmental monitoring, even for sensors that are not equipped with range functions. The simulation experiments showed that a more accurate sensor localization is possible with an error of 1 m using a wider sensor detection range, even with rough proximity pair ratio settings. In addition, we verified that there is a trade-off between localizability and observability during environmental monitoring, such as the visualization of vehicle positions from sensor responses. Our proposed method may be applied to future urban environments with a large number of sensor devices installed for environmental monitoring.","['Sensors', 'Location awareness', 'Wireless sensor networks', 'Correlation', 'Sensor systems', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Fingerprint recognition']","['Connectivity-based localization', 'Proximity', 'Sensor localization', 'Spatial correlation']"
"In this study, a new greedy sensor selection algorithm with a cost constraint is proposed based on a nondominated-solution-based multiobjective greedy (NMG) method, and its performance is investigated by comparing it with a previously proposed method. The cost function is simultaneously considered with the D-optimality criterion, and the sensor set is selected based on the idea of the nondominated solution. Although a multiobjective optimization method for sensor selection with a cost constraint was previously considered based on the linear combination of the objectives, it requires a hyperparameter that determines the balance between the actual objective and the cost of the optimization. On the other hand, the proposed algorithm can obtain the Pareto solution without tuning the balance between the actual objective and the cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on the three different real datasets that are related to the sea surface temperature field, the flowfield around an airfoil, and the combustion field in a rocket chamber. A binary cost function is virtually imposed for each potential sensor location, and a sensor selection problem with a cost constraint is simulated. The results of the numerical experiments demonstrated that the NMG method could field a Pareto solution, and the objective values of almost all the sensor sets at a certain cost selected by the proposed method are superior to those selected by the previous method.","['Sensors', 'Costs', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Cost function', 'Greedy algorithms', 'Sensor placement', 'Sea measurements']","['Cost constraint', 'data-driven sensor selection', 'greedy algorithm', 'multiobjective optimization']"
"We discuss the shape estimation of moving target objects using distributed ranging sensors. Due to the inability to carefully design sensor locations or assign global positioning systems (GPS) to inexpensive sensors, it is often necessary to assume that the sensor locations and target object locations are unknown. Although methods have been developed that can be applied in such situations, the sensing results are assumed to include no noise and cannot be applied to practical situations in which sensing noise exists. We propose a method of estimating the whole shape of a moving target object in the presence of sensing noise. Our method analyzes continuous reports on the measured distance of a target object from distributed sensors and determines the sensing directions of sensors using a novel algorithm, which we developed inspired by the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. On the basis of the obtained sensing directions, the whole shape of the object can be estimated.

"Minimally invasive implantation of subdural electrodes can dramatically benefit the patients with various neurological diseases. In modern clinical practice, the implantation procedure of the electrode arrays remains traumatic for patients and increases postoperative infection risk. Here we report a design and insertion technique of thermally activated shape-memory polymer-based electrode array that can recover up to ten times length deformation. The compressed four-centimeter wide array can be easily packed into a three-millimeter diameter tube and subsequently deployed thought five-millimeter opening in a restricted space between a brain phantom and a simulated skull. The mechanical properties of the developed array are comparable to the materials traditionally employed for the purpose, and the electrical and signal recording properties are preserved after shape deformation and recovery. Additionally, the array is biocompatible and exhibits conformability to a curvy brain surface. The results demonstrate that insertion of the electrode array through a small hole into a restricted space similar to subdural cavity is possible, which may inspire future solution of minimal invasive implantation for patients suffering from epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or tetraplegia.","['Electrodes', 'Switched mode power supplies', 'Shape', 'Polymers', 'Phantoms', 'Electron tubes', 'Strain']","['Electrodes', 'minimally invasive implantation', 'poly(ε-caprolactone)', 'shape memory polymer', 'smart materials']"
"A new measurement method has been developed that enables an acoustic detection of individual coarse mode particles (aerodynamic particle diameter > 1 \boldsymbol~ \mu \text{m} ) by impaction on a piezo transducer. The aerosol is accelerated and each momentum transfer by a particle is measured as a characteristic pulse in the transducer signal whose amplitude is directly proportional to the particle mass. The current single particle mass detection limit is approximately 50 picograms, which corresponds to an aerodynamic particle diameter of \boldsymbol \sim 5 \boldsymbol~ \mu \text{m} . The measurement technique allows a direct in-situ mass measurement of single coarse mode particles that is unique because it is based on first principles, is relatively simple and less prone to measurement artefacts compared to other methods. This particle mass measurement is independent of assumptions on particle properties like shape, density or refractive index. This technology is of interest for scientific, industrial and health-related monitoring applications as different sources of atmospheric aerosols can be identified via size-resolved mass measurements. Challenges to be overcome include a further lowering of the detection limit, eliminating systematic errors from bouncing phenomena, optimizing the correct mass assignment as well as improving the robustness against sensor vibrations and acoustic noise. In addition, the complete sensor should be portable and affordable. With the future goal to detect submicron particles, coincidence and a reduction of the impactor’s cutoff diameter additionally become important issues.","['Atmospheric measurements', 'Particle measurements', 'Aerosols', 'Pollution measurement', 'Aerodynamics', 'Acoustics', 'Transducers']","['Air pollution', 'aerosol particles', 'coarse mode', 'impaction', 'acoustic']"

"In this work, we propose several time-of-flight (ToF) sensing schemes which tackle the challenge of covering very-wide areas and long ranges in nearly real time, with relatively simple implementation and low associated computational load. We thoroughly describe two methodologies for the resolution of the inverse problem. First, we extend a greedy algorithm, such as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), by considering an initial refinement of the spatial domain in which the signal recovery is performed. Then, we propose various nonadaptive techniques for the construction of the sensing matrices, relying on the optimization of coherence and density. We further develop them by including an additional verification step which accounts for the noninstantaneous transitions from one element to another of the code and avoids any possible coincidence between rising and falling edges which may degrade the coherence. We also investigate the upper super-resolution limit, the over-sampling rate which yields unitary coherence, by considering the instrument response function (IRF) of the ToF sensor. Second, we expand an adaptive sensing scheme in which the rows of the sensing matrix are generated accounting for the information from previous measurements, such as adaptive progressive edge growth algorithm (APEG), by considering several groups of signals during the adaptation of the sensing matrices. The signals are then individually recovered for each pixel via OMP over the identified joint signal support. We validate the proposed methodologies by numerical simulations over datasets from stereo and ToF cameras.","['Sensors', 'Matching pursuit algorithms', 'Cameras', 'Imaging', 'Coherence', 'Signal resolution', 'Sensor arrays']","['Adaptive compressive sensing (CS)', 'imaging sensors', 'sparsity-awareness', 'time-of-flight (ToF)']"
"Accurate estimation of gait phases during walking is a crucial prerequisite for both extracting clinically meaningful gait parameters and delivering gait-based feedback control information to rehabilitation devices. In addition, speed variation appears in our daily walking locomotion. However, most existing IMU-related methods based on heuristic algorithms were reported to be sensitive to walking speed changes. To address this problem, in this study, we presented a temporal convolutional network (TCN) based approach for automatic and robust recognition of gait phases across multi-scene ambulation and different walking speeds. We collected data on both real-world overground walking experiments and public treadmill datasets to validate the performance in terms of the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method. By comparing our method with six machine learning models and two neural network models, our method achieves 97% accuracy in gait phase estimation for both overground and treadmill walking, outperforming all compared benchmarks. It also excelled in both model generalizability evaluation and velocity robustness comparison tests over the other two neural networks. Notably, TCN can achieve 91 % accuracy in velocity robustness tests and outperformed fully convolutional network (FCN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) in mean square error comparison (p<0.05).

"Wearable sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) will be two buzzwords that will be heard commonly in the coming decades. The combination of these two technologies soon will create a great revolution in applications that require motion recognition, such as health care, sports, and entertainment. The development of technology has made wearable sensors one of the most basic tools for human motion analysis. We believe that IoT is the most powerful complement to the use of wearable sensors in the analysis of human body motion. Using wearable IoT, all necessary human data will be collected and delivered via the Internet to the experts who can make accurate decisions about the type of activity, falling situations, freezing of gait (fog), and so on. In this article, the human motion analysis is presented in a chart and is divided into two parts: movement measurement and movement classification. However, this article focuses on movement classification that includes three subsections, gait analysis (GA), gesture recognition (GR), and human activity recognition (HAR), and is closely related to human motion recognition. In this article, our goal is to first acquaint the reader with the important steps required to classify the movement of the human body by wearable sensors and then by using tables to determine the most used algorithms and methods for each step. After briefly reviewing IoT concepts, directions for further research will be provided.","['Sensors', 'Wearable sensors', 'Sensor phenomena and characterization', 'Motion analysis', 'Temperature sensors', 'Gesture recognition', 'Temperature measurement']","['Activity recognition', 'gait analysis (GA)', 'gesture recognition (GR)', 'wearable sensors']"
"This paper presents the development of positioning quality metrics for common Received Signal Strength (RSS) based localization systems like those based on Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), Bluetooth or ZigBee. Therefore, common algorithms are investigated and the necessary statistical foundations are elaborated. A confidence area and an associated probability, which are reflected by the metric, are utilized for estimating the quality of the position estimate. It is shown that the algorithm in place strongly influences these statistical parameters. Therefore, for four frequently employed techniques the metrics are elaborated and the modifications for other variants are explained. With the help of manifold simulations we show the meaningfulness of our strategy. As an example, the error of our approach is below 5% for Proximity, a frequently applied algorithm. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that our results can be utilized even in sophisticated multi-path environments.","['Measurement', 'Antennas', 'Wireless LAN', 'Channel models', 'Simultaneous localization and mapping', 'Global Positioning System']","['Localization', 'positioning', 'received signal strength', 'RSS', 'positioning quality', 'metric', 'confidence area']"
