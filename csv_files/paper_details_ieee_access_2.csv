"Globally, wind energy is growing rapidly and has received huge consideration to fulfill global energy requirements. An accurate wind power forecasting is crucial to achieve a stable and reliable operation of the power grid. However, the unpredictability and stochastic characteristics of wind power affect the grid planning and operation adversely. To address these concerns, a substantial amount of research has been carried out to introduce an efficient wind power forecasting approach. Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have demonstrated high precision, better generalization performance and improved learning capability, thus can be ideal to handle unstable, inflexible and intermittent wind power. Recently, AI-based hybrid approaches have become popular due to their high precision, strong adaptability and improved performance. Thus, the goal of this review paper is to present the recent progress of AI-enabled hybrid approaches for wind power forecasting emphasizing classification, structure, strength, weakness and performance analysis. Moreover, this review explores the various influential factors toward the implementations of AI-based hybrid wind power forecasting including data preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameters adjustment, training algorithm, activation functions and evaluation process. Besides, various key issues, challenges and difficulties are discussed to identify the existing limitations and research gaps. Finally, the review delivers a few selective future proposals that would be valuable to the industrialists and researchers to develop an advanced AI-based hybrid approach for accurate wind power forecasting toward sustainable grid operation.",[],[]
"This paper proposes an artificial intelligence integrated (AI) fractional order robust control for a DFIG based wind energy conversion system. To reduce the chattering phenomena in the excitation signal, fuzzy system is employed for the adaptive adjustment of the discontinuous control gain while preserving the robustness of the closed-loop system. The stability of the closed loop system with fuzzy fractional order robust control (FFORC) is ensured using fractional order Lyapunov system. The proposed FFORC control scheme is tested using processor in the loop (PIL) experiment.MATLAB/Simulink environment is used to emulate DFIG based wind energy system and a Texas Instrument (TI) DSP320F37D processor is used for interfacing the proposed control scheme with the emulated DFIG model in Simulink environment. System performance under the proposed FFORC scheme is compared with classical sliding mode control(SMC).The experimental results justifies the superiority of the proposed FFORC control scheme under all test conditions.Under ideal condition and with the proposed FFORC control scheme, the speed tracking error is approximately zero while with SMC method the peak tracking error is 0.4 radian/s. Similarly the active and reactive powers tracking is smooth with the proposed control system, while with SMC method the reactive power oscillates on both sides of the reference and it reaches 0.01 kVAR on positive side and -0.01kVAR on the negative side of the plot.Under parameters variation, system with FFORC control scheme offers minimum steady state error which is about 0.01 radian/s, while in case of SMC with saturation function a peak value of 0.6 radian/s is recorded. In case of SMC with sgn function, the speed tracking error is around 0.1 radian/s.Moreover the proposed FFORC scheme exhibits minimum chattering.","['Doubly fed induction generators', 'Wind turbines', 'Rotors', 'Wind energy', 'Stators', 'Generators', 'Torque']","['Wind energy', 'artificial intelligence', 'fuzzy control', 'fractional order control', 'DFIG']"
"Driver fatigue is one of the causal factors for traffic accidents. Actions of facial units convey various information from our brains. This paper proposed a comprehensive approach to explore whether pattern of sequences of the driver's facial landmarks changes from the alert start to the fatigue state. A driving-simulator-based experiment was designed and conducted. Videos of 21 participants' faces were recorded during the experiment, together with subjective and others' assessment of the level of alertness. Sequences of eye aspect ratio (EAR) and mouth aspect ratio (MAR) were calculated based on facial landmarks. Totally 21 feature candidates including Percent eye-closure over a fixed time window (PERCLOS), blink rate, statistics of blink duration, closing speed, reopening speed and number of yawns were extracted. A mental fatigue assessment model is proposed after feature selection. Four machine learning algorithms were used to build the assessment model of fatigue. The best performance was achieved by logistic regression, with cross-validation accuracies of 83.7% and 85.4%. This study may contribute to the development of driver fatigue monitoring system for automotive ergonomics.","['Fatigue', 'Roads', 'Vehicles', 'Circadian rhythm', 'Electroencephalography', 'Support vector machines']","['Classification algorithm', 'driverâ€™s mental fatigue', 'eye blink parameters', 'facial landmarks']"
"Driving behavior recognition is a challenging task that exploits the acceleration and angular velocity information of the vehicle collected by smartphone to identify various driving events. Traditional methods usually extract hand-crafted features from raw data, leading to under-explored temporal features of driving behaviors. To address the issue of hand-designed limitation for features, this paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework to automatically extract the features of driving behaviors. The mechanism behind our method is to model temporal features, capture salient structure features, and explore the correlation among the high-dimensional sensor data by fusing convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) with an attention unit. Moreover, a novel approach is introduced to build driving behavior dataset, which considers the effect of gravity in modeling smartphone sensor data. Subsequently, sensor data with device position independence is collected, and six types of driving events (straight driving, static, left turn, right turn, breaking, and acceleration) are annotated, which provides rich sensor information compared with other methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms other competing methods significantly, which possesses good generalization ability in the identification of driving behaviors.","['Feature extraction', 'Accelerometers', 'Acceleration', 'Data models', 'Gyroscopes', 'Recurrent neural networks', 'Vehicles']","['Artificial intelligence', 'artificial neural networks', 'risk analysis', 'attention mechanism', 'CNN', 'RNN', 'driving behavior recognition', 'smartphone sensor data']"
"In the complex underwater environment, the performance of microelectro-mechanical system sensors is degraded sharply and the errors will become much larger. Especially when the magnetic sensor is disturbed by the external magnetic interference, the measurements become unobservable so that the navigation information is estimated erroneously. To solve this problem, the paper proposes a novel method fusing Quasi-Newton and cubature Kalman filter (QNCKF). This method takes full advantage of the computation efficiency of the Quasi-Newton and the estimation accuracy of CKF in the case of nonlinearity. The performance of QNCKF is verified theoretically and evaluated by experiments. The results indicate that when the magnetic sensor is interfered, QNCKF and CKF still can maintain high estimation accuracy, whereas the extended Kalman filter performs poorly. Moreover, QNCKF is superior to CKF in the aspect of computational efficiency. Therefore, QNCKF has the highest priority in terms of estimation accuracy and computational efficiency among the three methods and it is more suitable to be applied to the underwater gliders than the other two methods.","['Magnetic sensors', 'Estimation', 'Navigation', 'Computational efficiency', 'Oceans', 'Kalman filters']","['Underwater glider', 'inertial navigation', 'magnetic sensor', 'Quasi-Newton', 'magnetic interference', 'attitude estimation']"
"An important part of the human-computer interaction process is speech emotion recognition (SER), which has been receiving more attention in recent years. However, although a wide diversity of methods has been proposed in SER, these approaches still cannot improve the performance. A key issue in the low performance of the SER system is how to effectively extract emotion-oriented features. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, an autoencoder with emotion embedding, to extract deep emotion features. Unlike many previous works, instance normalization, which is a common technique in the style transfer field, is introduced into our model rather than batch normalization. Furthermore, the emotion embedding path in our method can lead the autoencoder to efficiently learn a priori knowledge from the label. It can enable the model to distinguish which features are most related to human emotion. We concatenate the latent representation learned by the autoencoder and acoustic features obtained by the openSMILE toolkit. Finally, the concatenated feature vector is utilized for emotion classification. To improve the generalization of our method, a simple data augmentation approach is applied. Two publicly available and highly popular databases, IEMOCAP and EMODB, are chosen to evaluate our method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves significant performance improvement compared to other speech emotion recognition systems.","['Feature extraction', 'Speech recognition', 'Emotion recognition', 'Spectrogram', 'Noise reduction', 'Hidden Markov models', 'Acoustics']","['Speech emotion recognition', 'autoencoder', 'emotion embedding', 'instance normalization']"
"Traffic jams in large cities, in addition to having a very high economic cost, cause an increase in emissions generated by vehicles over the same route being driven under normal conditions. In recent years, there has been a rapid evolution in the technologies applied to the field of autonomous vehicles. There are currently commercial solutions for assisted driving and semi-autonomous driving systems, with very favorable forecasts for reaching a completely autonomous vehicle scenario in the coming decades. This new environment generates opportunities and challenges to reduce congestion in scenarios with autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles. This paper focuses on the automatic optimization of the passage of vehicles through intersections. The intersections are one of the most conflict-generating elements in a traffic network. This type of conflicts arises because the intersections must manage multiple traffic flows with different priorities and preferences, often leading to traffic jams. The problem has been addressed by proposing three mechanisms to model any type of intersection, to calculate the roads with fewer points of conflict between their inputs and outputs, and to optimize the arrival rate of vehicles using a Genetic Algorithm to achieve the maximum performance of the intersection. To validate this solution, a cellular automata simulator has been developed, which can be adapted to both autonomous and conventional vehicle scenarios and can provide realistic results when certain conditions are met. The results obtained have been compared with other traditional solutions (priority and traffic lights) using microscopic traffic simulations, and with those obtained in other studies showing the advantages of the proposed system. The proposed systems achieve a throughput improvement between 9.21% and 36.98% compared with the traditional solutions.","['Optimization', 'Autonomous vehicles', 'Genetic algorithms', 'Roads', 'Automata', 'Automation', 'Urban areas']","['Autonomous systems', 'autonomous vehicles', 'genetic algorithms', 'traffic congestion']"
