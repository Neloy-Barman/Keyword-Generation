"Recently, a novel type of pulse formation known as dissipative soliton resonance (DSR) has been demonstrated in mode-locked fiber lasers. However, emphasis has been given to scalar DSR pulses, and their polarization dynamics have not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we study numerically the vector nature of DSR pulses in a fiber laser mode-locked by the nonlinear polarization rotation technique. Our results enrich the vector nature of DSR pulses in mode-locked fiber lasers.",[],[]

"The dynamic refractive-index-change behavior of the light-induced process in an Mn:Fe:KTN crystal illuminated by a focused light sheet can be observed experimentally by digital holographic interferometry. By numerically retrieving a series of sequential phase maps from recording digital holograms, the spatial and temporal evolution of the light-induced refractive-index-change distribution inside the material is visualized in situ and monitored in a quantitative and in full field way. With this technique, the effect of recording parameters, such as writing laser power and polarization, bias voltage, temperature, and writing time, on the Mn:Fe:KTN crystal in the photorefractive effect can be explored. Therefore, optimized recording parameters will be achieved according to the dynamic behavior. The method provides an access to explore the evolution of the photorefractive (PR) effect of electrooptic crystal under various situations.","['Refractive index', 'Crystals', 'Writing', 'Optical interferometry', 'Laser beams', 'Temperature measurement', 'Holography']","['Mn:Fe:KTN crystal', 'photorefractive effect', 'digital holographic interferometry']"
"We experimentally investigate the wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) transmission of single-carrier 400G based on an orthogonal optical time-division multiplexed (orth-OTDM) 80-GBd polarization-division multiplexed (PDM) 8 quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) signal. The 80-GBd 8QAM signal is generated using the OTDM method based on two tributaries of time-domain orthogonal pulses with 40-GBd 8QAM signals. Full-band coherent detection is utilized with digital signal processing based on a single broadband receiver for the 80-GBd signals. The WDM transmission performance of single-carrier 400G signals within different channel grids and carrier spacing is also investigated. Finally, four 400G channels, each carrying an 80-GBd PDM-8QAM signal within 100-, 80-, and 75-GHz grids, are successfully transmitted over 1600-, 800-, and 400-km standard single-mode fibers with Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA)-only amplification below a pre-Forward error correction (FEC) bit-error rate (BER) of 2.4×10 -2 (20% soft-decision FEC), respectively.

"To track vital signs on the wrist, a wearable system, named WrisTee, has been developed for remote health monitoring. Using three optical sensors with four light sources, WrisTee allows users to measure 12 photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals at three locations on the radial artery. Two types of PPG signals with opposite polarities were discovered and designated as in-phase and invert-phase signals. We provided a unified viewpoint regarding their differences based on the Beer−Lambert law, and showed that both signals can be used for heart monitoring using data analyzed from a selected subject. Using reflective pulse-transition time (R-PTT) and the standard deviation of R-PTT (σR-PTT), we proposed a method for selecting the optimal wavelength to achieve the best quality signal, thus minimizing storage requirements, power resources, and computational costs. We conducted an experiment on ten subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. Our results demonstrated that WrisTee is capable of finding the optimal positions and wavelengths for monitoring vital signs. To automatically detect the PPG phases, six machine learning (ML) models were explored to assess their accuracy for PPG-phase classification. The experimental results show that a convolutional neural network can be the best candidate for phase classification. Hence, it can be integrated into WrisTee for noninvasive health monitoring such as heart rate, heart rate variability, or blood pressure. Our work paves a new direction in bio-signal medical researches by adopting in-phase and invert-phase PPGs for healthcare monitoring.","['Sensors', 'Optical sensors', 'Monitoring', 'Biomedical monitoring', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Wrist', 'Sensor arrays']","['Blood pressure', 'in-phase', 'invert-phase', 'machine learning', 'multi-wavelength', 'photoplethysmogrpahy', 'pulse transition time', 'vital signs', 'wearable']"

"An approach for wideband phase noise measurement of microwave signal sources is proposed based on all-optical microwave signal processing. In the proposed scheme, an optical carrier is sequentially modulated by the signal under test (SUT) in a phase modulator and a dual-polarization modulator to generate two +1st-order sidebands with orthogonal polarizations. A time delay is introduced between two sidebands by a span of low-loss optical fiber. Combined with a polarization controller and a polarizer, photonic microwave downconversion with a desired phase shift and time delay can be realized after photodetection, and the phase noise of the SUT can be calculated thereafter. Since all the microwave signal processing functions in the conventional photonic-delay-line-based phase noise measurement system are implemented in the optical domain, the proposed scheme has a large operational bandwidth and a high measurement sensitivity. In the experimental demonstration, accurate phase noise measurement of SUTs is achieved in a frequency range of 10-35 GHz, and a phase noise floor as low as −132.16 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz is obtained.","['Microwave measurement', 'Microwave photonics', 'Microwave theory and techniques', 'Phase noise', 'Optical variables measurement', 'Optical polarization', 'Phase measurement']","['All-optical microwave signal processing', 'frequency discriminator', 'microwave photonics', 'phase noise']"

"In monolithic photonic integrated circuits (PICs), an optimized active/passive integration is needed to provide efficient coupling and low amount of interface reflections between amplifiers and passive components. A 1300 nm semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) on InP substrate and optimized for butt-joint reflections is investigated. Material performance were assessed from measurements of broad area lasers. Room temperature operation reveals 1.2 W single facet output power with threshold current around 100 A/cm 2 per well. Characteristic temperatures of T 0 = 75 K and T 1 = 294 K were obtained. A compact model description of the SOA, suitable for the design of PICs and rate equation analysis, was applied to parametrize the unsaturated gain measurements. Current injection efficiency of 0.65, transparency carrier density of 0.57 10 18 cm −3 , and free carrier absorption losses up to 15 cm −1 were extracted from fitting the data. The model is verified with measurements of optical gain saturation. A modal gain of 15 dB for a 600 μm long narrow ridge SOA leads to output saturation power higher than 30 mW at 7 kA/cm 2 . This building block contributes to the development of an InP monolithic integration technology in the 1300 nm range, which can enable the use of photonic integrated circuits in many kind of applications.","['Semiconductor optical amplifiers', 'Optical waveguides', 'Indium phosphide', 'III-V semiconductor materials', 'Strain', 'Reflection', 'Optical reflection']","['InP', 'monolithic integrated circuits', 'o-band telecommunications', 'semiconductor optical amplifiers', 'semicondu- ctor device modeling']"

"In this paper, a novel two-dimensional (2D) generalized optical spatial modulation (GOSM) scheme is proposed for multiple-input multiple-output optical wireless communication (MIMO-OWC) systems. By grouping multiple successive time slots as one time block, 2D GOSM mapping can be performed not only in the space domain but also in the time domain. Specifically, two types of 2D GOSM mapping schemes are designed, including 2D-1 and 2D-2 GOSM mappings. Moreover, to address the high complexity issue of optimal joint maximum-likelihood (ML) detection and the noise amplification and error propagation issues of zero-forcing-based ML (ZF-ML) detection, a deep neural network (DNN)-aided detection scheme is further designed for 2D GOSM systems. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed 2D GOSM scheme with deep learning-aided detection for high-speed and low-complexity MIMO-OWC systems.

"The inter-data center links are meeting the challenge of increasing transmission capacity continuously.

Each 4-f imaging system is capable of collimating and adaptively splitting an input optical beam emerging from an optical fiber and then coupling the split beams into different output fiber ports, thus realizing dynamic optical power splitting. The Opto-VLSI processor is driven by optimized multicasting phase holograms that adaptively split an incident laser beam along different angles; thus, user-defined splitting ratios can be achieved.

"Accurate probing, monitoring, and controlling the pH level is critical in different fields. In the last two decades, optical fiber/waveguide-based pH sensors have been widely investigated with the aim of further enhancement of sensitivity and miniaturization. Here, we propose a novel and cost-effective pH sensor based on polymer waveguide Bragg grating, addressing main aspects like sensitivity enhancement, miniaturization, narrow band response, and stable performance. The large evanescent field due to metal under cladding and high index coating combined with excellent penetration depth match with pH-sensitive polymer coating of poly-acrylic acid/poly-allylamine hydrochloride (PAA/PAH) in an aqueous medium, ensures a sensitivity of 10.4 nm/pH for a pH range of 4 to 7, two orders higher than all reported Bragg grating pH sensors to our knowledge. A narrow band (∼1 nm) response has been ensured by low propagation loss of the TE mode. Further, the variations in sensitivity and peak reflectivity are within 3% for a ±10% inaccuracy in various structural parameters, reflecting excellent fabrication tolerances.

"Previously, when selecting silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for use in visible light communications (VLC) systems the bandwidth of the SiPM has been a high priority. However, results of experiments on VLC receivers containing two different sizes of commercially available SiPMs show that, if equalization is used and the OOK bit time is less than one third of the duration of its output pulses, the SiPMs bandwidth doesn't significantly impact the receiver's performance. Consequently, for these data rates the criteria used to select which SiPM to incorporate in VLC receivers should put a higher priority on their area and photon detection efficiency than on their bandwidth. In addition, for these data rates, unless the SiPM becomes non-linear, the performance of a receiver containing a SiPM can be predicted based upon Poisson statistics.","['Receivers', 'Photonics', 'Microcell networks', 'Bandwidth', 'Visible light communication', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Optical fibers']","['Optical wireless communications', 'silicon photomultiplier', 'visible light communications']"
"We propose a novel demodulation scheme based on measuring interference fringe visibility and demonstrate it using a typical Michelson interferometer (MI) configuration. The key component to achieve the scheme is a section of highly birefringent fiber (HBF) spliced into the sensing arm to function as the sensing element. The optical path difference (OPD) leads to interference fringes, while the birefringence of the HBF results in a visibility envelop. It is possible to detect measurands associated with birefringence through measuring the visibility, which is attributed to a flexible use of the fundamental principle of interferometry. As one of the potential applications, temperature sensing employing the MI configuration is performed. Moreover, the technique has the advantage of being immune to element instabilities, such as power fluctuation of the light source, phase shift of the reference arm, noise of the photo detector, and wavelength shift of the optical spectrum analyzer (OSA).

"A few mode fiber temperature sensor filled with PDMS based on vernier effect is proposed. It uses single mode fiber (SMF), few mode fiber (FMF), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to form the SMF-air microcavity-FMF-PDMS-FMF structure. It is to slot the glass capillary tube, place the two FMFs in the slot at a suitable distance, and fill the slot with PDMS multiple times and seal it. The PDMS is used as a sensing microcavity. We insert the SMF from the other end of the glass capillary tube, adjust the distance, fix the SMF and seal the connection. Two end faces of the SMF and the first FMF form an air reference microcavity. Since the refractive index of each medium is different, multiple reflective surfaces are formed to reflect. Because the second FMF is infinitely long, whose right end is beveled, it is considered that the sensor has four reflected beams. When the temperature changes, the length and refractive index of the PDMS microcavity will change, which will cause a change in the interference spectrum of the sensor. And because the vernier effect is formed by the superposition of the two microcavities, the temperature sensitivity can be amplified and the temperature can be measured with high sensitivity. The experimental results show that in the range of 40–56°C, the transmission spectrum of the sensor appears red shift with the increase of temperature, and the temperature sensitivity can reach 3.89nm/°C. The sensor is simple to manufacture, has high sensitivity, and has good application prospects.","['Sensors', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Temperature sensors', 'Optical fibers', 'Microcavities', 'Sagnac interferometers', 'Sensitivity']","['Fiber optics', 'Vernier effect', 'few mode fiber', 'temperature']"
"A layer-reduced neural network based digital backpropagation algorithm called smoothing learned digital backpropagation (smoothing-LDBP), is proposed in this paper. The smoothing-LDBP smooths the power terms in nonlinear activation functions to limit the bandwidth. The limited bandwidth of the power terms generates fewer in-band distortions, thus reduces the required layer for a given equalization performance. Simulation results show that the required layers of smoothing-LDBP are reduced by approximately 62% at 6.7% HD-FEC compared with learned digital backpropagation. Owing to the layer reduction, the latency and the complexity are reduced by 69% and 51%, respectively.

"The features of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as strong manoeuvrability, small size, and light weight, make them considered to participate in free space optical (FSO) quantum communication, becoming an important part of the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network. However, research reports on small-sized drones based long-range optical quantum link are few. A major challenge is that traditional opto-mechanical structure is difficult to adapt to small UAV platforms. Here, a lower size, weight, and power (SWaP) acquisition and tracking system prototype is developed, and its greatest advantage is that the system can be easily integrated into small flying platforms and quickly build a long-distance quantum communication link. The prototype weighs less than 8 kg. A small-sized two-axis mirror mechanism is designed for wide-range acquisition and tracking. Moreover, the system can automatically point to ground station. The SWaP acquisition and tracking system can support quantum key distribution (QKD) link and general FSO link by drones. In the 7 km air-to-ground demonstration, the acquisition and tracking system prototype is tested in practice, which is suspended under the small six-rotor UAV platform, and a special passive vibration isolation unit is added in between.

"The Y field of view of an off-axis optical system is generally less than 1°. Scholars usually use a freeform surface to achieve a rectangular field of view imaging. However, it adds to the difficulty of processing, testing, assembling, and adjusting, and at the same time has the drawbacks of high manufacturing costs and long processing cycles. In view of the above problems, this paper presents a computational imaging design method for expanding the Y field of view of an off-axis optical system. This method analyzes the aberration characteristics of the optical system, creates a point spread function model based on the wavefront aberration theory and Zernike polynomials, and processes images using a spatial variation deconvolution algorithm. In this paper, we used this method to simulate an off-axis three-mirror optical system with a focal length of 260 mm, the f-number of 2.5, and a field of view of 8° × 1° and compare the images before and after processing. The results show that the processed images have a clear outline, the overall image quality is improved, the field of view is improved to 8° × 6°, and the modulation transfer function of the entire field of view is above 0.4. The off-axis optical system rectangular field of view imaging is realized without using a freeform surface.","['Optical imaging', 'Adaptive optics', 'Optical diffraction', 'Optical surface waves', 'Optical reflection', 'Optical sensors', 'Imaging']","['Optical design', 'off-axis optical system', 'computational imaging', 'Point Spread Function (PSF)']"
"In this paper, a microstructured laser with modulated periodic microstructures for beam control is proposed for the first time. Lasers using modulated periodic microstructures can emit beam with lower vertical divergence angle for the same number of microstructures. And lasers with specific period length can transmit beam in specific direction. These lasers emitting beams with different emission directions can be integrated into an array. And this array can be used directly as a transmitter chip of LiDAR. Both simulation and experimental results show that the modulated periodic microstructures can effectively reduce the vertical divergence angle. In the experiment, the lowest vertical divergence angle of 0.88° and a large angle sweep range of 41.5° have been obtained. A horizontal divergence angle of 4.3° is achieved with the taper structure.

"A bandwidth-tunable multiband microwave photonic filter (MPF) using a strongly coupled microring resonator (MRR) with optical phase modulation is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally. Two notches of the MRR adjacent to the optical carrier break the intrinsic balance of the phase-modulated signal and then two sub-MPFs are formed thanks to the conversion from phase modulation to intensity modulation (PM-IM). The frequency responses of the two sub-MPFs are superimposed to form a passband with a fixed center frequency. Due to the periodicity of the MRR transmission spectrum, multiple passbands separated by a certain spacing appear in the frequency domain and combine to form a multiband MPF, whose bandwidth can be adjusted by tuning the wavelength of the carrier. The tunable bandwidth and shape factors ranging from 0.73 GHz to 2.73 GHz and 5.06 to 1.38 are experimentally performed. The number of passbands can be reconfigured.

"Nano antennas have a significant role in photonic nanodevices due to the ability of concentrating radiation in a small space region. The confined fields present a high sensitivity to the used materials in that regions. The electromagnetic wave models of nanoantennas usually operate in the frequency domain. However, electromagnetic wave models in the time domain are just as important and more advantageous, for example, in light pulses propagation. In this article, a new stochastic method based on the ray model of light in absorbing media is presented and light patterns on a target near a nanoantenna are obtained. The optical properties of the materials are described by their complex refractive index. When dealing with photons in the time domain, this formulation allows the calculation of the probability of a given photon movement. Different patterns, obtained with the new method, are compared with a Finite Element Tool ones, leading to model validation. The simulated structure included an aperture nanoantenna. With this method, the results show the light confinement and the extraordinary optical transmission phenomenon, meaning some photons on the target are refracted and re-transmitted by the metal. Thus, the output beam is more intense than the transmitted directly by the apertures.","['Photonics', 'Optical filters', 'Optical variables control', 'Optical surface waves', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical refraction', 'Nanoscale devices']","['Extraordinary optical transmission', 'light patterns', 'nano arrays', 'nano antennas', 'optical devices']"

"Mobility μ is essential in electronic and optoelectronic devices.

According to FF, there are three regions. When FF ≫ 1 and FF≪1, the carrier behavior follows the Fermi and Boltzmann distributions, respectively. When FF~1, the derived transition temperature of 282.4 K represents a transition point from Fermi to Boltzmann distribution, which is consistent with T c in the experiment.

"Recent research in Phase-Sensitive Optical Time Doman Reflectometry (ϕ-OTDR) has been focused, among others, on performing spatially resolved measurements with various methods including the use of frequency modulated probes.

"A simple and all-optical Doppler frequency shift (DFS) measurement system is presented. It is based on a dual-drive Mach Zehnder modulator (DDMZM) driven by a transmitted signal and an echo signal received by an antenna. A low-frequency sawtooth wave is applied to the DDMZM DC port to frequency shift the carrier and sidebands generated by the transmitted signal. Beating of a frequency-shifted transmitted signal sideband and an echo signal sideband at the photodetector produces a low-frequency electrical signal.

"In this paper, we develop a set of effective algorithms for performing efficient and accurate visible light positioning (VLP) in the presence of shot noise, which is an important component in the received optical signal yet has been largely neglected in prior works. In particular, we formulate the positioning problem as a maximum log-likelihood optimization problem, which is nonconvex so that the standard numerical algorithm such as gradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) may not be able to find the global solution. To address this, we propose a novel least-square (LS) solver that can find a sub-optimal solution to the aforementioned non-convex optimization problem. Based on the LS solver, a set of more effective algorithms can be developed to further enhance the optimality of the solution. Specifically, we consider (1) combining the LS solver with GD, giving rise to the GD-LS algorithm; and (2) applying the LS solver in an iterative manner, giving rise to the iterative LS algorithm, which is a novel and efficient positioning algorithm. Moreover, we also provide a closed-form lower bound on the positioning error based on the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLB). Numerical simulation shows that the proposed GD-LS and iterative LS algorithms cannot only achieve high positioning accuracy, but also enjoy low computation complexity: the average positioning accuracy of LS-GD is 0.009 m using computation time 0.046 s, and the iterative LS algorithm can achieve average positioning accuracy 0.023 m with 1.94\times 10^{-4} s computation time, which outperform GD and SGD method.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Iterative algorithms', 'Visible light communication', 'Optical receivers', 'Optical transmitters', 'Wireless communication', 'Thermal noise']","['Visible light positioning', 'gradient descent', 'least square', 'CRLB']"

"Time delay signature (TDS) is a key issue that affects the security performance of optical chaos communication. Currently, the autocorrelation function (ACF) and delayed mutual information (DMI) are two crucial methods to extract the TDS. Several strategies have been proposed to resist statistical analysis (i.e., ACF and DMI). However, a dynamic inverse modeling method has been proposed to identify TDS by utilizing the strong nonlinear inversion capability of deep learning, which brings about new threat. To resist this analysis, we propose a stratagem that one can increase the nonlinear dimensionality of the chaos system at the transmitter and concurrently reduce the dimensionality of transmitted signals, leading to “deficiency of data dimensionality”. A three-dimensional chaotic system is designed as the transmitter and only one-dimensional signal is transmitted for communication. Furthermore, a hybrid receiver is designed. The nonlinear model of the response system is realized by cooperation of an analog electro-optical link and a neural network in digital domain. The architecture not only destroys the possibility of TDS extraction but also preserves all necessary information required for chaos synchronization with low-complexity implementation.","['Chaos', 'Synchronization', 'Optical transmitters', 'Security', 'Optical receivers', 'Delay effects', 'Chaotic communication']","['Physical layer security', 'time delay concealment', 'deep learning']"

"Star sensor needs real-time calibration to improve its navigation accuracy. Compared with other parameters, the position of the principal point is more easily affected by the measurement error, which leads to low calibration accuracy. Conventional star sensors on-orbit calibration methods mainly rely on the angular distance(AD) between stars. The observability of the principal point in this method and the calibration accuracy is not as well as that of other parameters. In this paper, an on-orbit calibration method of star sensor based on the angular distance subtraction(ADS) is proposed. The accuracy of the on-orbit calibration is improved by increasing the observability of the principal point in the calibration process, and the feasibility of this method is verified by the observability analysis. Finally, improved angular distance subtraction(IADS) models are proposed to solve the time-consuming problem of ADS method. In order to demonstrate the performance of the IADS models, simulation calibrations are conducted. The results show that the accuracy of u0 and v0 of the IADS method is 62.7% and 15.9% higher than that of AD method when other parameters are set as nominal values.

The MPF, which is composed by a broadband optical source, an inline interferometer based on a variable optical delay line (VODL), an intensity modulator, and a dispersive element, serves as an oscillating mode selector. The oscillation frequency can be tuned by changing the differential time delay via the VODL. Due to the non-carrier-suppression effect of the selector, the oscillator can generate transmission-null-free microwave signal with widely tunable frequency range. An experiment is performed, and a tunable frequency range of 6.8 GHz is achieved.

"The resonance characteristics of the micro-coil resonator(MCR) with different turns and coupling conditions are presented, which show that the effective length of the MCR with small coupling coefficient at primary resonant is independent of the turns, and the resonance dips always appear in pairs corresponding to multiple critical-coupling because of the periodicity of coupling strength. However, complicated resonance is observed in an MCR with larger coupling coefficient and turns. The superluminal or subluminal propagation regime can be obtained respectively by adjusting the coupling condition, and the effect of loss on them in different coupling conditions is investigated. There is such a loss threshold in the critical-coupling and over-coupling conditions, near which the group refractive index abrupt changes between positive and negative extremum, and the threshold is increased by 10 5 orders of magnitude under over-coupling condition compared with critical-coupling. In view of the transmission near a resonant evolve not only with the detuning of transmission phase, but also drastically with the adjustment of coupling condition which will be modulated by the cladding refractive index and coupling length.

However, previous work has shown that machine learning models such as Gaussian processes (GP) achieve better performance and are more robust in general, particularly in presence of non-ideal environmental conditions.

"The Kerr self-focusing and group-velocity dispersion (GVD) effects play important roles when a high-power pulsed laser beam propagates from the ground through the nonlinear and dispersive atmosphere to space orbits. For an annular pulsed laser beam, the Kerr self-focusing and GVD effects on the beam quality on the target is studied in this paper. Due to self-focusing, the maximum intensity I max on the target arrives when the beam power P = P opt ( P opt is called the optimal beam power), and the intensity on the target will decrease as the beam power P increases further when P > P opt . The P opt of nanosecond and picosecond pulsed beams is lower than that of femtosecond pulsed beams, while the maximum intensity I max on the target of nanosecond and picosecond pulsed beams is higher than that of femtosecond pulsed beams. The P opt and I max of annular pulsed beams are higher than those of Gaussian pulsed beams. In addition, the B integral and the Strehl ratio are also adopted to describe the beam quality on the target. On the other hand, because of the interplay of Kerr self-focusing and GVD effects, the temporal pulse splitting and self-healing may take place on propagation, and the temporal pulse splitting may take place more than once.

"Distinct temperature-dependent dynamic behaviors of GaN-based blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are observed by use of the very-fast electrical-optical pump-probe technique. Our static and impulse response measurement results indicate that the behaviors of internal carrier dynamics under different ambient temperatures can be classified into three regimes covering a wide range of bias current densities (20-2000 A/cm 2 ). The first regime is when the bias current density ranges from low to moderate (20-100 A/cm 2 ). The measured external quantum efficiency (EQE) degrades dramatically from 57 to 44%, and the measured waveform and extracted time constants of measured impulse responses are invariable from room temperature (RT) to 200 °C, which indicates that the carrier leakage is not an issue for the observed droop phenomenon. When the bias current density further increases to near 1 kA/cm 2 , the droop phenomenon are mitigated (44 to 24%). However, a significant shortening of the measured impulse response happens under 200 °C operation due to the device-heating effect. This phenomenon is diminished when the bias current densities are further increased to over 1 kA/cm 2 , due to the screening of the piezoelectric field. The extracted time constants can also be used to explain the droop phenomenon in GaN LED under high bias currents.","['Temperature measurement', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Current density', 'Gallium nitride', 'Power measurement', 'Quantum well devices']",['Light-emitting diodes (LEDs)']

"Fast active quenching of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) is important to reduce the afterpulsing probability (APP). An option to reduce the reaction time of electronics to a SPAD's avalanche is to design a quencher exploiting bipolar transistors. A quencher in a 0.35 μm CMOS technology with a nominal supply voltage of 3.3 V, which operated with excess bias voltages up to 6.6 V, was re-designed accordingly. In the new 0.35 μm pure-silicon BiCMOS quencher, the comparator takes advantage of a bipolar differential amplifier, which additionally gives the head room to increase the width of some CMOS transistors as well. The proposed BiCMOS quencher is able to drive the load of a wire-bonded 184 μm-diameter SPAD, while the CMOS design fails. A comparison, where both chips are measured with a wire-bonded, 34 μm-diameter SPAD, shows that the BiCMOS quencher has a reaction time, which is 330 ps to 1.1 ns faster than that of the CMOS quencher.","['Single-photon avalanche diodes', 'Transistors', 'Photonics', 'BiCMOS integrated circuits', 'CMOS technology', 'Differential amplifiers', 'Switches']","['SPAD', 'active quenching', 'BiCMOS', 'CMOS']"

"We proposed a new type of distributed feedback laser with alternating active- and passive-cavities (APC DFB), which enjoys the same quantum well layer where the butt-joint re-growth process can be avoided. By utilizing the chirp characteristics of the APC DFB laser in a delayed self-heterodyne system, a chirped microwave signal with a sweep range up to 40 GHz and a sweep period of 25 μs is generated. The power fluctuation of the generated signal between 0-40 GHz within 30 minutes does not exceed 3 dB, and the scanning range fluctuates about 600 MHz. And experiment results show that the thermal efficiency of the current is always related to the working environment. In the static wavelength measurement, it is controlled by the injection current; when the chirped signal is generated, it is determined by the bias current. In particular, the waveform and the period as well as the sweep range of the generated chirped microwave signals can be accurately tuned by adjusting the modulating current, which has provided a deeper insight into the photonic generation of microwave signals.","['Masers', 'Microwave photonics', 'Frequency modulation', 'Microwave theory and techniques', 'Microwave imaging', 'Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers', 'Chirp']","['Distributed feedback laser', 'active- and passive-cavity', 'chirped microwave signals']"

"In this paper, we put forward a novel method for the management of optical collapse through controlling anomalous nonlinear diffraction (NLD) originating from the vectoral effect in metamaterials with simultaneous cubic electric and magnetic nonlinearity, particularly focusing on the unusual behaviors different from those in ordinary positive-index materials. First, NLD in metamaterials can be positive or negative, which makes it possible for us to offer greatly enhanced design freedom to manipulate the behavior of optical collapse at will. Then, it is further demonstrated that the negative NLD can arrest the catastrophic self-focusing of optical wave; however, the positive NLD will lead to the acceleration of its occurrence, as opposed to the case in ordinary positive-index materials. Our analysis is performed by directly numerically solving the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, as well as by using the modulation theory, both showing consistent results. These findings show that NLD in metamaterials can provide a more powerful tool in controlling the collapse of optical wave when compared with the corresponding case in ordinary positive-index materials.","['Metamaterials', 'Optical diffraction', 'Magnetic materials', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Optical solitons', 'Optical refraction', 'Optical variables control']","['Nonlinear optics', 'Metamaterials', 'Self-focusing']"

The finding is verified by the experimentally detected transmitted probe, multi-wave mixing, and fluorescence signals. We also find that the fluorescence signals show Autler-Townes splitting, which are observed experimentally and explained theoretically. By scanning one coupling field frequency detuning, variation of the dressing strength of another coupling field is revealed.

"Inter-cell interference (ICI) and inter-user interference (IUI) constitute a major issue towards achieving the optimum spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) performance in multi-cell visible light communication (VLC) networks. Hence, advanced multiple access techniques need to be leveraged in order to improve the provided service to the users of such interfering networks. To this end, the present contribution proposes the integration of coordinated beamforming (CB) with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in multi-cell VLC systems. Specifically, we consider the design of beamformers for the common and private streams in a coordinated manner between different attocells, which is shown to provide efficient mitigation of the incurred interference. Additionally, the formulated optimization problem aims to minimize the sum of the mean squared error across all attocells in order to jointly determine the optimum receive filters and coordinated transmit beamformers for RSMA streams. In this context, we illustrate through extensive computer simulations, which are carried out in a realistic setup that assumes noisy channel state information acquisition, the distinct flexibility and robustness of CB-based RSMA in mitigating the incurred interference. Finally, the offered results demonstrate the superiority of CB-based RSMA in terms of achievable SE and EE performance in multi-cell VLC networks compared to the conventional CB-based space division multiple access counterpart.","['Interference', 'Optimization', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Visible light communication', 'Complexity theory', 'Precoding', 'Electrical engineering']","['Coordinated beamforming', 'MIMO', 'multicell communications', 'spectral efficiency', 'optimization', 'RSMA', 'energy efficiency', 'VLC']"
"Optical multicasting has been considered resource efficient for multicast services. Light-tree and light-trail are two technologies that support optical multicasting while the former requires many splitters and thus experiences significant power loss. In this paper, we consider using the light-trail technology for the accommodation of multicast requests in elastic optical networks with adaptive modulation. For better spectrum efficiency, we consider accommodating each multicast by multiple light-trails. We formulate the problem by Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and propose efficient heuristic algorithms. For the impact of accommodation sequence on the algorithm performance, apart from the traditional sequence among different requests, we consider an additional sequence among the destinations of a multicast. For efficient multicast accommodation, we propose several strategies and compare their performances through a range of cases. To avoid a destination occupying excessive resources in certain cases of joining multiple light-trails, we propose an efficient algorithm to delete some duplicated destinations. Numerical results show that the proposed heuristic algorithms significantly outperform a benchmark algorithm and one performs close to the optimal MILP. Also, the algorithm for deleting certain destination replicas largely reduces the spectrum and transmitter usages, up to 41% and 20% for the cases considered, respectively.","['Multicast algorithms', 'Adaptive systems', 'Heuristic algorithms', 'Optical fiber networks', 'Benchmark testing', 'Multicast communication', 'Routing']","['Adaptive modulation', 'elastic optical network', 'light-trail', 'multicast', 'routing and spectrum assignment']"

Within the conventional Fabry-Pérot (FP) cavity, a high-Q bandpass filter formed by two tilted gratings with detuned Bragg wavelengths is embedded, and the resultant mode selection mechanism can purify the lasing spectrum by eliminating all but one of the FP cavity modes near the peak wavelength of the said filter. The proposed laser inherently bears the distinct feature of being robust against any small disturbances to oscillation loop. Simulation results from the large-signal dynamic model show that a stable single-mode operation has been achieved with a side-mode suppression ratio of as high as 50 dB.

"In dual-carrier (DC)-paired fiber optic long-reach transmission, which extends a point-to-multipoint coherent system to a cascaded reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexing (ROADM) system, a narrow passband causes severe performance degradation of the edge subcarriers. In this study, we proposed two-dimensional frequency and polarization domain coding and multicarrier-frequency control for cascaded ROADM filtering of robust multicarrier transmissions at a single wavelength. The proposed coding scheme reduced fiber nonlinearity, polarization-dependent loss (PDL), and passband narrowing (PBN) simultaneously. The multicarrier frequency control algorithm, which feeds back the received signal quality at multiple points, reduced PBN owing to long-term laser frequency drifts. With the proposed coding, the Q value of 56 Gbit/s × DC-paired dual-polarized (DP)-4QAM and 112 Gbit/s × DC-paired DP-16QAM signals improved by 1 dB and 0.2 dB, respectively, compared to that when no coding was used. Furthermore, the long-term frequency control emulated through the emulation model of laser frequency drifts and the performance degradation of average Q value were less than 0.4 dB and 0.1 dB, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, no other study has evaluated point-to-multipoint transmission over ROADM-induced optical filtering systems that apply frequency and polarization domain coding and multicarrier frequency control for DC-paired DP- M -QAM signals. The proposed methods enable stable operation while suppressing the effects of PDL and PBN, which are problems in multicarrier transmission, in long-reach optical fiber transmission systems that integrate access and metro networks.","['Optical filters', 'Optical fibers', 'Frequency control', 'Optical variables control', 'Optical polarization', 'Encoding', 'Transceivers']","['Optical communication', 'quadrature amplitude modulation', 'frequency division multiplexing', 'fiber nonlinearity', 'polarization-dependent loss', 'passband narrowing']"

"A cubic Stewart platform with an image sensor meausring is proposed for a line-of-sight (LOS) pointing and stabilization.

The experimental measurement shows that the photon recycling with the hemisphere reflector can increase the energy efficiency from 36.2% to 53.3% for on-axis incidence, and 35.2% to 55.7% for off-axis incidence. Besides, the efficiency keeps the same up to three-laser multiplexing in the experiment, and potentially can be extended to more than 10 in the simulation for various hole structures. The result is not only on the efficiency enhancement but also on the enhanced exitance of the laser white light and the unchanged etendue of the light source. This property is an important advantage for lasers rather than LEDs in a solid-state white light source.","['Phosphors', 'Photonics', 'Recycling', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Energy efficiency', 'Multiplexing', 'Wavelength measurement']","['Laser multiplexing', 'photon recycling', 'white light lighting', 'phosphor model']"

A compact erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) is demonstrated using a piece of 1.5-m-long erbium-doped fiber (EDF) with a microfiber coupled to a silica microsphere at the output end. A stable laser output is achieved due to the recirculation of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) light inside the linear cavity and the incorporation of microsphere which serves as both a laser filtering element and a mirror.

"For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, analytical expressions for mutually compensating the curved mirror astigmatism in the two terminal arms of a folded resonator are deduced and experimentally verified. The analytical expressions are derived using the theory of the propagation and transformation of Gaussian beams under few assumptions. Our exact analytical expressions describe the necessary and sufficient conditions for simultaneously compensating astigmatism in two arms of a sequence of two off-axis curved mirrors. The theoretical results indicate that, when the astigmatism compensation expressions are satisfied, the astigmatism introduced by a folded curved mirror can be mutually compensated by another folded curved mirror, even if there is no additional Brewster element inside the cavity. The astigmatism can only be successfully eliminated by using a pair of concave mirrors or convex mirrors. Our analytical expressions can be used to design astigmatically compensated folded resonators without a Brewster element. A typical side-pumped z-shaped cavity Nd:YAG laser is employed to demonstrate the astigmatic compensation. Experimental measurements of the pattern of the laser output beam show that not only the spot intensity profile deformation but, in addition, the phase distortion in the two terminal arms can be simultaneously compensated completely in the cavity, which is in good agreement with the analytical predictions.","['Lenses', 'Mirrors', 'Optical resonators', 'Laser beams', 'Laser noise', 'Laser cavity resonators']","['Solid-state lasers', 'Optical resonators', 'Laser cavity resonators', 'Astigmatism compensation', 'Phase compensation']"

"Fiber stretchers are used to stabilize the effective length of optical fiber links, but if they are not carefully calibrated, they can produce polarization changes and instabilities, which interact with the polarization mode dispersion (PMD) of the fiber link producing phase changes on the transmitted signals. Those can be minimized if the input polarization is aligned to one of the two orthogonal polarization states of the fiber stretcher, which show minimum polarization change across the dynamic range of the stretcher.

"On the basis of the photoelectric properties and hydrophilicity and multimode interference of Graphene Oxide (GO), this study proposes an all-fiber humidity sensor. Two core-offset regions are constructed with a fiber fusion splicer, and a GO film is coated on a single-mode fiber (SMF) between the core-offset regions to form a humidity-sensitive Mach–Zehnder interference structure. As the external humidity environment changes, the refractive index of the GO changes, and the light in the SMF is modulated by humidity. External humidity is measured by detecting the changes in the wavelength of the transmission spectrum of the sensing structure. A saturated salt solution is used to build a stable humidity environment. The sensitivity of the sensor is 0.05 nm/% relative humidity (RH) at 35.3%–95.8% RH, and the linear relationship between the characteristic wavelength and RH is 88%. In addition, the linear relationship between the light intensity and the RH of the sensor at a single wavelength at 1571 nm is analyzed, and the linearity is 97.45%. According to this finding, photoelectric conversion is used to convert the light intensity signal into a voltage signal. The data are processed by a computer to achieve the real-time and visual monitoring of the humidity environment.

"A simple schemefor generating chaotic signals with concealed time-delay signature (TDS) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The architecture of the system is based on a semiconductor laser (SL) under multi-path optical feedback (MPOF) provided by a 2 × 2 fiber coupler (FC) and a fiber mirror (FM). The results show that SLs with MPOF are more beneficial for achieving TDS suppressed chaotic output than those with single optical feedback (SOF) systems. In addition, the TDS of the chaotic signal generated by the SL under MPOF is insensitive to the length deviation of the feedback cavities, and therefore such a scheme is convenient for practical application. Furthermore, the influence of FC coupling ratio in the MPOF module, feedback strength, and bias current of the SL on the TDS is comprehensively studied. By selecting suitable parameters, the TDS of the chaotic signal generated by the SL under MPOF can be completely concealed. Finally, permutation entropy (PE) is adopted to evaluate the complexity of the generated chaotic signal, and the result demonstrates that the suppression of TDS does not lead to the degradation of complexity for the proposed scheme.","['Optical feedback', 'Chaotic communication', 'Optical attenuators', 'Couplings', 'Fiber optics', 'Optical coupling', 'Time series analysis']","['Chaos', 'multi-path optical feedback (MPOF)', 'semiconductor laser (SL)', 'time-delay signature (TDS)']"

"To overcome the inherent bandwidth limitation of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ultraviolet communication (UVC) channel, a novel space division multiplexing (SDM) framework based on non-coplanar rotation angle is established. The influence of SDM structure parameters on inter-channel interference (ICI) is studied to obtain the optimal antenna configuration. And a Gaussian approximate distribution (GAD) signal detection model is presented, which simplifies the calculation of the Bit error rate (BER) of the Photon multiplier tube (PMT) reception and is suitable for complex ICI analysis. Furthermore, a low ICI scheme based on the relationship between BER and the interference factor is proposed to increase the data transmission rate or reduce the alignment configuration. As a result, the maximum data rate increases to 34 Mbps, or the alignment demand decreases by 33.33% at most. Moreover, these analysis results and techniques can be applied to other NLOS scattering optical wireless communication systems.","['Signal detection', 'MIMO communication', 'Interference', 'Photonics', 'Receivers', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Scattering']","['Non-line-of-sight ultraviolet communication', 'spatial multiplexing', 'high data transfer rate']"

"We realize a high spatially resolved idler imaging with a compact noncollinear optical parametric amplifier, which is based on type-II phase matching (PM). Using an intense femtosecond laser pulse train as the pump, this amplifier can amplify a separate continuous-wave (CW) signal with high gain and broad gain bandwidth with no need for time synchronization between the pump and the signal. In spite of the noncollinear arrangement of the amplifier, the spatial geometric smearing (SGS) is eliminated inside the amplifier due to the collinear Poynting vectors of the signal and the idler, which promotes the horizontal spatial resolution of the idler image to approach its vertical spatial resolution. Our experiments show that this design can improve the 2-D space–bandwidth product (SBP) of the idler imaging by a factor of 2.8, compared with the noncollinear type-I PM amplifier.

"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are at the heart of several machine learning applications, while they suffer from computational complexity due to their large number of parameters and operations. Recently, all-optical implementation of the CNNs has achieved many attentions, however, the recently proposed optical architectures for CNNs cannot fully utilize the tremendous capabilities of optical processing, due to the required electro-optical conversions in-between successive layers. To implement an all-optical multi-layer CNN, it is essential to optically implement all required operations, namely convolution, summation of channels’ output for each convolutional kernel feeding the nonlinear unit, nonlinear activation function, and finally, pooling operations. Considering the lack of multi-layer photonic CNN implementation, in this paper, we explore a fully-optical design for implementing successive convolutional layers in an optical CNN. As a proof of concept, and without loss of generality, we considered two successive optical layers in the proposed network, named as 2L-OPCNN, for comparative studies against electrical counterpart and single optical layer CNN.

"We have fabricated highly luminescent samples with erbium-doped amorphous silicon suboxide $(a\hbox{-SiO}_{x} \langle \hbox{Er}\rangle)$ layers on $\hbox{SiO}_{2}/\hbox{Si}$ substrates. The layers are designed to provide a resonance with large modal overlap with the active material and with low quality factor (Q-factor) at 1540 nm. Also, the structure has higher Q-factor resonances in the wavelength range between 800 and 1000 nm. Within this range, strong light emission from $a\hbox{-SiO}_{x}$ defect-related radiative centers and emission from the $\hbox{Er}^{3+}\,{}^{4}{ \rm I}_{11/2} - ^{4}{\rm I}_{15/2}$ optical transition (980 nm) are observed.

"A radio frequency (RF)-assisted Sagnac interferometer based on a dual-loop optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) is experimentally demonstrated for high-precision magnetic field measurement, in which the tapered fiber covered with the magnetic fluid (MF) as the magnetic field sensing head is embedded in the Sagnac interferometer.

With only few cavity modes contained within the Brillouin gain curve, the dynamics of self-pulsing was not observed for the stimulated Brillouin scattering signal generated by each pump mode in the experiment. The results from two different experimental schemes show that both the Brillouin and ytterbium gains are required to support enough Brillouin pump and stokes cavity modes for partial mode locking. We also show that it is the coupling between the stimulated Brillouin scattering of the neighboring Brillouin pump modes that plays a direct role in the partial phase synchronization between different stokes modes. Furthermore, we proposed a theoretical model about the partially mode-locked laser dynamics. Based on the model, the numerical results agree quantitatively with the experimental ones.

"Visible light communication (VLC) has emerged as an eco-friendly and low-cost technology for the next-generation communication systems. However, for VLC systems, existing works report performance degradation due to light-emitting-diode (LED) non-linearity, multipath and relative mobility between the transmitter and the receiver. Additionally, multipath and user-mobility introduce inter-symbol-interference (ISI) and frequency-domain spreading which degrades the performance of VLC systems. For such scenarios, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is well-known to jointly addresses impairments due to multipath and user-mobility. To mitigate the distortions due to LED non-linearity, recently reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)-based random Fourier feature (RFF) techniques have emerged which alleviate the dependence on learning a dictionary and, outperforms classical polynomial based techniques. However, performance of these techniques is sensitive to the choice of kernel-width. Thus, for the OTFS systems impaired by LED non-linearity, this manuscript proposes a hyperparameter-free RFF-based post-distorter, under finite-memory budget without the need of explicitly tuning kernel-width for best performance. Analytical bounds for the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the proposed post-distorter are presented, and validated via simulations over realistic VLC channels. From the results it is verified that the proposed receiver achieves better BER performance over uncompensated scenario and classical baseline polynomial based technique.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Symbols', 'Transforms', 'Receivers', 'Time-frequency analysis', 'Time-domain analysis', 'Modulation']","['Visible light communication (VLC)', 'orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)', 'random Fourier feature (RFF)', 'bit error rate (BER)']"

"Plasmonic interferometric imaging has been widely used for fast and label-free detection to nano-objects, which associates the interference between launched and scattered surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). As scattering of SPPs is affected by the characteristics of nano-objects, particle size, particle index and particle-interface distances have been retrieved from the imaging. Refractive index of dielectric, which tailors the resonant wavelength of launched SPPs, is also a key issue to plasmonic interferometric imaging. Yet, the influence of refractive index to plasmonic interferometric imaging has not been investigated. In this work, we connected the dielectric refractive index to the interferometric image intensity distribution, and found that both fringe periodicities and intensity profiles along SPP wavefronts were tailored by the refractive index, which is illustrated by using glucose solutions with different concentrations. Our research illustrates the pattern change of plasmonic interferometric imaging induced by dielectric refractive index, which not only paves the way for the basic understanding on the plasmonic interferometric imaging, but also provides a new potential visual method for real-time refractive index sensing and monitoring, which will be applied to food safety and environment monitoring.","['Plasmons', 'Imaging', 'Refractive index', 'Interference', 'Nanoparticles', 'Gold', 'Glucose']","['Plasmonic', 'surface plasmon polaritons', 'interferometric imaging', 'refractive index']"

"Electroabsorption modulated lasers (EMLs) is sensitive to the residual facet reflection (RFR), which can cause a low-frequency drop (LFD) in the modulation response. The LFD may result in output waveform distortion, especially for high-data rate and multi-level modulation. We verify by simulation and experiments that the effect of LFD on the EML performance and propose to use LFD as one of the key performance indices for qualifying EMLs in high-speed optical transceivers. LFD can be suppressed by incorporating partial-corrugated-grating (PCG) in the laser section.

This provides the robustness in applying the PCG-DFB to achieve a flat intensity modulation response or to enhance the output waveform under large signal modulation. By designing the PCG-EML to have about 60% of grating region, it can reach >80% of SMY and improve the average Q-value from the reduced LFD in the modulation response. The PCG-EML with reduced LFD can enhance the eye-opening through reduced waveform undershoot and overshoot for transmitting 56-Gbaud/s or beyond PAM-4 signals.","['Laser feedback', 'Mathematical models', 'Laser modes', 'Modulation', 'Optical feedback', 'Lasers', 'Gratings']","['Electroabsorption', 'low-frequency drop', 'optical communication', 'partial grating', 'residual facet reflection']"

"We thoughtfully investigate the feasibility of reducing the mode-coupling caused crosstalk by optimizing the practical parameters of the few-mode fiber (FMF), based on the linear coupling theory. According to our simulation results, the low crosstalk FMF could be achieved with the small fiber core, the low refractive-index (RI) related parameters, the long operating-wavelength and the low core-eccentricity (CE). Moreover, the transmission behaviors over the fixed coupling and the random coupling scenarios are also discussed. The power distribution and the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) evolutions along FMF reveal the impacts from the mode-coupling induced crosstalk in the spatial division multiplexing (SDM) transmission system. The random nature of the mode coupling suggesting the turbulent results are obtained in our simulation, confirmed the observation in the SDM test.

"Cooperative quantum cutting mechanism in a spectral converter of Tm 3+ /Yb 3+ -codoped tellurite glass is investigated by setting up and solving the theoretical model of rate equations and power propagation equations in MATLAB.

"The modulation response of monolithically integrated external optical injection-locking (EOIL) semiconductor ring lasers based on photon-photon resonance effect was systematically analyzed. The simulation results show that the modulation response of the EOIL laser is strongly dependent on the internal loss of the ring laser. Assuming that the waveguide was loss-free, the modulation bandwidth of as high as 67.5 GHz was predicted. However, due to the excessive loss associated with the bending waveguide of the circular-shaped ring laser, the modulation performance of such EOIL laser has no any advantage over its free-running counterpart. Instead, use of rectangular-shaped ring laser as the slave laser is proposed to circumvent the issue associated with the excessive waveguide loss, since the internal loss, in this case, is only dependent on the reflectivity of the total reflection mirrors. Simulation shows the modulation bandwidth of at least 38 GHz is achievable in such EOIL laser, provided the reflectivity of the total reflection mirrors is greater than 96%. It is believed that this theoretical study will facilitate the future experimental demonstration of the monolithically integrated EOIL lasers.","['Ring lasers', 'Semiconductor lasers', 'Laser modes', 'Waveguide lasers', 'Modulation', 'Laser theory', 'Nanoscale devices']","['Direct modulation lasers', 'external optical injection-locking', 'monolithically integrated', 'photon-photon resonance', 'ring lasers']"

"Structure and design were proposed for a kind of novel multifunctional M × N microring array side-coupled Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) electrooptic switch/ filter.

"Multihop relaying is a potential technique to mitigate channel impairments in optical wireless communications (OWC). In this paper, multiple fixed-gain amplify-and-forward (AF) relays are employed to enhance the OWC performance under the combined effect of atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, and fog. We consider a long-range OWC link by modeling the atmospheric turbulence by the Fisher-Snedecor {\mathcal {F}} distribution, pointing errors by the generalized non-zero boresight model, and random path loss due to fog. We also consider a short-range OWC system by ignoring the impact of atmospheric turbulence. We derive novel upper bounds on the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both short and long-range multihop OWC systems by developing exact statistical results for a single-hop OWC system under the combined effect of {\mathcal {F}} -turbulence channels, non-zero boresight pointing errors, and fog-induced fading. Based on these expressions, we present analytical expressions of outage probability (OP) and average bit-error-rate (ABER) performance for the considered OWC systems involving single-variate Fox's H and Meijer's G functions. Moreover, asymptotic expressions of the outage probability in high SNR region are developed using simpler Gamma functions to provide insights on the effect of channel and system parameters. The derived analytical expressions are validated through Monte-Carlo simulations, and the scaling of the OWC performance with the number of relay nodes is demonstrated with a comparison to the single-hop transmission.","['Atmospheric modeling', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Fading channels', 'Relays', 'Probability density function', 'Spread spectrum communication', 'Adaptive optics']","['Fisher-Snedecor ${\\mathcal {F}}$ distribution', 'foggy channel', 'multihop', 'non-zero boresight pointing errors', 'optical wireless communication']"

"Visible light communications (VLC) techniques are viewed as promising candidates for the upcoming B5G&6G mobile wireless networks. Due to the broadcast nature of VLC channel, physical layer security (PLS) techniques have been considered and explored to improve the confidentiality of VLC transmission. Nevertheless, almost all current designs focus on application scenarios including sufficient transmitters and fail to match the scenarios with limited, even just two transmitters. For addressing this challenge, in this article, multiple optical beam switching scheme is proposed. Unlike conventional Lambertian beam based technique paradigm, the given scheme tentatively utilize two asymmetry non-Lambertian beams to configure each VLC transmitter. Numerical results show that, for the typical center legitimate receiver, compared with about 0.92 bps/Hz average secrecy capacity (SC) of the conventional Lambertian beam configuration, up to 5.55 bps/Hz average SC gain is acquired through the proposed beam switching scheme. Moreover, this potential gain will be enhanced to about 5.86 bps/Hz when three candidate non-Lambertian beams are available for each transmitter.","['Optical beams', 'Optical transmitters', 'Optical switches', 'Visible light communication', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Optical receivers', 'Three-dimensional displays']","['Multiple optical beam switching', 'physical layer security', 'secrecy capacity', 'visible light communications']"
"Bound state in the continuum (BIC), as a novel eigenmode with infinitely high-quality factor, has received great attention in modern optical science. Mode coupling in dielectric metasurfaces opens possibilities in searching for robust BICs. Here, we discover multiple BICs in periodic dielectric resonators composed of a silicon rectangular bar and a silicon ring in one lattice. For the symmetry-protected BIC at-Γ point, a sharp electromagnetically induced transparency window can be formed by either tilting incident angle to induce the ‘bright-bright’ mode coupling, or by displacing the ring to generate the ‘bright-dark’ mode coupling. Besides, the coupling between two resonators leads to a new energy band in the dielectric metasurface. As a result, two off-Γ BICs are formed owing to avoided crossings with two energy bands, and another one belongs to the single-resonance parametric BIC. Thus, our coupled resonators possess superior abilities to judiciously engineer BICs via versatile physical mechanisms. Taking advantage exclusively of coupled resonators in dielectric metasurfaces provides fresh insights into the creation of both symmetry-protected and accidental BICs, which enables profound advancements in designing novel photonic devices.","['Resonators', 'Metasurfaces', 'Dielectrics', 'Couplings', 'Bars', 'Silicon', 'Q-factor']","['Bound states in the continuum', 'electromagnetically induced transparency', 'metasurface', 'Q-factor']"

Split meander lines, plus spiral rings, are carefully adjusted to accommodate complex equivalent currents for generating the required transmitted phase.

"Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a promising technology to provide high throughput and overall improved system performance at affordable cost for next-generation passive optical networks (NG-PONs). Message passing algorithm (MPA) based on a factor graph is usually used for low-complexity multi-user detection in SCMA. However, MPA requires accurate and effective channel estimation due to the interference between the user's signals on the same resource block and suffers uncertain convergence caused by the cycles in the factor graph.

"Modern computing and data storage systems increasingly rely on parallel architectures. The necessity for high-bandwidth data links has made optical communication a critical constituent of modern information systems and silicon the leading platform for creating the necessary optical components. While silicon is arguably the most extensively studied material in history, one of its most important attributes, i.e., an analysis of its capacity to carry optical information, has not been reported. The calculation of the information capacity of silicon is complicated by nonlinear losses, which are phenomena that emerge in optical nanowires as a result of the concentration of optical power in a small geometry. While nonlinear loss in silicon is well known, noise and fluctuations that arise from it have never been considered. Here, we report fluctuations that arise from two-photon absorption, plasma effect, cross-phase modulation, and four-wave mixing and investigate their role in limiting the information capacity of silicon. We show that these fluctuations become significant and limit the capacity well before nonlinear processes affect optical transmission.

To investigate the properties of NAbLM in contrast with typical nonlinear optical loop mirror (NOLM), an asymmetric optical coupler is used in the NAbLM. In experiment, both the NAbLM and NOLM can be used to mode-lock a Yb-doped fiber (YDF) laser and enable a type of noise-like pulse (NLP) generation. Noticeably, however, it is further found that, in comparison to NOLM, NAbLM evidently enables both temporal and radio frequency (RF) noise suppressions, as well as elimination of RF variations. Further calculations show that the saturable property of the incorporated absorber plays a vital role in differing the NAbLM from typical NOLM.

"We report an abnormal waveguiding phenomenon that the fundamental mode guided in strip waveguides of a special Ti-diffused LiNbO 3 waveguide structure, in which an array of 4and 6-μm-wide strip waveguides is embedded in a planar waveguide, nonperiodically oscillates with the wavelength along the waveguide width direction.

The phenomenon is abnormal as it displays the features of multimode interference (MMI), but the single-mode pattern was captured from the strip waveguide at the 1.5-μm wavelength. Further numerical analysis for the waveguiding characteristics shows that the strip waveguide also supports a nearly cutoff higher order mode, in addition to the fundamental mode, allowing to explain the abnormal phenomenon: the MMI may take place in some regions of the strip waveguide and the observed singlemode pattern is because the higher order mode, which takes part in the MMI, is close to the cutoff.","['Planar waveguides', 'Strips', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Loss measurement', 'Oscillators', 'Wavelength measurement']","['Ti:$\\hbox{LiNbO}_{3}$ (LN) waveguide', 'abnormal waveguiding characteristic', 'multimode interference (MMI)']"

"Pure Q-switching (self-pulsating) behaviour is shown for the first time in an optically injected two-section quantum-dot laser. Upon CW optical injection, it was possible to switch the operation regime from free-running mode-locking to locked Q-switching. Under this regime, the pulse repetition rate of around 1 GHz was tunable with injection power (by more than 100 MHz) and absorber reverse bias. Moreover, through injection-locking, the Q-switched output was spectrally tunable by around 7 nm, by tuning the master laser. The seamless switch between mode-locking and Q-switching with optical injection as well as the tunability and control afforded by injection-locking could open up a range of applications, such as in multi-modal imaging. On a more fundamental level, this investigation has also generated new insights into the dynamics of quantum-dot lasers and the optical injection process.","['Semiconductor lasers', 'Laser mode locking', 'Optical pulses', 'Optical switches', 'Laser tuning', 'Optical fibers', 'Stimulated emission']","['Laser mode locking', 'laser tuning', 'optical tuning', 'quantum dot lasers', 'semiconductor lasers', 'ultrafast optics']"

"The security and reliability of free space optical (FSO) communications and the trade-off between the two are the most critical characteristics to emphasize in FSO systems, especially as optical wireless communications continue to evolve. In this work, we investigate the impact of opportunistic transmit aperture selection (TAS) on the security-reliability trade-off (SRT) of the multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) free space optical system. We consider a general scenario in which the FSO system consists of a transmitter side with K users and a single receiver with N apertures communicating over generalized Malaga-M turbulence channels. We derive the TAS combined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distributions for the FSO MIMO channel between the transmitting users and the receiver. A statistical analysis of the TAS scheme is performed, where the k th best user with the highest SNR is selected. Based on this analysis, the closed-form expressions for the outage probability, average bit error rate, intercept probability, and SRT are derived. Then, the diversity advantages provided by the channel variations considering the atmospheric turbulence and generalized nonzero boresight pointing errors are further discussed. The results show that the considered TAS significantly improves the security, reliability, and SRT performance and has the potential to solve existing FSO communication problems. Monte Carlo simulations are used to verify the correctness of the numerical results.","['Laser beams', 'Security', 'Reliability', 'Apertures', 'Adaptive optics', 'Optical receivers', 'Atmospheric modeling']","['Free space optical', 'security', 'reliability', 'security-reliability trade-off', 'opportunistic scheduling selection', 'transmit aperture selection', 'atmospheric turbulence', 'nonzero boresight pointing errors', 'multiple-input–multiple-output']"

"The optical interaction mechanism of a nanohole pair milled in an opaque gold film by means of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) propagation is investigated. This interaction depends on the polarization direction of the incident light and the separation distance between the nanoholes. It is found that when the nanoholes are illuminated by a plane wave incident light polarized parallel to the axis of the nanohole pair, the SPP waves can propagate between the nanoholes, and therefore, the nanoholes can interact through SPPs. In contrast, it is shown that for the incident plane wave polarized perpendicular to the pair axis, the propagation direction of the SPPs is normal to the pair axis, and thus, a weak interaction through the SPPs can occur between the nanoholes. It is also shown that in order to investigate the interaction of the nanoholes through the SPP waves, each nanohole can be modeled by a magnetic dipole, which propagates SPPs. Thus, the optical properties of the interacting nanoholes can be modeled using a magnetic-coupled dipole approximation method accounting SPPs to confirm the simulation results.","['Optical polarization', 'Optical films', 'Optical surface waves', 'Magnetic separation', 'Gold']","['Subwavelength structures', 'plasmonics', 'surface', 'nanostructures']"

"Nonlinear frequency division multiplexing (NFDM) system is an optional candidate to overcome the fiber nonlinearity limit. A full-spectrum modulated NFDM system, modulating data on combined continuous spectrum (CS) and discrete spectrum (DS) together, was proposed in recent years to improve the data rates and spectral efficiency (SE) by exploiting all the degrees of freedom offered in the nonlinear spectrum. However, the selection of discrete eigenvalues greatly affects the performance of both CS and DS. Designing appropriate eigenvalues of DS is an important issue to ensure the high SE and excellent performance of the system. In this paper, we discussed the selcection principle of eigenvalues and analyzed it from multiple perspectives, 11 eigenvalues with 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (64QAM) are selected for DS. Besides optimizing the eigenvalues at the transmitter, the linear minimum mean-square estimate (LMMSE) method was used at the receiver to furtherly improve the performance of DS. Through the numerical simulation, a 113 Gb/s (SE of 2.8 bits/s/Hz) full-spectrum modulated NFDM system was set up and transmitted 1120 km distance, where the Q-factors of both CS and DS are above the hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) threshold.

"H0-type photonic crystal nanocavities hold high quality factors Q and quite small cavity mode volumes. This study finds their ultrahigh Q structures, which allow stable operation as a nanolaser even with fabrication-induced disordering. Previously, we generated a neural network model for predicting Q s, searched for a high- Q structure and its slotted version, and found those showing Q = 1,140,000 and 91,600, respectively. These values were an order of magnitude higher than those obtained by manual optimizations. However, further improvement above these values was saturated because of the insufficient accuracy of the neural network model at the high Q regime. Instead of applying the model, we repeated directly calculating Q s, implementing a covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy algorithm to search structures in this study. Consequently, Q values were increased up to 14,500,000 and 741,000 while consuming shorter calculation time. We also confirmed that these structures significantly improve robustness against structural disordering.","['Optimization', 'Predictive models', 'Finite difference methods', 'Time-domain analysis', 'Data models', 'Artificial neural networks', 'Slabs']","['Photonic crystal', 'nanolaaser', 'evolutionary calculation', 'machine learning']"

"Synchronization is a long-standing challenge in modern large-scale distributed systems, and newly deployed systems such as 5G and modern netted radars require more extensive synchronization. As the number of distributed stations increasing, new synchronization solution with much effort on extensibility is highly expected. In this paper we first analyze the requirements on extensibility of fiber-based sync systems, and then propose a phase-stabilized side-branch radio-over-fiber (RoF) link, which fully satisfies the extensibility requirements. The extensible side-branch link can be constructed at any intermediate point along the main link, without any reconfiguration at the central station, which is especially feasible when adding extra stations in system capacity expansion. The main link phase shift is first stabilized by tuning the optical carrier wavelength, while another phase-locked-loop constructed at the starting point of the branch link stabilizes the phase shift from the central station to the end of branch link, by phase locking two phase-varying signals. Moreover, the phase-stable side branch is inherently extensible to multiple frequency signals, which can be used in receivers requiring multiple local oscillators (LOs). Two frequency signals are simultaneously disseminated to the end of branch link in the experiment, with frequency stability optimization of two orders of magnitude on both LOs achieved. The proposed stable side-branch RoF link shows the potential of constructing a highly-extensible frequency dissemination network for the synchronization in modern distributed systems.","['Synchronization', 'Optical filters', 'Optical feedback', 'Optical reflection', 'Frequency synchronization', 'Optical modulation', 'Optical fiber dispersion']","['Frequency synchronization', 'extensible side-branch', 'distributed systems', 'radio-over-fiber']"
"Sub-wavelength metal grating structures exhibit extraordinary transmission (EOT) due to constructive interference of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) tunneling.

"Photonics-assisted microwave instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM) is considered as a promising technique for detecting an unknown radio-frequency (RF) signal, which has advantages of broad frequency measurement range and fast processing speed. Up to date, there is no photonics-assisted IFM system that can essentially measure an unknown RF signal time-frequency information with power fluctuating seriously. Moreover, the measurement accuracy and frequency modulation recognition are not as good as those of traditional electronic methods. Here, we propose an IFM scheme based on the combination of Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) and Brillouin loss spectrum (BLS), which is RF-power-independent with high measurement efficiency. The combination of BGS and BLS to construct the amplitude comparison function (ACF) can reduce the influence of RF signal power fluctuation within 21.27 dB by single-shot measuring. When an appropriate frequency interval with frequency domain monotonous power of microwave comb signal is modulated on the pump lightwave, the IFM accuracy of the unknown signal reaches about 1 MHz. After the initial calibration of the system, it can recognize the time-frequency variation of single tone signal, linear frequency modulated signal (LFM), nonlinear frequency modulated signal (NLFM), and Costas signal. This scheme will help to promote the application of the IFM in the field of spectrum reconnaissance and reception.","['Frequency measurement', 'Scattering', 'Time-frequency analysis', 'Frequency modulation', 'Gain', 'Loss measurement', 'Optical fiber amplifiers']","['Instantaneous frequency measurement', 'Brillouin gain and loss spectrum', 'power-independent', 'Costas signal']"

"A reflective optical encoder has been proposed and realized capitalizing on a miniaturized sensing head, which integrates both a pair of index gratings and a beam router in a plastic smart frame. The index gratings play a role in selectively transmitting the incident beam carrying the periodic grating pattern of a code scale. The beam router, consisting of a collimating lens in conjunction with a prism, is used to collimate and steer the beam originating from a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) toward the code scale. The proposed encoder is rigorously designed by ray optic simulations and manufactured by passively aligning a smart frame, which is produced by plastic injection molding, with a VCSEL at λ = 850 nm and two semicircular photodetectors. The index grating is created by forming an Al grating pattern of a 10- μm pitch on a silica substrate. Two output signals provide sinusoidal signals, which are 90 ° out of phase from each other. The period of the signals is 4 μs at a frequency of 250 kHz, which is equivalent to a period of 10 μm. As expected, the relative phase relationship is reversed by altering the direction of rotation of the code scale. By examining either of the two output signals, we can simply demonstrate positional and angular resolutions of about 10 μm and 0.04 °, respectively.

With parameters optimized, high transmittance up to 85% with full-width-at-half-maximum bandwidth of 64% near 1.9 μm can be realized for TM-polarized light. Moreover, the BT can be maintained in a large range of oblique incident angles from 0° to 30°. In another word, the BT is capable of not only collimated beams but also noncollimated incident lights. Moreover, the high-transmission window can be tuned in the IR spectrum region by modulating the metallic gratings' thicknesses.","['Dielectrics', 'Gratings', 'Broadband communication', 'Optical polarization', 'Magnetic fields', 'Integrated circuit modeling', 'Silver']","['Broadband transmission', 'transparent conductor', 'broadband optical polarizer']"

"Chaotic optical communication based on conventional external cavity semiconductor laser is a very promising solution for physical layer secure communication. However, the intrinsic time delay signature (TDS) associated with the external cavity length and the potential direct linear filtering (DLF) or synchronization utilization attack greatly threaten the system security. In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate a novel scheme for TDS suppression and security enhancement of chaotic optical communication based on external temporal self-feedback hardware encryption and decryption. In this scheme, the confidential chaotic modulated signal is temporally scrambled in the time domain by two optical dispersion components and an electro-optic self-feedback phase modulation loop between them, which simultaneously conceal the TDS and enhance the security against malicious attacks. Proof-of-principle demonstration for a security enhanced chaotic optical communication system with error free transmission is successfully achieved. The proposed scheme may provide a promising way for pure-hardware based physical secure chaotic optical communication systems.","['Chaotic communication', 'Optical fibers', 'Fiber optics', 'Optical feedback', 'Optical transmitters', 'Dispersion', 'Optical fiber communication']","['Optical communications', 'optical encryption', 'chaos', 'semiconductor lasers']"
"A resonant-ring-assisted large mode area segmented cladding fiber (RR-SCF) with a high-index ring in the core is proposed. Numerical investigations of the effects of the high-index ring on the leakage losses of guiding modes, mode area, and electric field distribution of FM of the proposed fiber show the high-index ring not only increases the ratio of the loss between the fundamental mode (FM) and the higher-order modes (HOMs) but also improves the electric field distribution of the FM to be flat. By taking these advantages of the high-index-ring-assisted core, the effective single-mode (SM) operation is achieved in the proposed fiber bent in any orientation, which makes up the defect of the conventional RR-SCF that the SM output is affected by the bending orientation. Meanwhile, the mode area is enlarged. Furthermore, the effects of the heat load, duty cycle, bending, and operation wavelength on the fiber performance are analyzed. The results show single-mode operation in all bending orientations with a mode area larger than 824 μm 2 can be achieved at a tight bending radius of 15 cm to 16 cm when the operating wavelength ranges from 1.06 μm to 1.76 μm.

"A novel scheme of self-oscillation multicarrier light source based on recirculating frequency shift loop (RFSL) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated in this paper. Compared with conventional RFSL-based multicarrier generation schemes, the radio frequency (RF) signal for driving the modulator in RFSL is generated by an internal self-oscillation of the optical carrier instead of the external commercial RF source device. The self-oscillation method significantly reduces the cost of the light source and decreases the phase noise of RF signal and multicarrier signal. In the experiment, we successfully generate a single-mode oscillation RF signal with the phase noise of −85.10 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset frequency. A total of 49 multicarrier optical signals from 1550.59 nm to 1554.44 nm with the power fluctuation as low as 3 dB are obtained.

"As a special imaging technique, one of the most important advantages of single-pixel imaging (SPI) than conventional imaging method is that it can recover the object image even through turbid medium. In these situations, the noises bring by the turbid medium usually obey special rules in statistics. While in some other applications, SPI is performed in the environment with complicate ambient light, in which no prior information of the environment noise is known. Aiming at this situation, in this work, the frame-by-frame subtraction-based compressive sensing SPI (FFS-CSPI) method with random 0/1 pattern is used to decrease the effect from the unknown ambient light. The noise robustness of the FFS-CSPI method is analyzed and compared with Hadamard CSPI. In simulation and experiment, two kinds of noises, from external light source and from background video, are considered. The results prove that FFS-CSPI with random 0/1 patterns can achieve higher image quality than conventional mean subtraction method and Hadamard CSPI with the same measurement number. Considering the high refresh rate of digital micromirror device when it loads the 0/1 binary patterns, the imaging speed is acceptable.

"A silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) contains an array of microcells that can each detect individual photons. Consequently, it can arguably result in the most sensitive receiver in visible light communication (VLC). However, each microcell needs a period of several nanoseconds to recover after detecting a photon. This creates a non-linear response and introduces a unique form of inter-symbol interference. In this paper, we first show that this interference splits each element of the received signal constellation into multiple clusters. This observation motivates the investigation into the use of a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) to deal with the impact of the nonlinearity. Both the training procedures and the performance of the RBFNN are explained and discussed in detail. The influence of the number of the RBFNN centers, the widths of the centers, the constellation size and the period of the transmitted signal samples on the system performance are investigated. In addition, two different RBFNN-based data demodulation methods are introduced. The simulation results suggest that the new RBFNN-aided receivers reduce the negative impacts of the SiPM nonlinearity and can result in lower bit error rates (BERs) for a wide range of irradiances on the SiPM.","['Photonics', 'Microcell networks', 'Single-photon avalanche diodes', 'Optical distortion', 'Interference', 'Optical sensors', 'OFDM']","['SiPM', 'SPAD', 'photon-counting', 'nonlinearity', 'machine learning', 'radial basis function neural network']"

"The temperature droop characteristics of internal efficiency (IE) in InGaN/GaN quantum well (QW) structures were investigated using the multiband effective mass theory. In the case of a relatively small Auger recombination (<; C A = 5 × 10 -30 cm 6 s), the QW structure with a smaller In composition (x = 0.1) shows a larger hot/cold factor (IE T1 /IE T2 , with T 1 > T 2 ) than that with a larger In composition (x = 0.3) because the radiative recombination is dominant and the IE of the former is much larger than that of the latter. The hot/cold factors for QW structures with x = 0.1 and 0.3 are 0.85 and 0.71 at J = 100 A/cm 2 , respectively. On the other hand, in the case of a relatively large Auger recombination (> C A = 10 -28 cm 6 s), the hot/cold factor (0.69) of the QW structure with a larger In composition is found to be larger than that (0.62) with a smaller In composition. This is attributed to the fact that the Auger recombination is dominant even for the QW structure with a small In composition and that the difference of the IE between two different temperatures decreases with increasing x.","['Temperature', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Gallium nitride', 'Charge carrier density', 'Stimulated emission', 'Radiative recombination']","['Temperature droop', 'quantum well', 'light-emitting diode', 'GaN', 'InGaN']"

"In this paper, we report a new method to generate tunable high-repetition-rate temporal cavity solitons (TCSs) in a nonlinear fiber cavity, which is driven by dual Brillouin laser pulses. This method is more feasible than generating solitons via a continuous optical-driven nonlinear cavity because of the enhanced four-wave mixing process triggered by the high peak intensity Brillouin laser pulses. The generated TCSs lock to the beating signal arriving from dual Brillouin pulses, which allows the repetition rate of the solitons to be directly tuned all- optically. The TCSs can be continuously tuned over a repetition rate range of 140∼242 GHz by controlling the external dual-wavelength spacing, and the pulse duration can be accordingly adjusted from 0.9 ps to 513 fs. Such TCSs with tunable high-repetition-rate can provide a practical solution for the low-noise controllable millimeter-wave and terahertz sources.","['Pump lasers', 'Scattering', 'Optical pumping', 'Optical pulses', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical solitons', 'Fiber nonlinear optics']","['Dual pulse Brillouin laser', 'Kerr frequency comb', 'temporal cavity solitons', 'tuning mode spacing']"
"In this paper, we comparatively studied the energy band diagram and the cutoff wavelength characteristics of germanium-tin (GeSn) fin and pillar array detectors wrapped in a Si 3 N 4 liner stressor to unveil the impacts of tensile strain and device architecture in the absorption spectra of the devices. A large tensile strain is introduced into GeSn devices by the expansion of the Si 3 N 4 liner stressor. Compared to the fin detector, a larger tensile volume strain is demonstrated in the GeSn pillar architecture. With the tensile strain induced by the Si 3 N 4 liner stressor, the direct bandgap E G,Γ of GeSn is obviously shrinked by lowering the energy of the Γ conduction band valley, which results in a significant extension of absorption edge in the GeSn detectors. As the Si 3 N 4 liner stressor releases internal stress and expands, the absorption edge of the tensile-strained Ge 0.90 Sn 0.10 pillar array detector with the length of side of pillar L pillar of 100 nm is extended to 4.35 μm. With further improvement, the tensile-strained GeSn pillar architecture with the Si 3 N 4 liner stressor will be competitive for the application in 2-5-μm mid-infrared spectra.","['Detectors', 'Tin', 'Arrays', 'Photonic band gap', 'Tensile strain', 'Absorption']","['Germanium-tin', 'Detectors', 'Mid-infrared', 'Tensile strain', 'Liner stressor']"

"Modern-day diamond sorting is achieved through the application of X-ray luminescence (XRL) and X-ray transmission (XRT) techniques. Sorting with XRL is limited to the class range of 1.25 mm to 32 mm because of self-absorption associated with larger diamonds, greater than 32mm. The effect of self-absorption is also a high-energy phenomenon in XRL. XRT is limited to sorting large size diamonds as the technique suffers poor contrast for diamonds smaller than 10mm. XRT measurements are immune to self-absorption for all sample sizes, while XRL measurements have good contrast for particles smaller than 32mm. The applications of these techniques have hitherto been used independently of each other and have subsequently progressed mutually exclusively. Here we analytically show a new paradox of a dual-modality X-ray diamond sorting combining XRL and XRT techniques' strengths. Key features of our new paradoxical model performance are contrast mitigation for small particles and self-absorption rejection for a large particle at high energy as well as improved particle detectability and classification.","['Sorting', 'Diamond', 'Absorption', 'Detectors', 'Fluorescence', 'Licenses', 'Mathematical model']","['Luminescence', 'fluorescence', 'transmission', 'self-absorption', 'contrast', 'detectability']"

"In this article, energy efficient asymmetrically clipped frequency-shift keying (AC-FSK) based visible light communication (VLC) system is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. In order to facilitate straightforward comparison with the experimental results, theoretical expression for bit error probability, based on the Euclidean distance analysis of AC-FSK symbols, is provided. The VLC setup is based on commercial off-the-shelf components and software defined radio. The bit error rate (BER) performance of AC-FSK is evaluated considering maximum likelihood (ML) receiver, 1-tap discrete cosine transform (DCT) based receiver and frequency-domain harmonic receiver. Simulation and experimental results reveal that the performance of harmonic and ML receivers is almost identical. On the other hand, considering harmonic receiver for both AC-FSK and state-of-the-art unipolar (U)-FSK, we also gather that the BER performance of both schemes is almost the same. However, the harmonic receiver complexity of AC-FSK is 41.6% and 33.3% less compared to that of U-FSK for modulation order M = 16 and M = 128 , respectively.

"Nanowire photonic crystal (PhC) structure is one of promising approaches to enhance vertical light extraction efficiency (LEE) of ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV LEDs). There are lots of investigations to study the structure of nanowire UV LEDs by using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The optimal LEE are obtained by using some optimization algorithms. However, it needs a broad window, not the best values of geometrical parameters of nanowires in practical fabrication. In this paper, the vertical LEE of UV LEDs are theoretically enhanced by selecting the band gaps of AlGaN-based nanowire PhC structure. It illustrates that all the gaps can inhibit the horizontal propagation of light. However, the inhibiting ability of Gap 1 are weaker than them of Gap 2 and Gap 3. The reason is that the radii of nanowires in Gap 1 are too small to support enough guided modes. As a comparison, both Gap 2 and Gap 3 can efficiently inhibit the radiated mode propagation, and finally enhance the vertical LEE. In addition, the variations of height, number, and refractive index of nanowires on vertical LEE and optical band gaps are discussed.

Under a real experimental condition where the incident power is 75 mW, the source-detector distance is 1.0 cm, and the full width at half maxima of the IRF is 160 ps, we used simulation experiments to investigate the relationship between the contrast of the intensity autocorrelation function (g 2 ) in two brain functional states (i.e., baseline and activation) and TD-DCS system parameters (including L C , IRF, source-detector distance, gate opening time and gate width).Our simulation results show that both longer L C and longer integration time are beneficial to a more sensitive detection. With a fixed L C and integration time, the optimal parameters of gate opening time is 800 ps (relative to the peak time of IRF), and gate width is equal to or larger than 800 ps.

"A wavelength division (de)multiplexing (WDM) filter with ultra-low channel crosstalk (XT) and high tolerance was proposed for a 1 × 4 O-band coarse-WDM (CWDM) system on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI). The filter consists of four waveguide Bragg grating (WBG) structures, each one having a multi-mode waveguide and corrugations at both waveguide side walls. To relax the critical dimension, low-material-index silicon nitride (SiN _{x} ) was utilized instead of silicon. For efficient design of each SiN _{x} multi-mode WBG (MMWBG), the core and corrugation widths were engineered over the perturbed-permittivity coupled-mode theory, leading to an ultra-high side-lobe suppression ratio > 25.3 dB. The overall CWDM filter offers flat-top responses with ultra-low excess losses (ELs) < 0.6 dB, a high channel uniformity >- 0.45 dB, broad 1-dB bandwidths (BWs) \sim 13.45 nm, ultra-low XTs < - 28 dB, and ultra-broad available bandwidths of 14.35 nm for XTs < - 28 dB (ABW _{28-} dB \sim 14.35 nm).

It is believed that these innovative observations would have potential applications in the ultra-compact on-chip mode division multiplexing (MDM) systems, and provide inspirations for the development of multimode photonics.","['Silicon', 'Absorption', 'Gold', 'Filtering theory', 'Plasmons', 'Optical waveguides', 'Optical fiber filters']","['Mode hybridization', 'mode division multiplexing', 'multimode photonics']"

"Reflective Fourier ptychographic microscopy has much potential for industrial surface inspection due to the ability to overcome the physical limits of the numerical aperture of the optical microscopy. However, the time cost for misalignment calibration and Fourier ptychography (FP) recovery has been a big issue for industrial applications which require fast output. Here, we introduce a misalignment estimation method which is accelerated through the whale optimization algorithm by running in parallel on Central Processing Units (CPUs), named pWOA, to reduce computing time. The proposed method shows more accurate and faster calibration compared to other population-based algorithms, including the parallel genetic algorithm and the parallel particle swarm optimization, and much faster than that of the exhaustive search both in simulations and in real experiments. In addition, this cost-effective technique can address global non-convex optimization problems with heavy loss functions including reflective FP.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Optimization', 'Whale optimization algorithms', 'Statistics', 'Sociology', 'Parallel processing', 'Mirrors']","['Microscopy', 'technologies for computing', 'other imaging technique']"

"The triple-band (S+C+L) transmission system using only C-band transceivers and all-optical wavelength conversions (AOWCs) without S- and L-band optical transceivers have been proposed. Although an AOWC employs highly nonlinear fibers, it is not applicable to photonic integrated circuits (PICs). For a device with successful wavelength conversion, a silicon-rich nitride (SRN) waveguide provides superior performance, as it is applicable to PIC and facilitates a higher Kerr nonlinearity than conventional stoichiometric silicon nitride waveguides. Thus, in this study, we propose an all-optical simultaneous wavelength conversion method that can be cost-effectively fabricated on a PIC based on four-wave mixing in SRN waveguides. Following an explanation regarding the design of an SRN waveguide for wideband AOWC, the successful operation of a double-stage AOWC of 64-channel 64-Gb/s QPSK signals between the C+L bands and the S-band is demonstrated, which is useful for wideband transmission systems.","['Phase shift keying', 'Optical wavelength conversion', 'Photonic integrated circuits', 'Silicon nitride', 'Wavelength division multiplexing', 'Transceivers', 'Optical fiber devices']","['All-optical signal processing', 'optical fiber communication', 'silicon photonics', 'wavelength conversion', 'wavelength-division multiplexing']"

"Structured Light Illumination Microscopy (SIM) has proved itself as a very effective method to improve the resolution of a widefield (WF) fluorescent microscope. In this paper, we demonstrate a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) imaging with the SIM, using a moving fringe (MF) illumination pattern. Instead of the standard three-beam standing wave illumination pattern, our method requires a two-beam one, varying along the optical axis. Each axial layer of the MF illumination pattern contains single-spatial-frequency interference fringes, traversing the space with its own speed (temporal frequency), proportional to the axial offset of such layer from the excitation plane. The different axial layers of a fluorescent object, excited with the MF illumination, will emit a continuous amplitude modulated fluorescent signal with the frequency of modulation proportional to the temporal frequency of the moving fringe pattern. The fine 3D image reconstruction is achieved via extracting the spatial location of the fluorescent object from the temporal frequency of amplitude modulated signal emitted by it. Since in our approach the problem of 3D image reconstruction is reduced to the problem of accurate temporal frequency estimation, any of the well-known spectrum estimation techniques can be applied to the problem, allowing the axial resolution improvement far beyond the limits of the classical 3D SIM. In this research, we suggest using the Minimum-norm method for the proposed MF SIM system, which gives a superior resolving power in spectrum estimation. Simulation results show that such a simple and rapid hardware implementation in combination with a straightforward signal processing method can, however, deliver an improvement in axial resolution far beyond the classical 3D SIM approach.","['Lighting', 'Three-dimensional displays', 'Image resolution', 'Microscopy', 'Gratings', 'Spatial resolution', 'Fluorescence']","['Super-resolution 3D imaging', 'structural light illumination', 'Minimum-norm spectrum estimation']"

"Progress in epitaxial design is shown to enable increased optical output power P opt and power conversion efficiency η E and decreased lateral far-field divergence angle in GaAs-based distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) broad-area (BA) diode lasers. We show that the wavelength-locked power can be significantly increased (saturation at high bias current is mitigated) by migrating from an asymmetric large optical cavity (ASLOC) based laser structure to a highly asymmetric (extreme-triple-asymmetric (ETAS)) layer design. For wavelength-stabilization, 7 th order, monolithic DBRs are etched on the surface of fully grown epitaxial layer structures. The investigated ETAS reference Fabry-Pérot (FP) BA lasers without DBRs and with 200 µm stripe width and 4 mm cavity length provide P opt = 29 W (still increasing) at 30 A in continuous-wave mode at room temperature, in contrast to the maximum P opt = 24 W (limited by strong power saturation) of baseline ASLOC lasers. The reference ETAS FP lasers also deliver over 10% higher η E at P opt = 24 W. On the other hand, in comparison to the wavelength-stabilized ASLOC DBR lasers, ETAS DBR lasers show a peak power increment from 14 W to 22 W, and an efficiency increment from 46% to 60% at P opt = 14 W. A narrow spectral width (< 1 nm at 95% power content) is maintained across a very wide operating range.

"Visible light communication (VLC) based on image sensor (IS) as the receiver is one of the supplementary technologies of radio frequency communication. By combining with image processing technology, VLC has various applications in smart home, underwater communication and intelligent transportation system (ITS). In the paper, it focuses on the vehicle positioning service provided by VLC in ITS. For the weak image spatial separability caused by long-distance VLC transmission between the vehicle and the infrastructure, it will lead to serious deterioration in communication and positioning performance. Thus, a deep learning-assisted IS-based visible light positioning (VLP) scheme is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. At the transmitter, a novel coding method is proposed to support both short-distance and long-distance communication based on VLC in ITS.

The phase distribution design method inherits the projection optimization idea from the generalized adaptive-additive algorithm; however, a striking difference here is that the iteration plane is not just one but multiple, which means the method promises to be not only suitable for creating phase distributions for multibeam independently lateral scanning but capable of creating phase distributions for independently axial scanning as well. Both simulations and experiments were conducted to investigate the performance of the method; simulation agrees with experimental results, which validates the effectiveness of the method proposed. The technique described in this paper could provide a promising convenient multibeam generating and 3-D scanning for ladar, laser weapons, laser micromachining, etc.","['Phased arrays', 'Lenses', 'Design methodology', 'Iterative methods', 'Diffraction', 'Lasers', 'Laser beams']","['Diffractive optics', 'phased arrays', 'multi-beam', '3-D scanning']"

"Circadian stimulus ( CS ) is a popular metric for evaluating circadian effects of light. However, the determination of its value is complicated. In this work, the possibility of developing a simplified model to accurately estimate CS values has been investigated. It is found that: i) the CS 2018 model itself has an important limitation: a very small perturbation in spectrum could result in a significant change in CS value, which fundamentally limits the development of a simplified model based on photometric or colorimetric inputs. ii) such a limitation is effectively reduced by the latest CS 2021 model, and therefore a simplified model can be developed to estimate the value of CS 2021 based on illuminance, correlated color temperature, a constraint of color rending index, and the factors of the continuous light exposure duration t and the spatial distribution of circadian light exposure f . The simplified model is developed and validated by using a comprehensive data set containing 395923 lighting spectra. The small deviations in CS value, which is less than 0.087 and 0.052 for warm and cool white light sources, respectively, show that the proposed simplified model could serve as an accurate and convenient tool for practical circadian lighting design.","['Measurement', 'Lighting', 'Sensitivity', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Indexes', 'Pigments', 'Mathematical models']","['Circadian metric', 'non-visual effect', 'circadian stimulus', 'spectral power distribution', 'circadian lighting']"

It is demonstrated that the ESMNF can confine most of the light in the low-index region and hence lead to large field enhancement. Benefiting from the large low-index power confinement factor and the field enhancement, the ESMNF also yields significant nonlinearity enhancement by the proper selection of materials. In addition, large birefringence between the two fundamental polarized modes is observed, due to the breakage of the circular symmetry for the core. The nonlinearity and low-index confinement properties of a more practical elliptical-slot embedded suspended microstructure fiber are also studied.","['Materials', 'Indexes', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical refraction', 'Optical variables control', 'Refractive index']","['Fiber optics', 'fiber design and fabrication', 'nonlinear optics', 'fibers']"
"A stable and tunable linear-polarization fiber ring laser with a high side-mode-suppression ratio (SMSR) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated by using a compounded fiber filter, which is composed of a dual-pass Mach-Zehnder interferometer filter incorporating one segment of polarization-maintaining fiber and a high finesse filter. By adjusting the polarization controllers, the output laser can be tuned from 1560.37 to 1568.56 nm and an SMSR as high as 72 dB is achieved. In addition, the peak power fluctuation and wavelength shift are monitored to be less than 0.08 dB and 0.02 nm over an hour. Due to the introduction of the compounded fiber filter as a wavelength selector, the side mode of lasing output can be effectively suppressed and mode competition can be weakened. As a result, the SMSR of lasing output is increased and power stability is improved.","['Optical fiber filters', 'Ring lasers', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Laser stability']","['Compounded fiber filter', 'fiber laser', 'high SMSR', 'linear-polarization', 'stable tunable']"

This configuration is able to mimic the real structure of remote-phosphor-based WLEDs. A comparison between the transmission- and traditional reflection-type measurements have also been carried out. Results show that the LCE and EQE are lower for the former than for the latter. Reasons are due to part of directly detected reflective blue lights and re-absorption of the blue light by the phosphor plate. Furthermore, by using the transmission-type system, optical properties of phosphor-plate samples with different thicknesses and different mass ratios of the mixture are analyzed under various current levels.

Benefitting from varying the pump direction rather than the cavity axis, the OPO cavity was unaffected so that the stability of the output signal energy and beam direction could be maintained, which greatly facilitates subsequent applications.

We polished a large angle on the fiber terminal facet in the sample arm to make a non-rotational symmetric beam with different numerical apertures (NA) for the two axes vertical to the optical axis. By sacrificing the resolution in the out-of-plane transverse direction, the elliptical beam mitigated the aberration introduced by the focusing optics in the OCT system. The elliptical beam with a doubled NA in the in-plane transverse direction promoted the axial field-of-view (FOV) by about 50% and increased the signal back-coupling efficiency by about 25%.

"The noise suppression of high-resolution range profile (HRRP) is a prerequisite for Geiger-mode of avalanche photodiodes (GM-APD) lidar to achieve precise sensing. However, it is difficult to balance the suppression effect and the integrity of detailed information. Considering this problem, we propose a Bayesian network-based improved loop filter (BNILF) for abnormal noise suppression. Based on the ILF, the Bayesian non-average local filtering model is established to calculate a distance of Pearson distance, which gives the criterion of noise judgment. Furthermore, the block preselection is used to accelerate identify abnormal noise and complete range profile noise suppression. To evaluate the performance of this algorithm, simulation and physical system experiments are carried out. The results show that the proposed algorithm has a better noise suppression effect and a higher detailed information protection ability in comparison with the existing typical approaches.","['Noise reduction', 'Filtering algorithms', 'Information filters', 'Bayes methods', 'Machine learning algorithms', 'Laser radar', 'Licenses']","['Range profile noise suppression', 'detail protection', 'intelligent filtering', 'Bayesian network', 'fast calculation']"
"Reflective-type Fourier ptychographic microscopy, an outstanding solution for surface inspection, employs a phase retrieval algorithm to reconstruct a high-resolution image with a wide field-of-view. This technique is time-consuming because it requires processing a large number of low-resolution images coming from the dark-field illuminator and bright-field illuminator. To decrease the computation time, we propose a new Fourier ptychography recovery method running in parallel in a graphics processing unit. We also utilized an adaptive step-size incremental gradient descent searching algorithm. The approach was validated by measuring a USAF reflective resolution target and by inspecting the surface of a smartphone integrated circuit.

"Simultaneously high quality-factor ( Q ) and transmission ( T ) are highly desired in various optical, photonic, and optoelectronic applications such as filters, sensors, photodetectors and lasers. However, a trade-off between high Q and high T exists widely in optical systems thanks to the different physics triggers underneath. Here, as an example, we experimentally demonstrate a Bragg filter composed of niobium pentoxide (Nb _2 O _5 ) and silica (SiO _2 ) stacks which enable high Q of 183 and high T of 91.3%. Balancing dissipation and radiation rate of the optical system is crucial to the performance of the device, which is validated by modulating the absorption of material (Nb _2 O _5 ) and the number of stacks. Further, with the principle the tunable Bragg filter is able to work in a similar way at optical wavelengths, i.e., maintaining almost unchanged FWHM (full width at half-maximum) and T values.

"An omni-azimuth angle sensor for tilt measuring based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) array is proposed. It is designed based on the sensitivity of FBG to axial traction. The sensor consists of a mass block and a cube frame connected by an FBG array. The FBG array consists of four FBGs. When the sensor is tilted at different angles, the axial traction of each FBG will change due to the pull of the mass block. The tilt angle of the sensing unit can be obtained by calculating the magnitude and direction of the resultant traction of the four FBGs. The array design and measurement theory of the sensor are introduced, and the sensitivity of the sensor is discussed. Experimental results show that the FBG array can be used to measure the omni-azimuth angle. The angle sensitivity varies unevenly with the tilt angle and the range of variation is 0.08 nm/° to 0.4593 nm/°. Using the spectrometer with an accuracy of 0.01 nm, the angle resolution ranges from 0.125° to 0.0218°.

Mode conversion can be achieved in multimode waveguides using optical analogy of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. The coupled mode equations (CMEs) for adiabatic mode conversion via an intermediate mode with wavelength detunings are derived for an engineered step-index multimode waveguide. It is shown that the detunings cause diabatic coupling of adiabatic modes and result in lowered conversion efficiency. The Landau-Zener (LZ) model of nonadiabatic crossing is used to analyze the spectral response of the mode converters and shown to be in good agreement with numerical solutions of the CMEs and beam propagation simulations. The analytical expressions from the LZ analysis offer useful insight into the spectral properties of the mode converters and suggest bandwidth tunability of these devices. We demonstrate bandwidth tunability of the mode converter by a numerical example.,"['Optical waveguides', 'Couplings', 'Mathematical model', 'Bandwidth', 'Numerical models', 'Analytical models']","['Waveguides', 'theory and design', 'waveguide devices']"
"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), confirmed as an efficient technique, has been applied in optical wireless communications (OWCs) to improve the transmission rate. However, the disadvantage of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) also brings into the OWC systems, especially for multi-user communications, resulting in low power efficiency. This paper proposes beam domain MIMO-OFDM OWCs with PAPR reduction. We describe the MIMO-OFDM OWC system architecture and derive the achievable sum rate and PAPR for multi-user OFDM systems, which are dominated by the precoding vectors. To reduce the PAPR, we design the precoding vectors to maximize the sum rate under the PAPR constraint. We propose an iterative process to obtain a candidate optimal solution by the sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method. Furthermore, we prove that the PAPR increases with the number of users and propose a low complexity beam scheduling and power allocation algorithm. Numerical results validate that the proposed schemes can efficiently improve the transmission rate and reduce the PAPR.","['Peak to average power ratio', 'Precoding', 'Optical beams', 'Wireless communication', 'High-speed optical techniques', 'Optical distortion', 'Time-domain analysis']","['MIMO-OFDM', 'PAPR reduction', 'multi-user optical wireless communications', 'beam domain']"

However, the bending-induced mode distortion will change the TMI coefficient and influences the TMI threshold. In this work, we analyzed the bending effects on the mode profiles by inducing different refractive index tilts corresponding to different bending radii. With these mode profiles and with different bending conditions, a modified TMI coefficient was calculated to analyze the bending effects on TMI for different fibers.

The detection and wavelength recognition of trichromatic light are accomplished by the photoreceptors with RGB filters. The ASC, fabricated in a standard CMOS technology, activates the competition among photoreceptors to select the principal color-component feature defined as the attentional focus. The number of focuses and resolution can be changed with a top-down stimulus. Electrical test results show that the ASC can select and interpret the most important color-component feature. In optical tests, the ASC chip-based unit can extract the principal color-component of single-color and dual-color light in real-time to complete color recognition. The percentage ratio between the intensity of stray light relative to the light with maximum intensity is up to 93.58%. And the maximum achievable recognition frame rate is 1 kHz, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than the frequency of the biological vision systems.

"Compared with conventional lenses, metalenses can offer smaller form factor, light weight and new functionality, and have become the focus of the recent investigations of metasurface. To date, quite a lot of studies have been reported for chromatic aberration correction of metalenses.

Generally, the design is time-consuming.

Analytical expressions of the outage probability and average bit error rate (ABER) are obtained with the help of state transition matrix. The average packet delay of the system is also evaluated with the help of obtained outage probability. The performance of the considered system is analyzed for different values of K and L . The performance is then further compared with the non-buffer-aided (NBA) cooperative relaying for FSO communication systems and it has been observed that the proposed buffer-aided FSO system significantly outperforms the NBA FSO systems for entire range of turbulence.

"Wavelength-division-multiplexed passive optical network (WDM-PON) has been widely deployed for the high-speed, reliable transmission and low-cost properties. The physical layer identity authentication in WDM-PON becomes increasingly prominent. Recently, many device fingerprint based identity authentication schemes are proposed. However, these schemes only realize constant fingerprint, which will be acquired by illegal ONU after optical spectrum analysis. Therefore, the higher-level security requirement cannot be satisfied. To solve the problem, we propose a physical layer identity authentication method in WDM-PON by exploiting the channel characteristics based adjustable fingerprint with deep neural networks (DNNs). By secretly negotiating with legal optical network units (ONUs) on the lengths of the local fibers applied by them, the optical line terminal (OLT) can acquire the unique channel characteristics fingerprint obtained by each legal ONU. It should be noted that the fingerprint can be adjusted by modifying the length of the local fiber. Moreover, the same number of DNNs as legal ONUs are trained for fingerprint identification. Simulation results show 100% identification accuracy for illegal ONU when the length deviation between two fibers applied by legal ONU and illegal ONU is greater than 1.5 km.

"Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM), an emerging computational imaging technology, can realize wide-field and high-resolution simultaneously and thus achieves great success in biomedical fields. The computational imaging process, however, also accumulates various but inevitable noises into measurements. Conventional deep based reconstruction methods simply ignore the existence of noise and integrate all features from measurements for prediction, which severely degrades the quality of reconstructed images. To mitigate this issue, we present a novel network, dubbed DeUnet, that adaptively filters out noise during reconstruction through a new cross-level channel attention mechanism. Specifically, DeUnet comprises of three key stages: encoding, denoising and decoding. The encoding stage abstracts hierarchical features from input measurements. The denoising stage learns to re-calibrate channel-wise feature responses from multiple levels in a collaborative manner. It selectively highlights informative channels while suppressing noisy ones by exploiting long-range dependencies among features across multiple resolutions. The decoding stage integrates denoised features to reconstruct final intensity and phase images. Extensive experiments on both the simulated and real data well demonstrate the effectiveness of DeUnet in suppressing noise. In particular, DeUnet can produce reconstruction results of higher quality and more valuable details, especially for phase images, compared to previous state-of-the-arts.","['Image reconstruction', 'Feature extraction', 'Image resolution', 'Licenses', 'Noise measurement', 'Pupils', 'Optical variables measurement']","['Fourier ptychographic microscopy', 'image reconstruction', 'neural network', 'channel attention mechanism']"

"Although surface plasmon resonance (SPR) antennas have been integrated into CMOS THz detectors as an alternative to the traditional radio-wave antenna, spatial crosstalk of SPR antenna in detector arrays remains an issue and there is little study in this field. In this paper, a CMOS THz detector array at 0.65 THz with on-chip SPR antennas is designed in standard CMOS technology and the pixel crosstalk related to the SPR antenna parameters are investigated. Simulation results show that the adjacent SPR antenna spacing significantly affect the antenna crosstalk due to the surface wave propagation. To suppress the pixel crosstalk, the adjacent SPR antenna spacing is designed as 1.65 times larger than half of the antenna size. Under the condition, the S12 parameter between the adjacent antennas is reduced to -15 dB. High antenna isolation can be further available by the increase of the isolation layer thickness of the pixel up to 1 μm. Based on the simulation results, a 1×16 THz detector array at 0.65THz was fabricated. The experimental results show that the pixels in the array achieve uniform NEP , with an average value of about 32.6 pW/Hz 0.5 and a standard deviation coefficient of about 9.6%.

"High resolution imaging techniques will play an essential role in the future smart imaging applications to provide potential solutions for accurate detection, monitoring and classification of the target. The potential of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems to acquire high resolution images has opened new frontiers and led to its exploration in new applications. The conventional microwave radar imaging suffers limited range resolution in the sub-millimeter wave range and optical imaging methods are constrained by the diffraction limit. In the terahertz (THz) regime of the spectrum, the SAR systems could be operated in all the weather, all the time and are capable of penetrating through clouds, smoke, dust etc. to achieve high resolution images beyond the diffraction limit. The curved SAR presents a SAR system created by circularly encircling the target scene. The Circular SAR and Spiral SAR which are based on a circular and cylindrical spiral scanning trajectory, respectively are the scanning methods used for curved SAR. In this paper, we have explored a new toolbox that enables the rapid development of near-field THz-SAR imaging systems and generation of large near-field THz imaging scenarios with the goal to support and facilitate data driven research such as deep learning in the THz community through synthetically generated SAR images as well as its potential for THz based high resolution and 2D/3D near-field imaging application. Initially, the potential advantages of THz-SAR over Microwave SAR and optical imaging methods are presented. Further, a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar testbed is simulated in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) configuration for the target frequency band. Moreover, the circular and cylindrical SAR scanning methods are explored for near-field imaging of point targets to obtain 2D and 3D THz-SAR images, respectively. Also, the radar images are reconstructed using the Back Propagation and Polar Formatting Algorithms, focusing on short range applications like indoor environments. Finally, the SAR performance evaluation metrics are reported and a roadmap for future work is presented.","['Imaging', 'Synthetic aperture radar', 'Radar imaging', 'Image resolution', 'Microwave theory and techniques', 'Microwave imaging', 'Radar']","['Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)', 'THz imaging', 'circular SAR', 'cylindrical SAR', '2D and 3D imaging', 'near-field', 'radar image reconstruction', 'high resolution imaging', 'reconstruction algorithms', 'MIMO', 'FMCW']"
"A D-shaped fiber-optic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor with MXene (Ti3C2Tx) is proposed as the sensing enhancement material. A spin coating method was used to cover the gold film D-shaped fiber SPR sensor with a layer of MXene.

"In recent years, Kramers-Kronig (KK) receiver has been widely studied because of its simple structure and the ability of digital signal processing (DSP) to recover complex value signals. One practical structure is detecting the optical signal with an AC-coupled photodetector. However, the direct current (DC) component of the photocurrent will be lost, in which case the KK algorithm ceases to be effective. To restore the lost DC component, we propose a simple data-aided method to estimate the DC component by the information of signal mean power stored in the designed data-aided sequences. We introduce a correction coefficient to evaluate the accuracy of our DC estimation by comparing it to the conventional DC sweeping method. Furthermore, the coefficient can be used to combat the DC estimation deviation. We carry out both simulations and experiments to study the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the DC component can be effectively recovered and the system performance is close to the results of the DC sweeping method. At the same time, in the case of low optical signal-to-noise ratio, optimization of correction coefficient can effectively improve the system performance.","['Estimation', 'Optical noise', 'Photoconductivity', 'Payloads', 'Optical receivers', 'System performance', 'Signal to noise ratio']","['Kramers-Kronig receiver', 'digital signal processing']"
"An equivalently discrete coupling coefficient (EDCC) distributed feedback (DFB) semiconductor laser with EDCC grating is numerically investigated and experimentally demonstrated; the EDCC grating structure is designed by discretizing the duty cycle of sampled Bragg grating along the laser cavity, i.e., the cavity is divided into some subsections, and the duty cycle is constant in each subsection while it is different between two adjacent subsections, instead of the truly discrete coupling coefficient grating profile realized by discontinuously varying the duty cycle and/or etching depth of the uniform gating pitch. Moreover, the EDCC grating is fabricated by combining the conventional holographic exposure with a micrometer-level photolithography, which will simplify the fabrication process and reduce the fabrication cost. Based on experimental data, the analysis of spectral behavior as a function of injection current shows that the stable single-longitudinal-mode operation has been realized, even at large injection current and high temperature.","['Gratings', 'Semiconductor lasers', 'Laser modes', 'Cavity resonators', 'Couplings', 'Measurement by laser beam']","['Discrete coupling coefficient', 'semiconductor lasers', 'distributed-feedback', 'single longitudinal mode operation']"

"In recent years, the toroidal dipoles have had a profound impact on several fields including electromagnetism.

In this paper, a method of neural network simulating the nonlinear relationship between the structural parameters of metasurfaces and its multipole scattered powers is proposed based on a deep learning algorithm. The forward network can quickly predict the scattered powers from input structural parameters, which can achieve an accuracy comparable to the electromagnetic simulations. In addition, with the required scattering spectrum as input, the appropriate parameters of the structure could be automatically calculated and then output by the inverse network which can achieve a low mean square error of 0.074 in training set and 0.18 in the test set.

"High control bandwidth is usually restricted in a photoelectric tracking system (PTS) based on a Charge-Couple Device(CCD) with time delay, which hinders a good tracking performance. Generally, a model-based delay-compensation controller called Smith predictor (SP) can help increase the controller gain to promote the bandwidth by separating delay from the control loop. However, the performance promotion is insufficient because the delay still stays in the forward channel which causes errors between output and input. And the increase of the controller gain is still limited due to the effect of model mismatch on stability. In this paper, to solve the problems, a delay-compound-compensation control (DCCC) based on improved SP by trajectory prediction and velocity feedforward is proposed. The additional trajectory prediction is used to further eliminate the effect of delay existing in the forward channel. The additional velocity feedforward is used to further reform the transfer characteristics limited by the controller gain. A Kalman filter-based design method of trajectory prediction is presented and the optimal design principle of feedback and feedforward controllers is given in the face of model mismatch. Experiments demonstrate that the DCCC is valid and could greatly promote the tracking performance in the low frequency.","['Delays', 'Trajectory', 'Feedforward systems', 'Bandwidth', 'Target tracking', 'Predictive models', 'Performance evaluation']","['Smith predictor', 'time delay', 'charge-couple device', 'delay-compound-compensation', 'trajectory prediction', 'velocity feedforward']"

In addition, for high order modulation, the demultiplexing performance of MBD is better than the equalization methods. So our results suggest that MBD should be an effective demultiplexing method and even a good candidate for equalization methods for high-order modulation formats.","['Couplings', 'Demultiplexing', 'Algorithm design and analysis', 'Convergence', 'Heuristic algorithms', 'Finite impulse response filters', 'Time-domain analysis']","['Mode-division multiplexing (MDM)', 'demultiplexing', 'hannel blind deconvolution (MBD)']"

"In this paper, we present the design guidelines for a tunable optical isolator in an SOI-based ring resonator with two small time-modulated regions. By considering a physical model, the proper geometrical and modulation parameters are designed, based on a standard CMOS foundry process. The effect of the variation of the key parameters on the performance of the isolator is explained by two counter-acting mechanisms, namely the separation between the resonance frequencies of counter-rotating modes and energy transfer to the side harmonic. We show that there is a trade-off between these parameters to obtain maximum isolation. Consequently, by applying the quadrature phase difference one can obtain the maximum separation between the resonance frequencies and hence the minimum insertion loss, while the maximum isolation is obtained at the modulation phase difference of -0.78\pi , which leads to a higher insertion loss. Robustness of the design is investigated through a sensitivity analysis for the fabrication variations in the distance and width of the modulated regions. We demonstrate that there is a trade-off between isolation and insertion loss, and by varying the modulation parameters, we can achieve isolation of 18 (5) dB with 7 (1.8) dB insertion loss.","['Optical ring resonators', 'Optical modulation', 'Optical device fabrication', 'Isolators', 'Silicon', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Optical interferometry']","['Non-reciprocity', 'photonic integrated circuits', 'time-modulated silicon ring resonator']"

By using a dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator and a Mach-Zehnder modulator in parallel to realize carrier suppressed single sideband and carrier suppressed double sideband modulation, respectively, with a 90° optical hybrid and 90° electrical hybrid coupler, this scheme can implement two functions: simultaneous up- and down-conversion signal generation, or high image rejection in down-conversion.

"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access Passive Optical Networks (OFDMA-PONs), a solution for the next-generation optical access network, allows multiple optical network units (ONUs) to dynamically share subcarriers (SCs) to support efficient bandwidth allocation. In uplink transmission, multiple ONUs can share orthogonal low bit rate SCs to transmit data at different time slots (TSs) during the transmission cycle. In this paper, the dynamic subcarrier allocation (DSA) scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed for various ONU bandwidth requests. The novel scheme jointly allocates time slots, subcarriers, and modulation formats in a dynamic and flexible manner. The ONU can save transmit power by using a lower order modulation format while meeting the delay requirement. The simulation part demonstrates how the proposed DRL-based DSA scheme can be adapted to various situations, including 1) variation in the size of ONU bandwidth requests, and 2) variation in the weight of different indicators. The extensive simulation results show that, for the first time, the proposed DRL-based DSA algorithm achieves optimal traffic latency with substantial power saving, compared with the traditional two-dimensional DSA algorithms.","['Optical network units', 'Modulation', 'Passive optical networks', 'Delays', 'Bandwidth', 'Resource management', 'OFDM']","['Energy-saving', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'dynamic subcarrier assignment (DBA)', 'orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access passive optical network (OFDMA- PON)']"
"We investigate the spectral and amplification characteristics of Bi/Er co-doped fiber (BEDF) and Er-doped fiber (EDF), prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD). BEDF features a noise figure (NF) below 5.2 dB, the bandwidth with NF less than 4 dB is approximately 23 nm (1560–1583 nm), and that with a gain exceeding 25 dB is approximately 42 nm (1525–1567 nm). The quantum conversion efficiency (QCE) of BEDF at 1550 nm is 72.1% at a pump power of 300 mW. The saturated output power of BEDF at 1550 nm is 21.4 dBm. Raman spectra indicate that the maximum phonon energy of BEDF is lower than that of EDF. The fluorescence lifetime of the BEDF is 11.64 ms, which is longer than that of the EDF. These results show that co-doping with Bi ions could increase the fluorescence lifetime of Er 3+ , reduce the NF, and improve the QCE and saturated output power.

"Variation of leakage current in interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with different carrier concentrations achieved by coating the facet with antireflections (AR) coating was experimentally studied. Single-layer Al2O3 and double-layer ZnS-YF3, ZnS-SiO2, and Ti2O5-SiO2 AR coatings are applied to midinfrared (mid-IR) ICL devices to achieve reflectance ranging from 0.15 to 7 × 10 -4 . By monitoring the laser performance before and after coating, it was observed that, for lower reflectivity coatings, the leakage current appreciably rises with increasing carrier concentration, thus diminishing the slope efficiency improvements and, in fact, degrading the slope efficiency at very low reflectance. It was observed that the ratio of leakage to threshold current could increase by 17% for high carrier concentrations at very low AR coating values. The results also allow for experimental optimization of AR coatings for increased slope efficiency in mid-IR ICLs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an optimal value for the AR coatings in order to maximize the power in ICLs.","['Coatings', 'Quantum cascade lasers', 'Reflectivity', 'Threshold current', 'Materials', 'Indexes', 'Optical waveguides']","['Interband cascade lasers', 'anti-reflection coatings', 'slope efficiency']"
"The transverse spin and orbital-to-spin angular momentum conversion during strong focusing of light beams have attracted wide interest due to the novel physics behind and their broad potential applications. In this work, we study the effect of incident beam’s degree of polarization on the localized spin density of a tightly focused field. By modulating the correlation strength between two orthogonally polarized vortex modes of the incident beam, we find that the magnitude of the focal-plane transverse spin density component changes only slightly, while its spatial shape becomes an isotropic spin vortex with the decrease of the incident degree of polarization. Whereas, the longitudinal spin density, induced by the vortex phase, reduces its magnitude significantly with the decrease of incident beam’s degree of polarization. The behavior of the focal-plane spin density is interpreted with the two-dimensional degrees of polarization among the tightly focused field components. Furthermore, we explore the roles of the topological charge on enhancing the longitudinal spin density for unpolarized incident beam. Our results reveal the feasibility of spin-orbit interaction with partially polarized or even completely unpolarized light, such as the thermal light.","['Orbits', 'Lenses', 'Focusing', 'Polarization', 'Optical vortices', 'Correlation', 'Optical polarization']","['Degree of polarization', 'optical vortex', 'spin density', 'spin-orbit interaction of light', 'tight focusing']"

"Based on the coupling mode theory and numerical simulation, intramode-group coupling in orbital angular momentum (OAM) fibers with elliptical deformation is analyzed in depth. The elliptical deformation not only introduces a time delay difference between even and odd modes of the same high-order vector mode but also destroys the structure of the high-order vector modes; the structural damage depends on the strength of the elliptical deformation. When the elliptical deformation is relatively small, the structural damage of high-order vector modes can be ignored and coupling can be thought as occurring only between two OAM modes composed of the same high-order vector mode. While the elliptical deformation becomes larger, the structural damage cannot be ignored, coupling appears among four OAM modes in the same OAM mode group, and the coupling between two OAM modes composed of the same high-order vector mode is more serious. The results will pave the way for the establishment of accurate propagation models and the optimization of the OAM fiber design.","['Couplings', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Strain', 'Optical fiber theory', 'Indexes', 'Optical fiber dispersion', 'Optical fiber networks']","['Optical fiber communication', 'mode division multiplexing (MDM)', 'orbital angular momentum (OAM)', 'mode coupling']"

"Modulation classification (MC) has become a widely used technology, which is of great value in both commercial and civil applications.

The research results prove that under the same network structure and data quantity, both the correctness rate and the convergence speed of CFA are significantly improved in the communication experiment based on underwater visible light communication (UVLC). It is also worth mentioning that because of the particularity and complexity of the channel, UVLC system can be divided into different regions.

Two discrete LED arrays are produced from one 4 × 4 LED array with a parallel-connected pixel configuration. Such compact designs are useful for light emission or detection at the transmitting/receiving terminals of optical wireless communication systems.

"With the fast development in the fields of photovoltaics and integrated circuits, the measurement of surface topographies and micro-scaled defects has attracted intensive interests. However, existing measurement methods are time-consuming and unsuitable for in-situ detection. Therefore, a fast topographic measurement method is developed based on the deflectometric microscope system. Microscopic deflectometry is an attractive tool due to its high sensibility to surface slopes and large dynamic range of measurement. For the quantitative reconstruction of surface topographies from slopes, an integration method is developed based on the minimum spanning tree, and the integration path is designed based on a sparse representation and a curl map. The robustness and accuracy of the integration method are validated by numerical simulation and experiments. This method can achieve a high measurement accuracy with a high lateral resolution and a depth of field of 90 μm, hereby improving the manufacturing efficiency and quality of opto-electronics functional devices.","['Microscopy', 'Surface topography', 'Surface reconstruction', 'Image reconstruction', 'Cameras', 'Optical imaging', 'Optical variables measurement']","['Defect', 'deflectometry', 'in-situ measurement', 'surface reconstruction']"
"Single-image dehazing techniques are extensively used in outdoor optical image acquisition equipment. Most existing methods pay attention to use various priors to estimate scene transmission. In this paper, a fast single-image dehazing algorithm is proposed based on a piecewise transformation model between the minimum channels of the hazy image and the haze-free image in optical model. The minimum channel of the haze-free image is obtained by the piecewise transformation, which is a quadratic function model that we establish for the dark region, and a linear transformation model is established for the bright region. Using the minimum channels of the hazy image and the haze-free image, a transmission estimation model is established based on the haze optical model with adjustment variables. To obtain an accurate estimation of atmospheric light, we estimate the atmospheric light twice. Finally, the haze-free image is restored. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has minimal halo artifacts and color distortion in various depths of field, flat areas and sky areas.

Two independent metallic micro-heaters are incorporated on top of the MDR and the lower arm of the MZI.

"The scattering angle, the Haze ratio, and the field polarization factor of the frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser nonlinearly scattered from the semiconductor nanorod surface are investigated. Both the scattering angle and the reflected Haze ratio of the laser beam reflected from Si nanorod surface present a nonlinearly increasing trend with nanorod length. As the nanorod lengthens from 190 to 2760 nm, the scattering angle broadens from 2.5° to 25° and from 2.5° to 24°. Concurrently, the reflected Haze ratio increases from 5% to 22% and 3% to 21% under TE and TM-mode incidences, respectively. A significant polarization scrambling transfers the linearly polarization into an elliptical polarization, and the field polarization factor increases from 0.54 to 0.86 and from 0.42 to 0.84 under TE- and TM-mode incidences with an enlarging nanorod length from 190 to 2760 nm. The reflected Haze ratio is linearly proportional with the broadened scattering angle. However, the field polarization factor shows a gradually saturating effect at larger scattering angle. The theoretical calculation is used to quantitatively analyze the polarization scrambling effect, which demonstrates that the scattered wave nonlinearly depends on the surface corrugation and can be expressed by the second-order function of the surface corrugation strength. The strong correlations of the TE-mode scattering with the nanorod length and the TM-mode scattering with the laser incident angle are observed. The polarization of the reflected laser beam eventually transfers from a linear to an elliptical one with a nanorod length exceeding over 1 μm.","['Silicon', 'Laser beams', 'Scattering', 'Surface roughness', 'Rough surfaces', 'Optical surface waves', 'Surface emitting lasers']","['Scattering', 'nanostructures', 'optical and other properties']"

"Visible light communications achieve wireless communications using light sources such as lighting fixtures and electric signboards. The light sources need to blink at high speed to avoid flickering. However, the blinking frequency is much higher than the frame rate of the general-purpose cameras that are integrated into consumer devices such as smartphones. This paper proposes a method where the principle of the I/Q demodulator as employed in radio frequency communications is used to estimate the phase and amplitude of modulated light blinking at a sufficiently higher speed than the frame rate. This is achieved by using two cameras with slightly different exposure start timing and estimating the phase and amplitude from the pixel values of the light-emitting diode (LED) image in one frame for each camera. In contrast to the conventional method with a very short exposure time, the exposure time can be increased, resulting in higher efficiency of light capture.

"The measurement matrix in compressive imaging controls the crucial feature information for high performance recognition. In this study, a deterministic orthogonal measurement matrix design method using the discrete cosine transform and a compressive feature selection scheme are proposed to implement high-end computational optics for imaging. The selection scheme systematically evaluates the recognition importance for the frequency features, combined with a scaling of the contribution of the various coefficients used to produce a base matrix for the new group of measuring patterns, which ensures the minimal recognition difference for each individual order of frequency filters and combining a relatively complex expression to quickly find the best quantization values. The model parameters are gradually adjusted and eventually converge to the best result through training with a large number of pre-determined samples from the dataset and backpropagating the feature selection loss along with the recognition loss, and the data processing capabilities can be enhanced because the measurement matrix is a priori information for the recognition phase. The systematic ability of the proposed technique was verified through simulations and experiments on two standard datasets: MNIST and CIFAR-10.

"Multispectral image reconstruction, which aims to recover a three-dimensional (3D) spatial–spectral signal from a two-dimensional measurement in a spectral camera based on ghost imaging via sparsity constraint (GISC), has been attracting much attention recently. However, faced with abundant 3D spectral data, the reconstruction quality cannot meet the visual requirements. Based on the robust data processing capability of deep learning, a novel network called SSTU-Net3+ is constructed by improving U-Net3+ with a spatial–spectral transformer (SST). To enhance the feature representation of images during reconstruction, mixed pooling modules and new convolution processes are proposed to improve the performance of the encoder and decoder, with U-Net3+ as the backbone. To boost the quality of reconstructed images, with split and concatenate (Concat) operations, we construct SST modules by exploiting both spatial and spectral correlations of multispectral images to refine the spatial and spectral features. Furthermore, we employ the SST in the decoder to reconstruct the desired 3D cube. Given similar network parameters, experiments on GISC spectral imaging data show that, compared to convolutional neural network–based methods, the average peak signal-to-noise ratio of images reconstructed using SSTU-Net3+ is improved by 3%, the structural similarity is enhanced by 3%, and the spectral angle mapping is cut by 12%. Particularly, compared to differential ghost imaging and compressed sensing, the reconstruction quality of SSTU-Net3+ has been significantly improved. SSTU-Net3+ can process a large amount of 3D multispectral image data more efficiently and construct the target image more accurately than the abovementioned methods.","['Image reconstruction', 'Transformers', 'Imaging', 'Task analysis', 'Cameras', 'Correlation', 'Convolution']","['Multispectral image reconstruction', 'convolu- tional neural network', 'transformer', 'deep learning', 'ghost imaging']"

"The problem of long-distance imaging through time-varying scattering media, such as the atmosphere, is encountered in many science fields. Recent studies have demonstrated that random atmospheric variability can be considered a spatial light modulator in compressed sensing imaging. However, the quality of the reconstructed image needs to be further improved. In this paper, we propose a distributed cumulative synthesis method to improve the compressed sensing image reconstruction based on atmospheric modulation. For multiple original images of various types, the compressed sensing imaging simulation experiment with different sampling rates was conducted using the distributed cumulative synthesis method. The simulation results show that, compared with the imaging method using a single light source, the distributed cumulative synthesis method can effectively improve the quality of the reconstructed image, whether it is full sampling or undersampling. In addition, a sparsity impact factor is defined to quantify the reconstruction ability of the measurement matrix obtained by the distributed cumulative synthesis method. This value can be used as an evaluation index for the optimized design of the measurement matrix by the distributed cumulative synthesis method.

When the incident angle of light increased to 30° from 0°, the short circuit current of ordinary solar cell decreased 29.5%, while that of solar cell with photonic crystals reduced 12%. Correspondingly, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of ordinary solar cells was reduced 31.2%. In contrast, solar cells with photonic crystal decreased only 11.5%. The enhancement factor of the PCE of solar cells with photonic crystal to that of ordinary solar cells increases from 1.26 to 1.6 as the incident angle rises to 30°from 0°. In summary, solar cells with photonic crystal are less sensitive to the incident angle and could absorb more light without angle limits, then increase the PCE. These solar cells with photonic crystals are promising in low-cost and high power conversion efficiency solar cell fields.","['Photovoltaic cells', 'Short-circuit currents', 'Photonic crystals', 'Diffraction', 'Testing', 'Scanning electron microscopy', 'Physics']","['Solar cells', 'photonic crystal', 'photoelectric conversion efficiency']"

"Anisotropic plasmonic surface supports elliptic, hyperbolic and even flattened polaritons, which is quite interesting for the diffractionless and highly collimated propagation of infrared light at the nanoscale. However, direct real-space near-field observation of anisotropic plasmons as well as frequency dependent topological transitions in natural materials have not been realized. In this paper, we theoretically investigate real-space anisotropic plasmons in WTe 2 thin films by using a phenomenological cavity model, anisotropic near-field plasmonic images with specific interference patterns and isofrequency curves in momentum space have been demonstrated. Due to the frequency selective forbidden of plasmons along b axis, a topological transition from the elliptic to the hyperbolic regime is manifested. Moreover, the plasmons as well as topological transition present significant electrostatic-gating tunability. Our studies provide new insights into WTe 2 based plasmonic components for the manipulation of plasmon propagation, which capable of tailoring anisotropic two-dimensional light confinement in the far-infrared regime and can be applied to investigate other anisotropic materials.","['Plasmons', 'Dispersion', 'Polaritons', 'Optical imaging', 'Conductivity', 'Permittivity', 'Optical reflection']","['Plasmon', 'anisotropy', 'topological transition']"
"An independently tunable dual-resonance hybrid structure incorporating graphene is proposed to achieve selective light trapping and response tuning in the visible and near-infrared band. The incident light with different wavelengths are intensely localized in two separated resonant cavities via the synergetic effect of the guided mode resonances (GMRs) and optical Tamm states (OTSs), which leads to the strong enhancement of the light-matter interaction of graphene in different parts of the structure. The dual-band perfect absorption associated with critical coupling is achieved, whereas the two resonant modes can be independently tuned by adjusting the corresponding structural parameters. Furthermore, by dynamically changing the permittivity of the resonant cavities or the chemical potential of graphene, the absorption wavelength can be continuously adjusted and the absorption efficiency can be regulated stepwise.","['Absorption', 'Graphene', 'Dual band', 'Chemicals', 'Distributed Bragg reflectors', 'Permittivity']","['Graphene', 'dual-band', 'perfect absorption', 'active tunability', 'subwavelength structures', 'gratings']"

"Recently, visible light communication (VLC) has become a promising option for secure data transmission in industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs). In IIoT-VLC systems, small attocells are adopted to achieve higher spatial reuse rate, and the transmission of data, control and feedback bursts often requires high efficiency and real-time feature. Conventionally, multi-field (MF) frames are used in VLC systems which consists of sync header, channel training sequence, check field, etc. in addition to data payload. However, for short burst transmission, MF frames could result in efficiency loss and latency increase due to useless padding bits. In this paper, a novel coding scheme named integrated frame code (IFC) in physical layer to realize efficient and real-time transmission simultaneously is presented. IFC scheme reduces latency by simplifying transmission procedure and decreases overhead redundancy by integrated design. Specifically, we propose a joint soft-decision criterion for receiving without separate synchronization and channel estimation and then analyze its error performance. After that, we present IFC construction criterion and two design examples. At last, simulation results confirm that for short burst transmission, IFC achieves better efficiency and robustness than MF especially in moving process.","['Synchronization', 'Codes', 'Encoding', 'Training', 'Channel estimation', 'Visible light communication', 'Receivers']","['Attocell', 'frame coding', 'industrial internet of things', 'visible light communication']"

"Comparing with the application of charge coupled device (CCD) sensor, a kind of interference stripe noise (ISN) can be observed easily from the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensor-based digital holographic measurement (DHM) system because a series of optic coatings and filters are used in front of that sensor in order to improve its imaging effect. The improper assembly or the micro manufacturing error of these optic components may create the unexpected interference phenomena in the imaging sensor. To reduce that noise, an effective image processing method is developed. On one hand the Laplacian pyramid method is used to highlight the ISN and a cartoon-texture decomposition technique is carried out to remove the additive ISN. On the other hand, an improved Lee filtering is performed to restrain the multiplicative ISN. Extensive experiment results have shown that the image quality can be improved after the ISN reduction and this method is fit for solving a deionized water temperature estimation application where the texture complexity of target image is relatively low.","['Optical filters', 'Laplace equations', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical imaging', 'Adaptive optics', 'Holography', 'Holographic optical components']","['Digital holographic measurement', 'CMOS sensor', 'interference stripe noise', 'image denoising', 'temperature estimation']"

"A Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) temperature sensor was proposed by splicing a self-made hollow core anti-resonance fiber (HC-ARF) between two single mode fibers (SMFs). The HC-ARF was 2 mm long and one SMF was 20 mm in length. The SMF end face was coated with an Au film. When temperature varied from 45 °C to 85 °C, a sensitivity of 81.1 pm/°C was obtained at the waveband of 1550 nm∼1555 nm. When temperature varied from 35 °C to 95 °C, a sensitivity of 138.8 pm/°C was obtained at the waveband of 1571 nm∼1581 nm. Theoretical analysis suggested that the sensitivity of this proposed sensor can be easily adjusted by varying the length of the Au-coated SMF via the Vernier effect, which was confirmed by a subsequent experiment where the SMF length was varied from 20 mm to 170 mm. This work offers a simple sensitivity control method, and the proposed sensor is easy to manufacture, compact in structure, and convenient in performance control, which can be applied for a wide range of biological and chemical applications.","['Temperature sensors', 'Sensitivity', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Optical interferometry', 'Gold', 'Splicing', 'Reflection']","['Hollow Core anti-resonance fiber (HC-ARFs)', 'Fabry Perot Interferometer (FPI)', 'temperature sensor']"

"We consider error-rate prediction for dual-use lighting systems with visible light communication (VLC) functionality. Since light planning rather than communications engineering is usually the driving discipline for practical dual-use settings, we extract VLC channel parameters as a by-product from advanced 3-dimensional (3D) light-planning models. By this means, we attain realistic signal-to-noise ratios for exemplary positions of a VLC receiver, which allows us to predict corresponding end-to-end bit error rates (BERs). Specifically, our procedure accounts for important aspects of state-of-art lighting systems, such as realistic light distribution curves of employed luminaires, possible presence unmodulated light sources, and, particularly, adaptive dimming operations in response to prevalent sunlight. In this paper, we (i) devise a methodology for VLC systems with optical receive filtering to convert photometric quantities into radiometric quantities, (ii) present examples of BER predictions for selected modulation schemes within some basic office environments, and (iii) conduct an analysis of the resulting simulation accuracy for a particular 3D light-planning tool.

However, the optimization of such cavities remains more challenging than the uniaxial beams. Indeed, the spatial distributions of both the optical field and the material gain have to be simultaneously defined by the nuances of complex cavity geometry. In this work, we simulate spatial distribution of the bandgap in bi-axially strained Ge crossbeams. Starting from stress map calculations, we achieved the bandgaps mapping for all possible suspended strain configuration (i.e ϵ xx , ϵ yy and ϵ xy ), when merged with bandgaps modeling.

The simulation results show that the decrease of surface height distribution variance σ is beneficial to improve the optical image resolution.

"The bitelecentric lens system is widely used in many domains, such as 3-D measurements and tube inspection. The magnification calibration for such a system is a crucial problem for its further application in achieving precise measurements. However, it is difficult to obtain an accurate result using a general magnification calibration method. In this paper, the Moiré-based interferometry is demonstrated to accurately calibrate the magnification of bitelecentric lens system that increases the speed and precision of the measurement. Two special grating marks containing upper and lower parts with slightly different periods are designed to generate Moiré fringes. By analyzing the finally obtained Moiré fringes, the magnification could be determined through Fourier-based phase analysis and a phase unwrapping algorithm, and the further the deviation is from the theoretical value, the more obvious the differences between upper and lower periods will be. Both simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results indicate that the magnification could be calibrated at the accuracy of 0.4% with extraordinary sensitivity.","['Gratings', 'Calibration', 'Optical interferometry', 'Lenses', 'Imaging', 'Diffraction gratings']","['Moiré fringes', 'magnification', 'grating marks', 'phase analysis']"
"Gradient-descent-based digitized adjoint method offers a way to realize the high-efficiency inverse design of digital nanophotonic devices with diverse functions. However, the vanishing gradient problem encountered in the design of high-dimension devices may lead to significant inefficiencies, making it difficult to integrate novel functions on a single chip. Here, we propose a highly efficient digitized adjoint method for large-scale inverse design, called adaptive gradient-descent with momentum. It uses the first- and second-order momentum, instead of the gradient, to update the device pattern during adjoint optimization. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, we design a coarse wavelength division multiplexer and a three-mode power divider with design dimensions of 800 and 1360, respectively, which are approximately 2-4 times that of conventional digital nanophotonic devices. The simulation results show that, compared with the conventional gradient descent method, the momentum-assisted adjoint method has about 4-6 times higher efficiency and obtains better optimization performance, which provides a powerful tool for the inverse design of novel digital nanophotonic devices.","['Optimization', 'Performance evaluation', 'Permittivity', 'Nanoscale devices', 'Linear programming', 'Wavelength division multiplexing', 'Crosstalk']","['Inverse design', 'silicon photonics', 'adjoint method']"

"In this paper, we present a neural network-based framework to compensate for the nonlinear distortion of high-speed continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems. In practice, the nonlinear impairment of imperfect devices could bring interference to the measured quadrature values and thus compromise the parameter estimation procedure and the secure key rate. Specifically, for a high-speed CV-QKD system, the balanced homodyne detector (BHD) and the following analog-to-digital converter are the primary sources of nonlinear impairment. The nonlinear distortion effect will be more pronounced as the pulse repetition rate increases. We propose an autoencoder-based network to learn the inner patterns of distorted data and then compensate the quadrature measurements in real-time at the receiver’s side. The numerical simulation demonstrates that the excess noise induced by nonlinear impairment is reduced to the 10^{-3} level in the shot noise unit.

"Nyquist signals with low roll-off factors pose a challenge for non-data-aided blind symbol rate estimation problems in long-haul applications. We adopted the nonlinear least squares (NLS) approach to estimate the symbol rate of low roll-off factor signals. This method tolerates chromatic dispersion and additive Gaussian noise. In addition, this method can operate below two samples per symbol, thus enabling low-power-consumption receivers. Simulation and experimental results show that the mean squared error is below 10^{-4} with only 3000 samples needed for polarization-division-multiplexed (PDM) quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) or quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) systems with a roll-off factor below 0.1 for an optical signal-to-noise ratio greater than 12 dB. Compared with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, our proposed method has a more robust performance under low roll-off factor signals and in low-sampling-rate scenarios. The mean squared error remains the same for a nominal symbol rate (i.e., the ratio of the symbol rate to the sampling rate, also widely known as oversampling rate) ranging from 0.1 to 0.9.","['Correlation', 'Maximum likelihood estimation', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Wavelength division multiplexing', 'Optical noise', 'Licenses', 'Gaussian noise']","['Frequency estimation', 'nonlinear least squares estimation', 'non-data-aided']"
"Recently, an exceptional point (EP) was constructed in a coupled double-ring resonator. Generally, such non-Hermitian optical systems are realized via material selection and a spatially precise layout. However, because of material limitations, some system parameters cannot be changed after the waveguide is fabricated. In this study, We demonstrate a lithium niobate-based tunable system for controlling system dispersion and loss, the resonator structure made of lithium niobate is theoretically and numerically investigated and analyzed. Lithium niobate is chosen because it exhibits good electro-optic properties. Furthermore, the real part of the potential energy term of the non-Hermitian system is regulated using external electric field. Consequently, a frequency shift of up to 149 GHz is observed in the double characteristic peak of the transmission spectrum with a contrast of up to 0.43. In addition, a gain-influenced EP is observed in a coupled dual-ring resonator system by introducing gain material.

"Non-uniformity is a common phenomenon in infrared imaging system, which seriously affects imaging quality. In view of the problems of existing non-uniformity correction of infrared images, such as loss of image details and blurred edge of image, an improved non-uniformity correction method of infrared images based on convolution neural network using long-short connections (LSC-CNN) is proposed. The proposed method designs a long-short connection residual network structure suitable for non-uniformity correction of infrared image.The network depth is increased to fully learn the noise by short connections, image sizes are adjusted to reduce the number of parameters, the long connection is used to solve the problem of image information loss caused by transposed convolution, and a multiply operation is carried out to enhance the contrast of corrected images. Besides, batch normalization is utilized to improve the training speed. The experimental results show that LSC-CNN has excellent performance in non-uniformity correction of infrared images whether qualitative evaluation or quantitative evaluation.

"In this study, four cylindrical cavities with diameters of more than 10 mm are utilized to confine aluminum plasmas to improve the signal intensities of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS).

The delay time for both primary and secondary signal enhancements is postponed with decreasing the laser energy or increasing the cavity diameter. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) of spectra signal in different experimental conditions are discussed to illustrate the uncertainties of measurement.

"The recent interest in using visible light as a means of communication has opened up possibilities for using visible light for other applications as well, such as indoor positioning. Visible light offers higher bandwidth, immunity from electromagnetic radiation, and most importantly it can be seamlessly integrated into the existing lighting infrastructure. This paper proposes a visible light based positioning model for estimating an object’s three-dimensional (3-D) parameters such as height and radius in addition to location in an indoor environment. The model is built using neural networks (NN), trained by simulating numerous multiple object scenarios in an indoor environment. It also takes into account the shadowing effects so it can be implemented in a multiple obstacle environment. The proposed algorithm has numerous applications, such as positioning assisted communication, suspicious object monitoring and surveillance in an indoor environment. The proposed model achieves a location accuracy of 5.4 cm, which could be further improved to 4 cm at the expense of extra hardware. The accuracy in measuring the height and radius of the objects using the proposed framework is observed to be 4.39 cm and 1.27 cm, respectively. In addition, we also propose a methodology to optimize the power distribution to the light-emitting-diodes (LED’s) in order to get the optimum location accuracy while maintaining the total power constraint on the system.

"There has been increasing interest in deploying non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging systems for recovering objects hidden behind corners. Existing solutions need to calibrate the imaging system using auxiliary apparatus and additional detectors. We present an online calibration technique that directly decouples the transients, which are acquired by onsite scanning on a relay surface, into line-of-sight (LOS) and hidden components. We use the former to directly (re-)calibrate the system upon changes of scene - surface configurations, scannable regions, and sampling patterns, and the latter for hidden object recovery via spatial-, frequency-, or learning-based techniques. We also calculate a Gamma map from the LOS component to preview calibration effects for accurate transient measurements. The entire process of our calibration for 64 scanning points takes no more than 14 seconds on an Intel i7-6600H CPU. In particular, our technique avoids using auxiliary calibration tools such as mirrors or checkerboards and supports both uniform and non-uniform sampling in an onsite NLOS imaging system.

An electrical bandpass filter is used to filter out the spectrum after photodetection in order to realize the seamless antenna transmission.

The DML based approach reveals mildly better performance in comparison to the MZMs in terms of higher achieved signal-to-noise ratio and lower error vector magnitude (EVM).

"In-band full-duplex (IBFD) technology has become important for future wireless communications, due to its ability of increasing the radio-frequency (RF) spectrum efficiency. However, the benefits can only be realized if the self-interference (SI) is sufficiently suppressed. RF cancellation is important for IBFD systems due to its ability of SI mitigation. But it becomes more difficult for RF cancellation while the frequency and bandwidth increase. In real scenarios, the response of the multi-path SI channel is not frequency-flat, which also limits the cancellation performance. To solve these problems, we present a photonic-enabled multi-tap RF canceller in this paper. The proposed RF canceller has the ability of cancelling multi-path SI.

"Color shift keying (CSK) communicates information by emitting light that hops instantaneously from one chromaticity to another. This rapid hopping is too fast to be noticeable by human vision, which senses only the time-averaged color, as the human vision’s critical fusion threshold and critical color fusion threshold both lie under 100 Hz. That is, color shift keying exploits the human vision’s temporal ir resolution of instantaneous fluctuations across chromaticities .

"The widespread deployment of white light-emitting6 diodes (LEDs) for illumination provides a unique opportunity to create a flexible, accurate, and ubiquitous indoor communication and positioning system. In this paper, we exploit the location information obtained via LEDs to improve the communication performance of an indoor visible light communication (VLC) system. Specifically, we propose an optimal LED power management framework to maximize the average data rate across the room while satisfying the bit error rate (BER) and illumination constraint across the room. The maximum allowed localization error, as a function of the number of blockages and the LED irradiance angle, have been calculated. In addition, the closed-form expression for the BER is derived for the proposed optimal LED power allocation scheme. We have also formulated an optimization problem that will maximize the power savings among the LEDs with respect to the number of blockages and permissible error in localization. It has been shown that, by employing the proposed optimal LED power allocation will results in a significant amount of power-saving, which is approximately 40% for 4 LEDs configuration and 70% 26 for 8 LEDs configuration as compared to equal power allocation. Further, the maximum allowed localization error is found out to be 28 approximately 7 cm and 18 cm with 4 and 8 LEDs, respectively, to 29 achieve the maximum achievable data rate. Finally, it is shown that 30 the dimming range of up to 70% can be achieved for the proposed system.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Visible light communication', 'Resource management', 'Lighting', 'Location awareness', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Optimization']","['Visible light communication (VLC)', 'LED power management', 'power saving', 'localization', 'human blockage', 'matern hardcore point process (MHCP)']"
"Plasmonic nanohole arrays that are directly structured into the top metallization of vertical Ge-on-Si PIN photodiodes can be used to sense refractive index changes.

"Kerr optical frequency combs have found various applications in science and technology, and minimizing their pump power has become an important area of research. These combs are generated using a wide variety of platforms, with a size ranging from micrometers to millimeters, and quality factors ranging from millions to billions. It is therefore not trivial to assess the pump power requirements for comb generation when they have such a large diversity in terms of resonator properties and pump configurations. We propose a suitably normalized threshold pump power as a metric to optimize Kerr comb generation independently of the platform. This method allows one to evaluate the minimum threshold power solely based on the properties of the bare resonator, and independently of dispersion, detuning or coupling considerations.

"In this paper a generalized formulation for the spectral domain Green's functions of unit current sources embedded within a multilayer stack is presented. The current source can be either electric or magnetic. It can be oriented either parallel to the layers or perpendicular to them. The electric and magnetic fields due to these generalized sources are calculated. The proposed technique utilizes inward and outward recurrence processes in order to solve for the desired quadruple-dyadic Green's functions. It requires the calculation of 6 spectral coefficients only, from which all types of spectral Green's functions can be calculated. The proposed formulation is written such that the electromagnetic fields are directly obtained in terms of the current sources rather than the vector and scalar potentials with no explicit analogy with transmission lines. The dependencies on the z -coordinates of the source and field points are expressed explicitly, which is important for Volume Integral Equation (VIE) formulation. The proposed generalized formulation is applied on a number of plasmonic layer structures such as Insulator/Metal/Insulator (IMI), Metal/Insulator/Metal (MIM), and five-layer plasmonic/dielectric layer structure.

"Scattering media, such as biological tissues and turbid liquids, scatter light randomly and introduce several challenges when imaging objects behind them. The transmission matrix (TM) describes the relation between the input and output of a beam transmitted through a medium, which can be used to reconstruct a target located behind a scattering medium. However, the current TM methods cannot easily retrieve the phase distribution of objects inside or behind a scattering medium. In this work, a compressive sensing (CS) method to identify the TM of a scatter contained in an imaging system was investigated.

"We demonstrate a microfiber Bragg grating as the reflective refractometer with the function of self-photoheating. The rare earth-doped fiber provides not only the photosensitivity to the UV modulation but also the effective pump laser absorption and photoheating conversion. The rare earth-doped microfiber Bragg grating, which is cladding-removed by the hydrofluoric acid, can detect the tiny refractive index change with a resolution of 10 -4 RIU scale. The self-photoheating could be realized by 980 nm pump absorption and non-radiative transition process of the ytterbium and erbium ions, which are well-preserved by the core structure after etching. Monitored by the reflective grating signal, the photoheating can manipulate 30 °C increase of the device in the air, 8 °C in the ethanol, and 4 °C in the water. The second time-scale heating/cooling response allows the sensor to act as ad optical switch for engineering temperature.

"For the fronthaul link in the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, optical fiber is one of the most widely used medium, owing to its large bandwidth and low transmission loss. However, in some scenarios, especially the dense urban areas, the installation of fiber optic cables is costly and difficult to establish. Alternatively, the free space optical (FSO) link can be installed easily and spans complex terrain. In this context, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid FSO/Wireless transmission system based on bandpass delta-sigma modulator and real-time coherent transponder. Advantage of the proposed technique is twofold. Firstly, coherent detection is applied to improve the system sensitivity compared to conventional direct detection. Secondly, delta-sigma modulation (DSM) is utilized to greatly simplify the wireless transmitters and to enhance the bandwidth flexibility. Over a 50-m FSO and 1-m wireless link, a 64-QAM wireless signal at 1 GHz with 500 MHz bandwidth is successfully transmitted. With 16 wavelength division multiplexing channels, the total throughput of the system is up to 24 Gb/s. Meanwhile, the error vector magnitude (EVM) of all channels is around 2.68% and 6.51%, which are demonstrated after FSO and FSO/Wireless transmission, respectively. The results meet the requirement of the third-generation partnership project release 15 with EVM value of 8% for 64-QAM. Moreover, sensitivity of the real-time coherent receiver is lower than −48 dBm under the 7% forward error correction limit with bit error rate of 3.8e-3.","['Wireless communication', 'Wireless sensor networks', 'Optical fiber cables', 'Optical fibers', 'Sensitivity', 'Real-time systems', 'Costs']","['Free space optical communication', '5G wireless transmission', 'real-time coherent receiver', 'delta-sigma modulation']"

"In this article, we propose, design, and numerically assess a novel parametric refractive index profile for optical fiber, which we refer to as reciprocal-inverse graded index fiber (R-IGIF). The R-IGIF features a shape parameter \alpha that controls the refractive index behavior (i.e. concave vs convex). We performed a systematic scanning of parameter' effects; using finite element method in Comsol Multiphysics, in order to design R-IGIFs that handle robust orbital angular momentum (OAM) channels (i.e. low radial modes). The designed fibers possess high inter-channels separation ( \Delta n_{eff} \geq 1\times 10 −4 ) that outperforms standard step index fiber and inverse parabolic graded index fiber; hence, reduces channels crosstalk. Numerical simulations show that the supported OAM modes are of high purity ( \geq\! 99.9\% ), enabling low-level intrinsic crosstalk ( \leq\! -30\,dB ). Further investigations considered metrics over the C and L ITU-T bands including the cut-offs wavelengths, chromatic dispersion, differential group delay, effective area, and nonlinearity coefficient. Results show potential capability to achieve stable data channels transmission. Further assessments have been carried out under practical condition (i.e. bending) by evaluating the \Delta n_{eff} , the intra-mode walk-offs, and the confinement loss. The findings show great resilience to bending effects. Therefore, based on these deep physical investigations of modes carrying data, the R-IGIF could find application in next generation space division multiplexing SDM-Networks.","['Optical fibers', 'Optical fiber dispersion', 'Indexes', 'Refractive index', 'Optical fiber networks', 'Measurement', 'Crosstalk']","['Space division multiplexing', 'mode division multiplexing', 'specialty fibers', 'vortex modes', 'orbital angular momentum', 'transmission performances metrics']"

The resonance is identified to have a Bloch wave nature, existing only for its even-order modes, restricted by the coupling phase matching conditions in a reflection configuration mode. It is also shown that the resonance properties are largely subjected to the size of the grating grooves, where localized cavity mode can be excited for large-size grooves, leading to broad absorption peaks due to nonresonant losses and bringing in new absorption peaks resulting from cavity resonances in the grooves.","['Gratings', 'Metals', 'Absorption', 'Reflection', 'Dielectrics', 'Optical surface waves', 'Surface waves']","['Subwavelength structures', 'gratings', 'resonance', 'absorption', 'polarization']"

"The diffraction characteristics of several types of phase gratings often etched on the substrate by the micro/nanofabrication techniques are analytically explored using scalar-based analysis in this paper. The process of an incident wave being reflected or transmitted by the diffraction grating is regarded as a process of modulation, and the reflectance or transmittance can be unified as the modulation index. The mechanisms of phase modulation, amplitude modulation, and the amplitude–phase hybrid modulation in different situations are discussed. Analytical results indicate that the diffraction efficiency is directly determined by the phase difference of adjacent features, i.e., the cyclically distributed ridges and grooves that induce different phase and amplitude variations. The absolute phase grating with phase difference equivalent to \pi has the maximum diffraction efficiency among all types of gratings.

"We present a compact, diffuser assisted, single-pixel computational camera. A rotating ground glass diffuser is adopted, in preference to a commonly used digital micro-mirror device (DMD), to encode a two-dimensional (2D) image into single-pixel signals. We retrieve images with an 8.8% sampling ratio after the calibration of the pseudo-random pattern of the diffuser under light-emitting diode (LED) illumination. Furthermore, we demonstrate hyperspectral imaging with line array detection by adding a diffraction grating. As the random and fixed patterns of a rotating diffuser placed in the image plane can serve as 2D modulation patterns in single-pixel imaging, we do not need further calibration for spectral imaging case since we use a parallel recovery strategy for images at all wavelengths. The implementation results in a cost-effective single-pixel camera for high-dimensional imaging, with potential for imaging in non-visible wavebands.","['Imaging', 'Cameras', 'Detectors', 'Calibration', 'Hyperspectral imaging', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Correlation']","['Single-pixel imaging', 'spectral imaging', 'scattering medium']"

In the proposed technique, we exploit the training-sequence-based (TSB) carrier FOE algorithm to the CFSO communication system in the quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation format. A symmetric training sequence, tailored to the carrier FOE algorithm for atmospheric turbulence channel, is formulated to accurately identify the correct temporal position of a data frame from received signals.

In this way, the proposed technique significantly improves the estimation accuracy. Furthermore, by avoiding the time-consuming 4th power operation, the proposed method reduces the computational complexity while expanding the FOE range. Therefore, when compared with existing algorithms, our proposed technique can achieve more accurate timing, a wider estimation range, and lower complexity.

"In high-speed optical fiber communications, chromatic dispersion (CD) estimation is essential for the monitoring and compensation of CD-induced impairments. Compared with coherent detection, in short-reach optical communication systems, intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) is more widely used, and the existing dispersion estimation techniques usually require training signals or a large amount of data for curve fitting or machine learning. However, these methods cannot provide in-service estimation. This paper presents a novel technique for in-service CD estimation in IM/DD short-reach optical communication systems based on our derived analytical model. With the analytical model, the in-service CD estimation is realized via the direct power spectrum analysis of the received signal. Unlike previous studies that only work with single-frequency sinusoidal signals, the practical random data with the rectangular type of base waveform is considered in our model. Therefore, our method can be applied to the dispersion estimation of various pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) based systems.

"Van der Waals heterostructures of black phosphorous(BP) and Molybdenum Disulfide(MoS 2 ) is designed and evaluated for photodetection application from visible to mid-infrared wavelength up to 4.5 μm. The device possesses a low dark current less than 0.1 μA for short wavelength light. For visible and near infrared radiation, the contribution of heat and photo energy to current enhancement is analyzed. Dark current drift by joule heat and laser heat absorbed is observed in short waveband. The difference in response speed is believed to be a result of the competition of BP and MoS 2 photocurrent. Gate tunable response time and on-off ratio makes the device versatile in potential application. For mid infrared radiation, BP-MoS 2 heterojunction with a dedicated thickness tailoring of MoS 2 exhibits similar negative response as an intrinsic BP. The normalized detectivity is {D}^* of 2.02 \times {10}^8\ Jones for the 4.5 μm mid-infrared radiation. Elaborate reduction of the noise is conducted to get the time resolvable photo-response.

"The charge-coupled device-based Shaker–Hartmann wavefront sensor has been widely used to compensate for wavefront distortion in coherent optical communication. However, the influence of strong background light causes large errors when restoring the signal light wavefront. This study proposes a wavefront recovery method by combining a detector array with an optical nutation of the local oscillator. By adding a small rotation angle to the local oscillator, the wavefront slope is estimated according to the output of the change law of the mixed signal and the local oscillator light, and the multi-order Zernike mode is used to reconstruct the signal light wavefront. Simulation studies show that the root-mean-square value (RMS) and the coherence efficiency of the signal light wavefront were significantly optimized. Under direct sunlight, the estimation compensation error of the wavefront slope reached 0.008. Under strong turbulence, the mixing efficiency was increased by nearly 97.5 times, and the RMS was reduced to the original value of 0.048 The designed system has good background light compensation and wavefront recovery capabilities and is suitable for coherent optical communication under direct sunlight.","['Optical fiber communication', 'Local oscillators', 'Atmospheric waves', 'Optical filters', 'Optical distortion', 'Detectors', 'Estimation']","['Optical communication', 'Atmospheric turbulence', 'Shaker–Hartmann wavefront sensor']"
"Modal phase matching (MPM) is a widely used phase matching technique in Al x Ga 1-x As and other χ (2) nonlinear waveguides for efficient wavelength conversions. The use of a non-fundamental spatial mode compensates the material dispersion but also reduces the spatial overlap of the three interacting waves and therefore limits the conversion efficiency. In this work, we develop a technique to increase the nonlinear overlap by modifying the material nonlinearity, instead of the traditional method of optimizing the modal field profiles. This could eliminate the limiting factor of low spatial overlap inherent to MPM and significantly enhance the conversion efficiency. Among the design examples provided, this technique could increase the conversion efficiency by a factor of up to ~ 290 in an Al x Ga 1-x As waveguide. We further show that this technique is applicable to all χ (2) material systems that utilize MPM for wavelength conversion.","['Optical wavelength conversion', 'Optical waveguides', 'Optical frequency conversion', 'Photonics', 'Licenses', 'Indexes', 'Graphical models']","['Wavelength conversion', 'second harmonic generation', 'difference frequency generation', 'modal phase matching', 'compound semiconductor', 'Aluminum Gallium Arsenide']"

"A record net gain of 17-dB has been demonstrated in a 300-nm broadband single-mode Cr-doped crystalline core fiber (CCF) with a 19-μm core diameter and 18-cm fiber length. The gain-per-unit-length of the CCF, which is an impressive 94 dB/m, is significantly higher than that currently achieved in other rare-earth doped fiber amplifiers, such as Er and Bi-doped fibers. This high gain was achieved by matching the transmission mode between CCF and single mode fiber for improving the coupling efficiency. We controlled precisely the conical molten-zone in the growth process, as well as the optimization of the Cr 4+ concentration through thermal annealing and polarization pumping techniques. We also measured the noise figures of several core diameters, finding that the 19-μm core diameter CCF exhibited a noise figure 4.2 dB lower than the previous 25-μm core diameter CCF. This result is important because it indicates that the smaller diameter CCF is capable of providing even better signal-to-noise ratios. And the error-floor free data transmission of the CCF was successfully demonstrated at a rate of 10 Gb/s. This is an important achievement because it shows that the CCF has the potential to be used in high-speed communication applications.",[],[]

"We have proposed and experimentally demonstrated a high-speed and point-to-multipoint (P2MP) mobile fronthaul (MFH) downstream system based on the code-division multiplexing (CDM) and self-homodyne coherent (SHC) technologies. We find that compared with the traditional 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) signal transmission, the change of phase noise between two demultiplexed symbols is much larger in the CDM-16QAM signal transmission because it is the accumulation of phase noise change of n multiplexed symbols. Therefore, a low-complexity pilot sequence-assisted phase noise estimation algorithm is proposed and designed to compensate for the phase noise caused by fiber mismatch length, which makes it possible to use a low-cost distributed feedback (DFB) laser. Besides, the spread signal's distribution in the frequency domain of each code sequence is different, leading to different transmission performances between different remote radio units (RRUs). A power optimization scheme is proposed to balance the transmission performances of different RRUs by multiplying each channel's signal by a normalized weight factor at the transmitter. The experimental results show that the proposed system could successfully support the transmission of 245 Gb/s 16QAM signal from baseband unit (BBU) to 7 RRUs (each RRU could have 2 antennas to transmit signals at 2 polarizations) over 10 km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF).

"To suppress the fluctuation of light intensity during wavelength tuning caused by carrier induced optical loss, we utilized a single quantum well (SQW) inserted into the bulk core layer of distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs), called an active DBR structure, for a 2-μm-wavelength superstructure grating (SSG-) DBR laser. In the active DBR structure, some injected currents in the DBR regions are consumed for an optical gain in the inserted SQW, which suppresses the optical loss in the bulk core layer induced by the free-carrier absorption. The SSG-DBR laser fabricated with the active DBR structure exhibited a more than 8-nm lasing wavelength shift of a single SSG-DBR reflection peak. In addition, the reduction of light intensity was less than 2.7 dB when the total injection current of the front and rear DBR regions was 200 mA. This is significantly smaller than that of a conventional SSG-DBR laser that has the same device structure except for the SQW in the DBR regions, although a relatively large current was required for the wavelength shift. Evaluations of the lasing characteristics under various combinations of the front and rear DBR currents demonstrated that all seven SSG-modes could be selectively oscillated for wavelength tuning. In addition, the measured fluctuation of light intensities was less than 5 dB for almost all conditions even when the front and rear DBR currents were individually changed from 0 up to 100 mA. Furthermore, the active-DBR type laser simultaneously attained the quasi-continuous tuning range of 51.2 nm and the fluctuation of light intensity across the whole range of less than 2.5 dB which represents a significant suppression compared to the conventional SSG-DBR laser with the same laser cavity design.","['Distributed Bragg reflectors', 'Laser tuning', 'Semiconductor lasers', 'Indium gallium arsenide', 'Reflection', 'Semiconductor optical amplifiers', 'Measurement by laser beam']","['Distributed Bragg reflector laser', 'semiconductor laser', 'tunable lasers']"

"Numerous studies have shown that the use of PAM-4 modulation format for DFB lasers with integrated passive regions (DFB IPE lasers) can greatly improve information transmission capabilities. In this paper, it is found by theoretical analysis that a passive waveguide can reduce the photon concentration and injection current in the cavity under the same output optical power.

"We propose and experimentally demonstrate a high-performance micro-ring resonator (MRR) with a large free-spectral range (FSR) on the lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) platform. Mode crosstalk happens in LNOI waveguide bends because more than one mode is generated from the anisotropy of lithium niobate, which limits the minimum bending radius of MRRs. Mode properties of ridge waveguides on X-cut LNOI with different bend radii and wavelengths have been analyzed to remove the effect of mode hybridization and reduce the mode crosstalk. On this basis, a small radius MRR with large FSR and 3dB bandwidth is achieved. Further, to deal with the wavelength shift caused by fabrication error, a second-order micro-ring resonators (2 nd -order MRRs) filter with a box-like response and a high out-of-band rejection ratio is realized. Besides, a multichannel demultiplexing filter is realized based on 2 nd -order MRRs with low crosstalk (<−13 dB) at a channel spacing of 1.16 nm.

"In this paper, a novel kind of GaN light-emitting diode (LED) with P and N discontinuous ohmic contact electrodes and discontinuous current blocking layer (CBL) is designed and prepared. Multiple contact windows under the N- and P-electrodes formed by etching help realize the discontinuous ohmic contacts with the N-GaN layer and the ITO layer, respectively. Similarly, by etching a plurality of discontinuous openings with the same pitch in the CBL, a discontinuous CBL structure is formed. As compared with traditional structures, the discontinuous ohmic contacts can maximize the number of current paths which allow the carriers to be collected from all four directions, leading to a more uniform current spreading and thermal management. Furthermore, as the contacts are not continuous any longer, some of the otherwise removed materials (such as the active region) lying between the patches are saved. The optoelectronic characteristics, junction temperature, thermal resistance, and infrared thermography measurements are conducted and the current distribution is simulated. The results show that the novel LED structure has better optoelectronic performances and current spreading ability compared to traditional devices. At 150 mA current, the luminous efficiency is 15.2% higher than the traditional LED, the junction temperature is reduced by 4.9%, and the thermal resistance is reduced by 12%.",[],[]

"A novel optical frequency-hopping (OFH) scheme using dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator (DD-MZM) is proposed and demonstrated for secure transmission in fiber-optic networks. In the proposed scheme, by adjusting the phase difference between the radio frequency (RF) signals loaded on the two arms of the DD-MZM, and filtering the center carrier by fiber Bragg grating (FBG), thus the upper and lower output spectra can be realized randomly hop between the positive and negative first-order sidebands and serve as carriers for data modulation. And the data of different users are divided into many data slices in the time domain and then modulated to these carriers. To verify the feasibility of the proposed OFH scheme, we demonstrate an error-free transmission through 40 km fiber with 10 Gbps hopping rate and 10 Gbps data rate by simulation tools. In addition, we also establish a theoretical model to evaluate the security performance quantitatively, and the results show that the computing power required by illegal third parties to crack through brute force reaches 1.07 × 10 27 calculations per second under certain conditions, which is almost impossible.

"Due to the high path loss of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ultraviolet communications (UVC) channel, pulse modulation schemes, such as on-off keying (OOK) and M-ary pulse-position modulation (PPM), and photon-counting receivers are commonly adopted. Although M-ary PPM can be demodulated and decoded without the channel state information, its spectral efficiency is lower than OOK's. To improve the spectral efficiency of M-ary PPM in NLOS UVC, a power-domain multilayer-superposed transmission (MST) scheme with binary PPM (BPPM) is proposed in this work. Based on this scheme, the signal in each layer can be directly decoded without successive interference cancellation, which is necessary for other MST schemes in the power domain. Hence, a low complexity receiver in the NLOS UVC system can be realized. Additionally, the bit-error rate (BER) and achievable data rate (ADR) expressions of the proposed MST scheme are derived. Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to verify the analytical BER expression. The NLOS UVC system performance employing the proposed MST scheme is further demonstrated and compared with pure BPPM. The results indicate that with the optimal power allocation factor for each layer, the overall ADR of the NLOS UVC system with the proposed power-domain MST scheme can surpass that with pure BPPM.",[],[]

"A theoretical model, suitable for multiple structures of integrated vortex beam emitters, is proposed, developed and verified. Using the interference superposition of multiple plane waves in the far-field plane, which have the same wavevector in the z-direction, the expressions of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam field emitted from integrated devices are obtained. The results are applicable to OAM beams with larger or fractional topological charges, and consider different initial polarization states, which means different structures. Especially, when ϑ = 0, p = 0, the result is the same as those derived from the dipole model and is consistent with the previous experimental results.

"A new variational method for the modal analysis of 2-D waveguide structures is proposed in this paper. Maxwell's equations describing the modal properties of scalar and semivectorial guided waves in the 2-D waveguides are expressed as variational/minimization problems, which are then discretized in terms of a finite-difference scheme on a finite rectangular computational window. By applying a dynamic programming technique to solve such variational problems, a 1-D equation representing the relation between the modal fields on any pair of adjacent columns in the computational window can be derived. By using such 1-D equation in a stepwise fashion from one boundary column toward the other boundary column, a system of linear equations with the unknown column modal fields can be derived and then solved to give both the accurate modal indexes and the discrete modal fields. In the examples of one weakly guiding rib-type dielectric waveguide and another strongly guiding silicon-on-insulator waveguide, computational results show that a small size of the coefficient matrix for such a system of linear equations is adequate to cause a relative error of 10 -5 -10 -6 in the evaluation of the modal indexes reachable in an efficient manner. The results of the convergence tests show that the proposed method is at least an order of magnitude faster than the conventional finite-difference beam propagation method because of the transformation of a 2-D problem into a 1-D problem. Moreover, the proposed method is applied to investigate the modal properties of the conductor-gap-silicon plasmonic waveguide. The feature of the hybrid guided-mode profile is also observable from the modal field calculated by the proposed method.",[],[]

"The abrupt termination of periodic structures in hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber (HC-PBF) cladding introduces surface modes (SMs). This results in a high loss and small available bandwidth. This has become an important factor that restricts the development of HC-PBFs. For many years, there has been a lack of clear understanding of SMs. In this study, SMs were considered the main body of research. First, a pure HC-PBF platform was constructed to systematically observe the SMs inside the bandgap. The core wall was used as a control variable to achieve precise control of the SMs. The SMs are divided into two categories: fundamental and high-order SMs. We named the SMs and studied their characteristics, including the mode field shape, coupling bandwidth, and coupling speed. The coupling characteristics of SMs with different core diameters were compared and analyzed. Further, we compared the model with actual fiber to prove the practicality of the theoretical analysis.

"Underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) systems have been widely studied to achieve high-speed wireless communications. To investigate and design UOWC systems, a mathematical model to characterize the accurate performance of UOWC systems is important. However, the previous mathematical models of UOWC systems have limitations, which mainly focused on the line-of-sight (LOS) link, and only considered the vertical incident background light or optical filters with constant transmittance for simplicity. To overcome these limitations, we establish an accurate UOWC system model, incorporating the previously overlooked impact of signal and sun lights incident angles and including both LOS and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels. Our proposed accurate UOWC system model is validated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Results show that our proposed model can capture the changes of received powers of both signal and background lights with various transmitter and receiver alignments and orientations in both LOS and NLOS channels, which typically affect the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) and bit-error-rate (BER) performance of UOWC systems. Furthermore, we show that the incident angles of both signal and sun lights have significant impact on the system performance, and our proposed model can be used to optimize the PD rotation angle to improve the SNR performance. Therefore, the more accurate UOWC channel model established in this paper provides a fundamental framework for future UOWC system design and optimization.",[],[]

"High-speed directly modulated distributed feedback (DFB) laser is crucial for high-speed optical communication systems. The modulation bandwidth and frequency chirp of such devices are primarily affected by the differential gain and linewidth enhancement factor (LEF) of the quantum wells (QWs) in the active region. In this work, the optical gain properties of long wavelength AlGaInAs-InP strained quantum wells (QWs) with different crystal orientations are numerically investigated using the multi-bands k.p theory, which considers both valence-band anisotropic and nonparabolicity. Compared to the QW laser grown on a conventional (001) substrate, a higher differential gain, and smaller LEF are observed for the laser grown on the (110) substrate with the (110) plane as the mirror facet. This is primarily due to the reduced effective mass of the valence band. The dynamic characteristics of (001)-and (110)-oriented DFB laser is theoretically studied using the one-dimensional traveling wave model (1D TWM) at 25°C and 95°C.

"Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a computational imaging technique that combines a large field of view and high-resolution. It stitches low-resolution images captured under varying illumination corresponding to different angles in the frequency domain to realize quantitative phase imaging with high spatial bandwidth product. Our previous algorithm (AA algorithm) effectively solves the problem of noise interference and the algorithm is difficult to converge. In FPM experiments, the fluctuation of LED intensity is inevitable, which significantly affects the quality of reconstructed images. The usual solution is to perform intensity correction in the reconstruction algorithm. However, in this study, it is found that the AA algorithm is incompatible with the intensity correction method, which will decrease the convergence performance. To solve this problem, we develop a more general reconstruction algorithm based on the AA algorithm in this study. The simulation and experimental results show that the improved algorithm framework is compatible with the intensity correction method, resulting in an increase in intensity correction reliability and effectiveness.

A new microwave photonic signal processing structure for realising in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) mixing is presented. It is based on a dual-drive Mach Zehnder modulator (DDMZM) and an optical phase modulator inside a Sagnac loop interferometer. Two output IF signals with a quadrature phase difference are obtained by using two photodetectors to detect the upper and lower sidebands of the optical signal at the Sagnac loop output. A quadrature phase difference in the two IF signals is realised by biasing the DDMZM at the quadrature point. This has the advantage of very little quadrature phase errors as a standard modulator bias controller can accurately lock the DDMZM bias point. The optical phase modulator driven by an RF signal can be placed in a remote location for antenna remoting. Theoretical analysis and simulation show using the proposed I/Q mixer for image rejection can overcome the modulation index dependent image rejection ratio problem in the reported I/Q mixers based on a cascaded modulator structure. The Sagnac loop based I/Q mixer is experimentally verified with results show only ±1° quadrature phase error and more than 50 dB image rejection ratio over the operating frequency range of 6 to 20 GHz.,[],[]

"The photonic bandpass sampling has been proved to be potential in multi-carrier communication, frequency-agile coherent radar, compressive sensing, etc. It supports the direct down-conversion of multi-carrier signals using a low-speed analog-to-digital converter (ADC). We observed the distortion resulted from amplitude-modulation to phase-modulation (AM-PM) conversion caused by the saturated photo-detector in the photonic bandpass sampling link. The nonlinearity caused by the AM-PM conversion is theoretically analyzed, which is the 2nd harmonic distortion and has a phase difference of 90 degrees with the fundamental signal. Due to the AM-PM conversion, the 2nd harmonic distortion occurs even the Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) is quadrature biased in the photonic bandpass sampling link. Two comparative experiments were conducted to test the nonlinearity. When the MZM works at different bias points, the phase of the 2nd harmonic distortion will be different. In addition, we also compared the differences in 2nd harmonic distortion between standard continuous wave photonic links and photonic bandpass sampling links.",[],[]

Dual parallel I/Q modulators and 90-degree electrical hybrid couplers are used to obtain carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation of radio frequency (RF), intermediate frequency (IF), and local oscillator (LO) signals. The optical bandpass filter (OBPF) is employed to select the -1st-order or +1st-order sideband of the LO signal to realize up and down conversion.

"Computer-generated hologram (CGH) is a diffractive optical element that has been commonly used as wavefront corrector in the interferometer and can be accurately manufactured to meet the requirements of high-precision detection.

"Liquid-crystal spatial light modulator (LC-SLM) has been widely applied as a programmable digital device. However, the LC-SLM can only manipulate on light fields accurately under designated wavelengths since, when being uploaded a specific grayscale image onto it, the phase retardance offered by the LC-SLM is relevant to the wavelength of the incident light. This means that the calibration of LC-SLM is indispensable once the working wavelength changes. In this paper, based on a phase retrieval algorithm, a novel phase calibration method with high efficiency and accuracy is proposed for scaling LC-SLM. In the method, a 1-D phase retrieval algorithm for recovering the phase of a 1-D light field distribution is used to measure the voltage-phase characteristic curve of LC-SLM, where the gradient descent algorithm with a Root Mean Square propagation is introduced to obtain the phase. Simulations and experiments show that this method is stable and has the ability of anti-noise on some conditions and can eliminate the influence caused by crosstalk between pixels on the calibration.

"The characteristics of backscattered electrons near the surface of a back-side bombarded CMOS (BSB-CMOS) within an electron bombarded CMOS (EBCMOS) were studied based on the principle of electron-solid interactions and Monte-Carlo simulation method. We mainly focused on the angular distributions of backscattered electrons, the ratio of backscattered electron number to incident electron number (RBI), and the distribution of the distance between backscattered electrons and incident electrons ( D BI ). We studied how these characteristics were affected by the BSB-CMOS surface structure and incident electron energy. Firstly, RBI and the mean D BI vary with the incident electron energy, the surface material type, and passivation layer thickness. Meanwhile, a lower RBI may reduce device noise originating from backscattered electrons ( N BE ) due to the smaller number of backscattered electrons. Besides, the lower mean D BI may enhance the device resolution, because the backscattered electron beam is more concentrated. The distribution of backscattered azimuths ( {\it \Phi}_{\rm B} ) and the backscattered angle ( θ B ) follow uniform distribution and cosine angular distribution respectively, which are difficult to change.

The SiC- APD in this experiment was fabricated with a beveled mesa structure, with electronics designed to achieve passive Geiger-mode operation and to convert the avalanche signal to a transistor–transistor logic signal by readout backend. We attached the SiC-APD to a 4-stage thermoelectric cooler to vary APD temperature from 25 °C to −30 °C, and investigated dark count rates according to applied bias voltage at different temperatures. Breakdown voltages applied to the SiC-APD were also measured while adjusting APD temperature.

"We tested the imaging capabilities for variants of a 1550-nm swept-source fiber-based optical coherence tomography system with a telecentric system incorporated at the end of its sample arm. The system was designed for in vivo imaging of burns; therefore, we acquired images from samples located at distances greater than 24 cm from the exit of the telecentric system. Each system variation had a specific combination of diameters for the reference and sample beams. In the reference arm, we used, alternately, two collimated beams with diameters of 1.5 and 14 mm, respectively. In the sample arm, we tested collimated beams with the following diameters: 1.5, 3.5, 5.7, 8.4, and 14 mm. A galvanometric mirror system scanned the collimated sample beam across the entrance pupil of the telecentric system. The sample beam exited the telecentric system parallel with its optical axis and convergent onto the sample. Depending on the collimator used in the sample arm, images were acquired with beams focused to waist diameters ranging from 40 to 240 μm. We acquired images with the sample at different locations within a ±30 mm range centered about the sample beam waist. Furthermore, we used the signal-to-noise ratio, the detected signal intensity, and the visual appearance to compare images acquired with different sample/reference beam configurations.",[],[]
"We numerically investigate the performance of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) recognition using a time delay reservoir computing (TDRC) system consist of a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) subjected to optical feedback. A database of 960 images from 12 CHM categories is used to evaluate the recognition performance, most of which contain many CHM samples and have different backgrounds. The CHM image feature vector is masked and optically injected into the VCSEL, and the VCSEL output in two polarization modes are sampled as the virtual node states for readout. After testing the CHM recognition performance of TDRC under injecting the same information into two polarization modes of the VCSEL, we further test the performance of parallel processing by injecting half of the image information into each of the two polarization modes. By concatenating the virtual node states collected from two modes for readout, the recognition speed is doubled. Meanwhile, the influence of key parameters on recognition performance are investigated and the relationship between system idle state and recognition performance is also examined. The results show that, under parallel processing and orthogonal optical feedback, the TDRC achieves the minimum recognition error of 1.7% at a reservoir processing rate of 2 × 10 9 images per second.",[],[]
"A new type of circular Airy beam based on a bandpass filter is demonstrated to achieve further enhancement of field intensity at focal point, since the redundant rings without contribution to the focal point are suppressed via the bandpass filter. The enhancement effect can be tuned via the central spatial frequency, apodization steepness and width of bandpass filter. The results may find applications on optical manipulation since the enhanced field intensity gives a very strong gradient force.",[],[]
"Recent salient object detection methods are mainly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Most of them adopt a U-shape architecture to extract and fuse multi-scale features. The coarser-level semantic information is progressively transmitted to finer-level layers through continuous upsampling operations, and the coarsest-level features will be diluted, resulting in the salient object boundary being blurred. On the other hand, the hand-craft feature has the advantage of being purposive and easy to calculate, in which the edge density feature may help improve the sharpness of the salient object boundary by the rich edge information. In this paper, we propose a Co-Guided Attention Network (CoGANet). On the base of the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), our model implements a co-guided attention mechanism between the image itself and its edge density feature. In the bottom-up pathway of FPN, two streams separately work, taking the original image and its edge density feature as inputs, and each producing five feature maps. Then the last feature map in each stream generates a set of attention maps through a Multi-scale Spatial Attention Module (MSAM). In the top-down pathway, the attention maps of one stream are directly delivered to each stage in the other stream. These attention maps are fused with the feature maps by an Attention-based Feature Fusion Module (AFFM). Finally, an accurate saliency map is produced by fusing the finest-level outputs of the two streams. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate our model is superior to 13 state-of-the-art methods in terms of four evaluation metrics.",[],[]

"The existing approach for evaluating the statistical characteristics of speckle intensity distribution is applicable only to completely decorrelated laser beams. In the current study, a theoretical method based on a coherent matrix is developed for evaluating the first-order speckle statistics of partially correlated beams. A rigorous analytical formula for the calculation of speckle contrast is obtained based on the proposed coherent matrix method. Subsequently, an approximate analysis model of the speckle intensity distribution in a laser spot illuminated by partially correlated beams is proposed. The simulation results show that the accuracy of the approximate analysis model increases with the number of beams and is acceptable for practical application, even for a small number of beams. Applications of the proposed method are presented for analyzing two different optical schemes for speckle suppression. It is shown that the developed theoretical method is straightforward and effective for the analysis of light intensity statistics of laser spots illuminated by partially correlated beams. Therefore, the developed method can be easily generalized to imaging systems with partially correlated laser beams for evaluating the speckle intensity statistics.","['Laser beams', 'Speckle', 'Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions', 'Adaptive optics', 'Optical imaging', 'Laser theory', 'Laser noise']","['Coherent matrix', 'first-order speckle intensity statistics', 'hadamard matrix', 'partially correlated laser beams']"

"The 2 µm waveband is capable of enabling pervasive applications. The demonstration of the hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber and the thulium-doped fiber amplifier has highlighted the fiber propagation and amplification aspects of fiber communications, indicating its potential as an adjunct to present communication infrastructure at the O/C bands. The above is especially imperative given the current concerns with regards to the upper bandwidth limit of the single-mode fiber. Furthermore, the waveband could facilitate many more applications such as LIDAR and free-space communication. However, water absorption (OH - ) is high at most of the 2 μm waveband and this will impact the optical insertion loss of applications implemented in the wavelength region. The relative low water absorption region of the waveband falls within 1950 – 2000 nm. As such, the development of a hybrid/heterogeneous III-V/silicon laser source that operates within the region is important for 2 µm silicon photonics. In this work, we demonstrate a III-V/Si hybrid tunable laser operating from 1955 - 1992 nm for the first time.

"Short reach optical communications are desperate for cost-effective solutions to improve capacity and compatibility in dealing with massive access and applications. Single sideband-direct detection (SSB-DD) is highly recognized for improving capacity with single PD, but it is confronted with signal-signal beating interference (SSBI). Recently, a DC-Value method has been proposed for optical signal phase retrieval for single carrier signal transmission. To further explore the effectiveness and compatibility of DC-Value method, in this letter for the first time, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based multi-carrier modulation formats are processed by the DC-Value method in the receiver. Simulation results demonstrate that, for both OFDM and Nyquist-shaped single carrier (SC), the DC-Value method is beneficial in applying lower sampling rate to achieve comparable transmission performance than that of Kramers-Kronig receiver. In addition, althrough OFDM holds 2 dB increment of the optimum carrier-signal power ratio (CSPR) than Nyquist-SC, it offers more robustness to fibre transmission.",[],[]

Here, we conduct an experimental demonstration of the athermal effect in a microbubble resonator, employing an aluminum (Al) holder for its mounting. By converting the thermal expansion of the holder into controlled geometry adjustments in the microbubble resonator, we achieve athermal optical modes at a specific temperature. The athermal compensation is accomplished by counterbalancing the pulling force resulting from the thermal expansion of the Al holder against the thermal characteristics of the material, specifically SiO 2 . Especially, the optical modes located around the equator are particularly susceptible to the influence of the pulling force exerted by the Al holder. This temperature-insensitive feature of the resonance establishes a new avenue towards athermal microresonator through this special structure.",[],[]
"In this study, we reported a complex-signal-based optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) method, called complex correlated phase gradient variance (CCPGV), for mapping high-quality microvascular images. The performance of the newly proposed algorithm is benchmarked against the previously reported phase-resolved Doppler variance, complex differential variance (CDV), and split-spectrum amplitude and phase-gradient angiography (SSAPGA), by both tissue phantoms experiments and in vivo human skin measurements. Compared to the phase-resolved Doppler variance, CCPGV can intrinsically reject undesirable phase shifts caused by bulk motion and trigger jitter. In contrast to CDV and SSAPGA, which are insensitive to phase instability, CCPGV can provide superior motion contrast, as demonstrated by ∼1.4 and 3 times higher contrast in phantom experiments respectively. An increase of 27.3% and 106.3% were found in vivo experiments for CCPGV, making it easier to distinguish vessels from the background static. Benefiting from the advantages, more vessels and better connectivity can be visualized in the en -face angiogram processed by the CCPGV method.

"Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) of light has attracted enormous interest for its potential applications in controlling light at nanoscale and holds promise for future optical information technology and optoelectronics. In particular, the transverse spin in evanescent waves is regarded as distinct manifestation of SOI and an emerging candidate for miniaturizing optoelectronic circuits.

"Digital holography is a promising candidate for advanced display, although several obstacles remain, such as the problem of heavy time consumption in the generation of phase-only holograms. Recently, deep-learning-based methods have achieved the real-time generation of holograms while maintaining high image quality. However, the holograms created with deep neural networks can reproduce images only at a specific distance because their target depth is fixed in the training process. This paper suggested and demonstrated a deep neural network that can continuously control the depth of the phase-only hologram. The network takes a target depth and an input image and generates a phase-only hologram. We added a depth embedding block that moves the hologram latent vector depending on the target depth. Thus, we can change the location of the image plane without retraining. The numerical and optical experiments show that the network understands the relationship between the depth and the appearance of the phase-only hologram. As a result, phase-only holograms generated with the proposed network can reconstruct images with around 25-dB PSNR.",[],[]

"High-resolution optical spectroscopy is a significant approach to reveal the inherent laws of devices and systems. Although optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) based on stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) has achieved a resolution of ∼10pm, when the signal power increases, the Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) will saturate and cause resolution degradation. In order to solve this problem, we introduce shape factor k to describe the variation of BGS with signal power, and adopt the BGS as the point spread function (PSF). Then the signal is divided into several intervals with equal frequency spacing, where the BGS does not change. On this basis, we perform the Jansson-Van Cittert (JVC) algorithm to complete deconvolution in each interval with power variable PSF.

"The radially polarized beams are modulated by phase-type optical needle modulators can be tightly focused to create needle-like focused beams, which are called optical needles. The use of optical needles with different resolutions and focal depths as direct writing heads for laser direct lithography enables periodic, cross-scale processing of high aspect ratio micro-nano structures with different line widths. The design of the phase-type optical needle modulators is the key to obtain optical needles with different resolutions and focal depths.

"Low polarization-dependent semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) with an easy fabrication process and the capability to be co-integrated with passive elements are crucial in photonic integrated circuits. In this work, we design, simulate, and optimize a low polarization-dependent bulk SOA based on a novel layerstack with an unstrained bulk active layer with a robust and easy fabrication process that allows the co-integration with passive waveguides. The designed layerstack shows that the reflection between SOA and the passive waveguide is less than 1.3 × 10 −5 . Furthermore, by designing the ridge waveguide and layerstack (thickness of the core and cladding layers), the confinement factor of TE- and TM- modes (Г TE / TM ) are engineered to be approximately the same. This results in a low polarization-dependent SOA (since for the active bulk layer, the material gain of TE-mode is very close to the material gain of TM-mode). Numerical assessment of different length SOAs in terms of gain, polarization-dependent gain (PDG), noise figure are extensively investigated. Moreover, a booster SOA (1100 μm) with higher output saturation power has been investigated by widening the width of SOA from 1 μm to 3 μm. The output saturation power at 10 kA/cm 2 increases from +7.6 dBm to +13.9 dBm, when the width of the SOA waveguide increases from 1 μm to 3 μm.

The process of recovering F-P cavity corresponds with the sparse part of the signal, which takes advantage of the unique characteristics of interference fringes in this part. Moreover, the relationship between the relative change of the F-P cavity length and pneumatic pressure, as well as the relationship between the duration of the relative change of the F-P cavity length and the frequency are analyzed comprehensively. The rationality of the proposed demodulation scheme is verified from the angle-error analyses. These analyses could be helpful for integrated and high-frequency response pneumatic detection.",[],[]

However, the performance gap is decreasing with the increase of receiving power, especially when there is an interfering user. At the receiving power −2.8 dBm, two-user AF and DF relaying FSO-CDMA systems have almost the same BER. Under both weak and moderate turbulence conditions, at the receiving power −2.8 dBm, the measured BER of the eavesdropper exceeds 0.1, which is larger than the BER threshold of soft-decision forward error correction code. Hence, physical layer security of FSO relaying system can be achieved by optical coding.",[],[]

Finally, an integrating sphere uniform light system with high energy transmission efficiency and uniformity is designed and simulated with LightTools software. The simulation results show that: the average difference of irradiation uniformity and the range difference of irradiation uniformity are closest to 1 in the area where the ratio of the opening size and radius of the integrating sphere is 36%–40%, and the light is evenly distributed; When the baffle position is 0.8 times of integrating sphere radius away from the light entrance hole, irradiation non-uniformity at the outlet hole is 1.99%, which is the best position of the baffle; In the effective irradiation surface of Φ1032 mm, the irradiation non-uniformity is 1.98%, and the maximum irradiance is 0.62 solar constants, the spot simulation with high irradiation uniformity on large irradiation surface is realized.",[],[]

"The precise luminous intensity control for liquid crystal display (LCD) backlight units is an important issue that has not been well addressed in current research. A proper luminous intensity distribution can significantly enhance the viewing experience. In this paper, we propose a method for designing a freeform micro lens array that is capable of producing a prescribed luminous intensity distribution for direct-lit LED backlight module. As the luminous intensity distribution is usually need to be constrained within a quadrilateral pyramid region, a special coordinate system is developed by scanning two semicircles containing light rays along the X axis and Y axis to provide a flexible model for luminous intensity tailoring. Further, we convert the luminous intensity design problem to a specific illuminance problem by using a lossless energy conversion strategy.

"With the development of electric vehicles, indoor driving robots, wearable devices, etc., research on technology for recognizing one's current location continues to progress. Self-localization is an essential need for autonomous driving and mainly requires global positioning system (GPS), thereby using technologies such as LiDAR, Wi-Fi, and visible light communication (VLC). However, GPS is greatly affected by its surrounding environment, and it can make errors, especially in spaces where signals are blocked, such as tunnels and buildings. In this paper, we propose a system for estimating one's location using LED lights and frequency components with different color temperatures in an indoor space such as a tunnel. We installed three types of LED lights with different color temperatures in a tunnel-like experimental environment and collected data using RGB sensors.

"Fluorescence immunochromatographic assay (FICA) is a quantitative detection technique widely used in clinical diagnosis, environmental monitoring, and food safety. To deal with the limited applications caused by insufficient detection range, this paper proposes a photoelectric adjustment system suitable for FICA strip readers to expand its detection range. The photoelectric adjustment system is proposed based on the relationship between the excitation light intensity and the fluorescence intensity, which provides the optimal excitation light intensity and a stable baseline amplitude for the FICA strip reader.

"We propose a two-level dimmer based on binary distribution matching where a low-rate signal controls the output probability distribution of a high-rate bit sequence, which can be used in region-of-interest (RoI) signaling applications. To reduce the rate loss of the dimmer, we propose the extended multiset-partition distribution matching (EMPDM) algorithm with a novel binary-tree-structure implementation. In addition, we introduce 4p-EMPDM, a compact version of EMPDM, which has a typical composition (TC) and four leading composition pairs (CPs). The codebook of 4p-EMPDM includes only run-length-aware codewords, which reduces the maximum run-length of the transmitted bit sequence by 4.27 times. Hence, it guarantees flicker mitigation for visible-light RoI signaling systems at 6 kHz without using any run-length limited code (non-RLL). Using experimental data collected from the low-rate RoI signaling prototype, we introduced a threshold range where both intensity and area information of the received training symbols can be exploited to optimize the shaping ratios of the 4p-EMPDM dimmer. Because of the non-RLL feature, the proposed system can support soft-decision forward-error-correction (FEC) decoding to improve reliability.

"We theoretically investigate dynamics of dark pulse and Raman-Kerr microcombs generation influenced by higher-order effects, including high-order dispersion (HOD), stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and self-steepening (SS) effects in silicon microresonators. These three effects cause the delay of dark pulse individually, or interact with each other to alter the drift velocity and direction of pulses. HOD effect can change pulse shift direction and even cause bifurcation. The temporal drift induced by SS or SRS effects could be balanced by the simultaneous third-order dispersion (TOD) engineering. In spectral domain, stable Raman-Kerr frequency comb will be generated due to the competition between strong SRS and Kerr effects. The Raman comb components are suppressed when HOD effect coexists, while SS effect has ignorable effect on the distribution of the Raman comb. Furthermore, the SS effect will increase the total energy of the spectrum by shifting the dispersive wave (DW) generation to the longer wavelength side.

"Diffractive optical element (DOE) array promises compact shape for full-parallax integral imaging three-dimensional (3D) display. However, DOEs suffer from large chromatic aberration due to the strong wavelength-dependent nature of diffraction phenomena that degrade the quality of reconstructed 3D images. An end-to-end DOE optimization approach is proposed to reduce chromatic aberration for integral imaging. The end-to-end optimization framework includes RGB pre-processing convolutional neural networks and achromatic optics optimization design of rotationally symmetric DOE. An optical display model based on diffractive optics is proposed to analyze the integral imaging 3D display process for achromatic optical optimization design. The pre-processed elemental image arrays are modulated by an optimized DOE array to reconstruct the achromatic 3D images. A 3D artifacts scene without chromatic aberration is reconstructed in different views with the proposed method, and both peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) are improved compared to the conventional Fresnel lens DOE.",[],[]
"To figure out the energy attenuation of micro/nanofibers (MNFs) more flexibly and conveniently, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) is proposed to forecast the output intensity of rhodamine B (RhB) doped polymer microfibers (PMFs). According to the diameter, doping concentration, and propagation distance ( L ), we realize the L -dependence of output energy predictions for the excitation light ( IE ) and fluorescence ( IF ) of the doped PMFs. Hundreds of propagation distance-intensity data pairs acquired from dozens of RhB doped PMFs are used for the BPNN training. The prediction ability of the model is evaluated by the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and R 2 . The output intensity prediction performance of BPNN is compared with the traditional exponential-fitting (EF) method. The prediction results indicate that the two-hidden-layer network with one and seventeen neurons respectively provides the best performance. After training, BPNN gives a good intensity prediction for both the I E (RMSE = 3.16×10 −2 , MAPE = 7.3%, and R 2 = 0.9802) and the I F (RMSE = 0.91×10 −2 , MAPE = 0.89%, and R 2 = 0.9696) from the output end of the PMF with different diameters and doping concentrations. The energy losses of the two kinds of light from different doped PMFs are also calculated based on the predicted values, which are similar to the ones obtained from the EF method. The approach based on the BPNN prediction for the energy attenuation of the PMFs shows superiority in flexibility and applicability toward the traditional methods, which could promote the optimal design of the MNF devices and the practical application.",[],[]
"All-optical control of silicon photonic devices plays a key role in on-chip all-optical computing, switching and signal processing. However, due to the weak intrinsic nonlinear effects of silicon, current integrated devices are limited by high power consumptions. Here, an all-optical controllable optomechanical microring resonator (OMMR) is proposed and fabricated on the silicon platform. Due to the mechanical Kerr effect induced by the optical gradient force (OGF), we realize seamless wavelength tuning over a range of 2.56 nm which is 61% of the free-spectral range, with a high tuning efficiency of 80 GHz/mW. By controlling the pump power, the OMMR indicates three working regions, which are the cutoff region, amplified region and saturate region. Accordingly, this function is similar to a transistor. Furthermore, the dynamic properties of the OMMR are investigated. By analyzing the dynamic responses, we demonstrate that the OMMR is driven by the OGF, rather than other nonlinear effects. The method simplifies the experimental setup, compared with measuring the intrinsic mechanical frequency of the OMMR. This all-silicon device is energy-efficient and compatible with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processing. We believe that this work is important for on-chip all-optial signal processing and beneficial to futher studies on integrated optomechanics.",[],[]

In this work, we propose a high-contrast-gratings-like absorber to achieve ultra-high absorption based on a thin Germanium layer. High absorption approximately 95% at wavelength 1310 nm is reached for TE-polarized incidence due to the interference of two guided modes, which is 4 times compared to the planar film with the same thickness.

"Reducing carrier leakage is the key to obtain laterally coupled distributed feedback (DFB) lasers with high injection efficiency. We proposed a device structure with slots fabricated between the ridge and gratings to form a good confinement on carriers.

To evaluate the dependence of coupling efficient on main structural parameters, four grating samples with different sizes are studied with FDTD Solutions. Calculation results indicate that slots with a width of0.1−0.3μmis suitable for the device. And, changing the lateral width of the grating can be used as a direct method to adjust the coupling strength. In addition, the carrier distribution and optical field distribution of the device were simulated with Crosslight PICS3D, and the results show that compared with the traditional laterally-coupled gratings, this structure can strengthen the competitive advantage of fundamental mode and enhance the mode discrimination of the device. This structural design provides ideas and references for improving the injection efficiency and mode stability of laterally-coupled DFB lasers.",[],[]

"The stabilization and tracking performance of an image-based tip-tilt system is usually deteriorated by tip-tilt vibrations and beam jitter in optical links due to a limited tip-tilt correction bandwidth. This paper proposes an enhanced observer-based repetitive control (OBRC) method to break the bandwidth limitation of the time delay tip-tilt stabilized loop, which achieves high-frequency disturbance rejections beyond control bandwidth even up to Nyquist frequency. The enhanced repetitive controller is fused with the optimized observer based on Youla parameterization, which improves the stability of the closed-loop and reduces the waterbed effect in non-repetitive frequency. Furthermore, the time delay of the closed-loop system could be compensated by the OBRC. Therefore, disturbance suppressions can be transformed into the design of a repetitive controller, which is effective and easy to be used for tip-tilt vibrations and beam jitter suppression. Finally, simulation and experimental results show that the OBRC effectively suppresses the high-frequency disturbance beyond the control bandwidth of the optical-stabilized system.",[],[]

Here, we theoretically analyse the effect of vector vortex beams propagation through strongly anisotropic metamaterials exhibiting epsilon-near-zero behaviour. The interaction of the metamaterial with longitudinal field of the vector beams results in a strong modification of the polarisation distribution, with the metamaterial acting as an azimuthal polariser. The dependence on the local ellipticity of the field is also investigated revealing conversion of spin angular momentum to orbital angular momentum and polarisation structure vorticity, mediated by the longitudinal field.

"Chirality plays a pivotal role in the interaction between light and matter, yet detecting chiral signals from natural materials remains a challenge, necessitating the enhancement of their intensity. In this study, we present an approach to investigate substrate chirality through exploiting light scattering from Mie particles. To comprehensively analyze the scattering phenomenon, we theoretically derive the T-matrix for a nonchiral Mie sphere positioned on a chiral substrate. Unlike the Mie sphere in free space, our derivation accounts for the intricate coupling between the scattered light by the sphere and the reflected light by the substrate. Employing the T-matrix framework, we calculate the scattering power and circular dichroism spectra. Our findings reveal a remarkable augmentation of chiral signals originating from the substrate, thanks to the Mie resonance within high-index spheres. This research underscores the feasibility of probing local chiral properties in the vicinity of a sample surface, promising new insights into chiral interactions at the nanoscale.",[],[]
"The lower luminous efficiency is a critical issue for ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) owing to the poor carrier injection efficiency and high dislocation density. Here, we can improve the luminous efficiency in two avenues by adjusting the Al composition of the InGaN/Al x Ga 1-x N pre-well superlattice. First, due to the strain-induced piezoelectric and intrinsic spontaneous polarization, a large number of electrons gather at the InGaN/Al x Ga 1-x N interface, which improves the electron concentration of the pre-well superlattice and lowers the conduction band energy of the first quantum barrier layer (FQB), thus enhancing the electron injection efficiency. Second, the pre-well superlattice can act as a hole blocking layer to prevent holes from leaking into the n-type layer and confine them in the quantum well layer. As the Al composition increases, the hole blocking effect of the pre-well superlattice is strengthened. However, higher Al composition decreases the lattice quality, which makes it possible for carrier loss through defect-related non-radiative recombination. Finally, the output power of the samples with 5% Al composition in the pre-well superlattice is 5.9% and 102.5% higher than that of the samples with 3% and 7% Al composition, respectively.",[],[]
"Coherent diffraction microscopy (CDM) is a potential approach to image micromaterials at atomic resolution without crystals. Due to the lack of high-angle scattering, the achieved resolution is limited to several nanometers. Small-angle scattering allows researchers to reveal high-resolution 3D structures of specimens by fitting 1D diffraction signals. However, prerequisite 3D models and non-unique solutions restrict the potential to image general specimens. Under the assumption of an ensemble containing large amounts of identical specimens with the same orientation, the intensity distribution of the diffraction pattern of the whole ensemble is approximated to the form factor of a single specimen multiplied by the number of identical specimens. Since the diffraction intensities are contributed from the whole ensemble, the signal can be significantly extended to high-frequency regions. The feasibility of ensemble diffraction microscopy (EDM) was demonstrated by a designed sample using both totally and partially coherent X-ray sources at Taiwan Photon Source (TPS). The reconstructed images show excellent consistency with the image of a scanning electron microscope. This work represents a new protocol for directly characterizing the structures of nanomaterials, or potentially biomacromolecules, from accumulated X-ray scattering data.",[],[]
"The amplification protocol of single-photon is an effective method to overcome the photon loss in the practical quantum communication.

The uniformity of the illumination circle area on the target illumination surface is close to 86%.",[],[]
"The Degree of Polarization (DoP) of a light beam inside a medium contains unique information about the medium. 3D imaging techniques constitute an optimal procedure for determining the DoP under low light conditions, as the computational reconstruction process can increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected light. The definition of the DoP contains a division by the total number of detected photons from the sensor. However, under photon starved conditions, the number of detected photons at a single time period may be equal to zero. This may pose a division by zero problem for the computation of DoP. In this work, we consider a truncated Poisson distribution to overcome this problem and show that the mean value of the computed DoP goes to zero independently of the state of polarization of the light. The validity of our approach is verified by capturing the light fields of a test object to compute its DoP under low light conditions. The formulae derived in this work can be used to correct the deviation of the mean value of the DoP with respect to the ideal measurements.",[],[]
"Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) optical wireless communication systems are potential candidates for high-speed data transmission in indoor environments. In this work, we present an experimental evaluation of two different MIMO systems, i.e., conventional-MIMO (c-MIMO) and imaging-MIMO (i-MIMO) in terms of design considerations. Both systems use the same transmitter configuration featuring a one-dimensional (light-emitting diode) LED transmitting array. On the receiver side, the c-MIMO system employs a similar one-dimensional receiving avalanche photodetector (APD)-based array, whereas the i-MIMO system uses a customized imaging camera-based receiver design. To assess the performance of the two systems, the channel matrix and the bit-error rate are calculated based on the experimental data. At distances shorter than 50 m, the proposed c-MIMO system demonstrates a good transmission performance, particularly when the maximum likelihood detection (MLD) technique is applied. Whereas, at long distances ranging from 40 m to 65 m, the proposed i-MIMO system can ensure an error-free transmission due to the efficient spatial separation between the emitted optical beams. Furthermore, the experimental results confirm that our systems have the potential for high data rates over longer distances in indoor environments.",[],[]
"The compensation process for the state of polarization (SOP) from quantum signal plays an important role in the practical implementation of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). In contrast to the previous scheme using an expensive digital dynamic polarization controller, we choose a cheaper manual polarization controller interfaced with a digital algorithm based on Kalman filter to achieve compensation of the polarization loss under the condition that the SOP of the fiber is relatively stable. This paper also enumerates the details of other digital signal processing method to achieve final secret key rate. And a pilot-sequential Gaussian modulated coherent state (GMCS) continuous-variable quantum key distribution system with a local local oscillator (LLO) is experimentally implemented based on the analysis of excess noise.

"We experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, a method for arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) with time-bandwidth product (TBP) expansion beyond the limitations set by a spectral encoder. We show that, by using an anamorphic stretch transform with a specific group delay (GD) profile, one can boost the TBP of the generated electrical waveform in time-stretch AWG. In particular, we show that the TBP expansion can be achieved, depending on the signal sparsity and proper choice of the warped GD dispersion profile. The new waveform generation system is implemented here using a nonlinearly chirped fiber Bragg grating with a warped GD profile. Experimental demonstrations in this paper show a TBP expansion of more than three times above the maximum achievable using conventional methods.

"Mode instability (MI) has become a major factor that restricts the brightness enhancement of fiber laser. This paper studies the MI threshold characteristics of the fiber oscillators with refrigerated ytterbium-doped fiber (YDF). In the experiments, two fiber lasers that can operate at low temperature were built. We rigorously tested the MI threshold of the lasers with the YDF placed in two different environments. At room temperature environment, the MI threshold of the oscillator was measured with the temperature of the YDF water cooling plate ranging from 25 °C to 5 °C. When the cooling temperature of the YDF drops from 20 °C to 5 °C, the MI threshold of the laser rises gradually, but the increase is small. In another experiment, the YDF is assembled in a constant temperature test chamber, in which the cooling of the YDF is more efficient. It is found that as the cooling temperature drops, the MI threshold of the laser has an obvious upward trend. In the process of the cooling temperature of the YDF dropped from 20 °C to −10 °C, the MI threshold of the laser was increased from 867 W to above 931 W, an increase of nearly 10%. It is the first detailed experimental demonstration which shows that decreasing the cooling temperature of the gain fiber can indeed increase the MI threshold of the fiber oscillator. This work can clarify the influence of cooling temperature on the laser thermal effect, which is conducive to perfecting the theoretical model of the MI effect.",[],[]
"The thickness detection of quantum well has always been the research focus, especially for In x Ga 1-x As-based indium-rich cluster (IRC) structure, which has a thickness fluctuation of normal and indium-deficient InGaAs layers caused by IRC effect. In this paper, a simple and effective detection method for the special IRC structure is proposed by point-to-point acquisition. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra emitted from different In x Ga 1-x As positions are measured by moving the metal mask with a 0.2-mm-diameter light hole. By establishing the relationship between In x Ga 1-x As thickness and spectral intensity, the thickness fluctuation of normal In 0.17 Ga 0.83 As and indium-deficient In 0.12 Ga 0.88 As layers is determined by comparing the intensity of dual peaks. The dual peaks are typical feature of this IRC structure, which is caused by the migration of indium atoms.

"A recent discovery of super-Planckian radiation in the far-field has attracted a great deal of interest in thermal radiation control using photonic crystals (PC) architecture. The finding is based on a careful comparison of radiation intensity emitted from a PC nano-filament and a blackbody at the same temperature and same wavelength at λ∼1.7 μm. Extending that finding, we determined the absolute spectral radiance of such a PC filament at λ∼1.7 μm at elevated temperature, T = 445–723 ° K, and compared its value to that predicted by Planck's blackbody radiation law. Our data confirmed that the PC spectral radiance surpassed that of a blackbody by an order-of-magnitude. We also determined the spectral emissivity of our PC filament and showed that its value far exceeded unity at resonance and fell below unity away from resonance. The observation of non-equality between absorptivity and emissivity suggests that a strong optical non-reciprocity takes place in our PC nano-filament.",[],[]

"Optical camera communication (OCC) is a type of visible light communication that employs a camera as the receiver. Various flicker-free OCC methods using a general-purpose low-frame rate camera have been proposed. In particular, the undersampling method uses a short exposure camera and a light-emitting diode that blinks faster than the camera's frame rate. Despite the short exposure time, the transmitter has to send a symbol for a frame period or longer because the relationship between the symbol timing of the transmitter and exposure timing of the receiver is indeterminate. We propose resolving this indeterminacy by synchronizing the exposure timing to the transmitter. In the proposed method, the transmitter sends multiple data channels in a frame period by time division multiplexing, and the receiver selects a channel. Then, a single symbol of multilevel phase shift keying is extracted from a single pixel value in a frame. Experiments confirmed that the exposure timing could be synchronized even with a degraded signal–noise ratio and that the receiver could select the desired channel. The proposed method achieved a bit error rate of 10^{-6} at a signal–noise ratio of 46.2 dB under various modulation schemes.",[],[]
"Random numbers generated via quantum process is indeterministic, which are of essential to the cryptographic communication and the large-scale computer modeling. However, in realistic scenarios, classical noises can inevitably contaminate the raw sequences of a quantum randomness number generator (QRNG), and then compromise the security of the QRNG. Min-entropy is a useful approach that can quantify the randomness independent of side-information. To enhance the extractable randomness of the raw sequences arising from the QRNG, we propose a new method which exploits non-uniform quantization methods instead of uniform sampling methods and effectively enhances the extractable randomness from the QRNG at a high quantum-to-classical-noise ratio (QCNR). Given a QCNR as 50 dB and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), the worst-case conditional min-entropy of the non-uniform quantization scheme is improved by nearly 11% compared with that of the uniform sampling scheme.",[],[]

More importantly, it can work with very weak coupling coefficients, down to 10 −4 .",[],[]
"In edge-emitting high power laser diodes, the longitudinal spatial hole burning (LSHB) effect induced by the inhomogeneous photon and carrier distributions and the non-linear process, two-photon absorption (TPA), are demonstrated to the key causes of power saturation at the high injection level even in the absence of thermal roll-over. Laser diodes based on extreme, double/triple asymmetric (EDAS/ETAS) epitaxial structures show great potentials in high-power and high-efficiency applications owing to the reduced series resistance, low optical loss, and suppressed power saturation.

The Q-switched laser produced 9.1 W pulsed dual-wavelength output (4.7 W at 1064 nm and 4.4 W at 1079 nm) at 25-kHz pulse repetition rate with synchronized pulse duration of 35 ns, corresponding to the optical-to-optical efficiency of 30.3%. The continuous-wave (CW) output power reached 15.5 W at laser diode (LD) pump power of 40 W, corresponding to a slope efficiency of 40.9% and an optical-to-optical conversion efficiency of 38.9%. The powers at two wavelengths were almost equivalent and the fluctuations were both less than 2.3%. To our best knowledge, it was the highest output power for stable CW dual-wavelength lasers based on diode-end-pumped configuration.",[],[]
"Applications of lithium atoms, such as atom vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS), need high-power narrow-linewidth tunable lasers of 670 nm. Available commercial products, such as dye lasers, solid state lasers and semiconductor lasers, are all with no more than 1W-level average output power. Our aim is to achieve much higher power by MOPA method. The demonstrated CW 4.5W laser is a staged result. Highly integrated semiconductor laser chips and coherent combination will be the next plan.",[],[]

"We propose a high-resolution scheme for determining the kinetic parameters of sucrose hydrolysis based on the weak measurement, and the parameters including rate constant, half-life, activation energy and pre-exponential factor are experimentally determined. In the scheme, the postselection state of weak measurement is modified by the optical rotation angle in the process of sucrose hydrolysis, and the amplified spin-Hall shift acts as a probe for determining the kinetic parameters. The rate constant and half-life are obtained based on the time variations of amplified spin-Hall shifts under different reaction conditions of temperatures and hydrochloric acid concentrations. The corresponding activation energy and pre-exponential factor are also evaluated for explaining the physical mechanism which influences the rate constant and analyzing how to adjust the reaction conditions to predict or control the rate. The high resolution for optical rotation angle is achieved in our scheme, which can reach {\rm {4}}{\rm {.9}} \times {\rm {10}}^{\rm {-4}} degree with one order of magnitude improvement over the polarimeter. These results can provide a possibility for the determination of chemical kinetic parameters with high-precision, real-time, label-free and convenient effects.","['Kinetic theory', 'Sugar', 'Optical variables measurement', 'Chemicals', 'Monitoring', 'Rotation measurement', 'Optical sensors']","['Weak measurement', 'Spin-Hall shift', 'Kinetic parameter']"

"We propose a high-security hyperchaotic orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) encryption scheme based on the orbital angular momentum system, and our research focuses on the security and high-order modulation of the orbital angular momentum (OAM)system. In order to effectively prevent violent decryption by eavesdroppers, we adopt a high security Zhan's hyperchaotic model. In the experiments, the high security performance of the proposed encryption scheme is verified by the OAM optical transmission platform, the proposed encryption scheme has a large key space of 10 191 , and it is demonstrated that the high-order spatial optical modulation has a small impact on the bit error rate (BER) of the OAM system within the forward error correction (FEC) threshold. The experimental results show that the proposed encryption scheme significantly improves the security performance of OAM spatial optical transmission, and is a promising candidate for the next-generation high-security OAM high-order multiplexed transmission system.",[],[]
