"The dynamic refractive-index-change behavior of the light-induced process in an Mn:Fe:KTN crystal illuminated by a focused light sheet can be observed experimentally by digital holographic interferometry. By numerically retrieving a series of sequential phase maps from recording digital holograms, the spatial and temporal evolution of the light-induced refractive-index-change distribution inside the material is visualized in situ and monitored in a quantitative and in full field way. With this technique, the effect of recording parameters, such as writing laser power and polarization, bias voltage, temperature, and writing time, on the Mn:Fe:KTN crystal in the photorefractive effect can be explored. Therefore, optimized recording parameters will be achieved according to the dynamic behavior. The method provides an access to explore the evolution of the photorefractive (PR) effect of electrooptic crystal under various situations.","['Refractive index', 'Crystals', 'Writing', 'Optical interferometry', 'Laser beams', 'Temperature measurement', 'Holography']","['Mn:Fe:KTN crystal', 'photorefractive effect', 'digital holographic interferometry']"
"We experimentally investigate the wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) transmission of single-carrier 400G based on an orthogonal optical time-division multiplexed (orth-OTDM) 80-GBd polarization-division multiplexed (PDM) 8 quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) signal. The 80-GBd 8QAM signal is generated using the OTDM method based on two tributaries of time-domain orthogonal pulses with 40-GBd 8QAM signals. Full-band coherent detection is utilized with digital signal processing based on a single broadband receiver for the 80-GBd signals. The WDM transmission performance of single-carrier 400G signals within different channel grids and carrier spacing is also investigated. Finally, four 400G channels, each carrying an 80-GBd PDM-8QAM signal within 100-, 80-, and 75-GHz grids, are successfully transmitted over 1600-, 800-, and 400-km standard single-mode fibers with Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA)-only amplification below a pre-Forward error correction (FEC) bit-error rate (BER) of 2.4×10 -2 (20% soft-decision FEC), respectively.

"To track vital signs on the wrist, a wearable system, named WrisTee, has been developed for remote health monitoring. Using three optical sensors with four light sources, WrisTee allows users to measure 12 photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals at three locations on the radial artery. Two types of PPG signals with opposite polarities were discovered and designated as in-phase and invert-phase signals. We provided a unified viewpoint regarding their differences based on the Beer−Lambert law, and showed that both signals can be used for heart monitoring using data analyzed from a selected subject. Using reflective pulse-transition time (R-PTT) and the standard deviation of R-PTT (σR-PTT), we proposed a method for selecting the optimal wavelength to achieve the best quality signal, thus minimizing storage requirements, power resources, and computational costs. We conducted an experiment on ten subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. Our results demonstrated that WrisTee is capable of finding the optimal positions and wavelengths for monitoring vital signs. To automatically detect the PPG phases, six machine learning (ML) models were explored to assess their accuracy for PPG-phase classification. The experimental results show that a convolutional neural network can be the best candidate for phase classification. Hence, it can be integrated into WrisTee for noninvasive health monitoring such as heart rate, heart rate variability, or blood pressure. Our work paves a new direction in bio-signal medical researches by adopting in-phase and invert-phase PPGs for healthcare monitoring.","['Sensors', 'Optical sensors', 'Monitoring', 'Biomedical monitoring', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Wrist', 'Sensor arrays']","['Blood pressure', 'in-phase', 'invert-phase', 'machine learning', 'multi-wavelength', 'photoplethysmogrpahy', 'pulse transition time', 'vital signs', 'wearable']"

"An approach for wideband phase noise measurement of microwave signal sources is proposed based on all-optical microwave signal processing. In the proposed scheme, an optical carrier is sequentially modulated by the signal under test (SUT) in a phase modulator and a dual-polarization modulator to generate two +1st-order sidebands with orthogonal polarizations. A time delay is introduced between two sidebands by a span of low-loss optical fiber. Combined with a polarization controller and a polarizer, photonic microwave downconversion with a desired phase shift and time delay can be realized after photodetection, and the phase noise of the SUT can be calculated thereafter. Since all the microwave signal processing functions in the conventional photonic-delay-line-based phase noise measurement system are implemented in the optical domain, the proposed scheme has a large operational bandwidth and a high measurement sensitivity. In the experimental demonstration, accurate phase noise measurement of SUTs is achieved in a frequency range of 10-35 GHz, and a phase noise floor as low as −132.16 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz is obtained.","['Microwave measurement', 'Microwave photonics', 'Microwave theory and techniques', 'Phase noise', 'Optical variables measurement', 'Optical polarization', 'Phase measurement']","['All-optical microwave signal processing', 'frequency discriminator', 'microwave photonics', 'phase noise']"

"In monolithic photonic integrated circuits (PICs), an optimized active/passive integration is needed to provide efficient coupling and low amount of interface reflections between amplifiers and passive components. A 1300 nm semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) on InP substrate and optimized for butt-joint reflections is investigated. Material performance were assessed from measurements of broad area lasers. Room temperature operation reveals 1.2 W single facet output power with threshold current around 100 A/cm 2 per well. Characteristic temperatures of T 0 = 75 K and T 1 = 294 K were obtained. A compact model description of the SOA, suitable for the design of PICs and rate equation analysis, was applied to parametrize the unsaturated gain measurements. Current injection efficiency of 0.65, transparency carrier density of 0.57 10 18 cm −3 , and free carrier absorption losses up to 15 cm −1 were extracted from fitting the data. The model is verified with measurements of optical gain saturation. A modal gain of 15 dB for a 600 μm long narrow ridge SOA leads to output saturation power higher than 30 mW at 7 kA/cm 2 . This building block contributes to the development of an InP monolithic integration technology in the 1300 nm range, which can enable the use of photonic integrated circuits in many kind of applications.","['Semiconductor optical amplifiers', 'Optical waveguides', 'Indium phosphide', 'III-V semiconductor materials', 'Strain', 'Reflection', 'Optical reflection']","['InP', 'monolithic integrated circuits', 'o-band telecommunications', 'semiconductor optical amplifiers', 'semicondu- ctor device modeling']"

"In this paper, a novel two-dimensional (2D) generalized optical spatial modulation (GOSM) scheme is proposed for multiple-input multiple-output optical wireless communication (MIMO-OWC) systems. By grouping multiple successive time slots as one time block, 2D GOSM mapping can be performed not only in the space domain but also in the time domain. Specifically, two types of 2D GOSM mapping schemes are designed, including 2D-1 and 2D-2 GOSM mappings. Moreover, to address the high complexity issue of optimal joint maximum-likelihood (ML) detection and the noise amplification and error propagation issues of zero-forcing-based ML (ZF-ML) detection, a deep neural network (DNN)-aided detection scheme is further designed for 2D GOSM systems. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed 2D GOSM scheme with deep learning-aided detection for high-speed and low-complexity MIMO-OWC systems.

"The inter-data center links are meeting the challenge of increasing transmission capacity continuously. Here, the tradeoff between transmission capacity and cost and power consumption especially needs to be considered.

Each 4-f imaging system is capable of collimating and adaptively splitting an input optical beam emerging from an optical fiber and then coupling the split beams into different output fiber ports, thus realizing dynamic optical power splitting. The Opto-VLSI processor is driven by optimized multicasting phase holograms that adaptively split an incident laser beam along different angles; thus, user-defined splitting ratios can be achieved.

"Accurate probing, monitoring, and controlling the pH level is critical in different fields. In the last two decades, optical fiber/waveguide-based pH sensors have been widely investigated with the aim of further enhancement of sensitivity and miniaturization. Here, we propose a novel and cost-effective pH sensor based on polymer waveguide Bragg grating, addressing main aspects like sensitivity enhancement, miniaturization, narrow band response, and stable performance. The large evanescent field due to metal under cladding and high index coating combined with excellent penetration depth match with pH-sensitive polymer coating of poly-acrylic acid/poly-allylamine hydrochloride (PAA/PAH) in an aqueous medium, ensures a sensitivity of 10.4 nm/pH for a pH range of 4 to 7, two orders higher than all reported Bragg grating pH sensors to our knowledge. A narrow band (∼1 nm) response has been ensured by low propagation loss of the TE mode. Further, the variations in sensitivity and peak reflectivity are within 3% for a ±10% inaccuracy in various structural parameters, reflecting excellent fabrication tolerances. The proposed sensor is an important development, especially for the perishable food industry in which a high sensitivity in a pH range of 4 to 7 is highly desirable to accurately determine the freshness of foods.","['Sensitivity', 'Indexes', 'Polymers', 'Gratings', 'Reflectivity', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Couplings']","['Gratings', 'photonic crystal', 'sensors', 'waveguides']"

"Previously, when selecting silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for use in visible light communications (VLC) systems the bandwidth of the SiPM has been a high priority. However, results of experiments on VLC receivers containing two different sizes of commercially available SiPMs show that, if equalization is used and the OOK bit time is less than one third of the duration of its output pulses, the SiPMs bandwidth doesn't significantly impact the receiver's performance. Consequently, for these data rates the criteria used to select which SiPM to incorporate in VLC receivers should put a higher priority on their area and photon detection efficiency than on their bandwidth. In addition, for these data rates, unless the SiPM becomes non-linear, the performance of a receiver containing a SiPM can be predicted based upon Poisson statistics.","['Receivers', 'Photonics', 'Microcell networks', 'Bandwidth', 'Visible light communication', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Optical fibers']","['Optical wireless communications', 'silicon photomultiplier', 'visible light communications']"
"We propose a novel demodulation scheme based on measuring interference fringe visibility and demonstrate it using a typical Michelson interferometer (MI) configuration. The key component to achieve the scheme is a section of highly birefringent fiber (HBF) spliced into the sensing arm to function as the sensing element. The optical path difference (OPD) leads to interference fringes, while the birefringence of the HBF results in a visibility envelop. It is possible to detect measurands associated with birefringence through measuring the visibility, which is attributed to a flexible use of the fundamental principle of interferometry. As one of the potential applications, temperature sensing employing the MI configuration is performed. Moreover, the technique has the advantage of being immune to element instabilities, such as power fluctuation of the light source, phase shift of the reference arm, noise of the photo detector, and wavelength shift of the optical spectrum analyzer (OSA).

"A few mode fiber temperature sensor filled with PDMS based on vernier effect is proposed. It uses single mode fiber (SMF), few mode fiber (FMF), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to form the SMF-air microcavity-FMF-PDMS-FMF structure. It is to slot the glass capillary tube, place the two FMFs in the slot at a suitable distance, and fill the slot with PDMS multiple times and seal it. The PDMS is used as a sensing microcavity. We insert the SMF from the other end of the glass capillary tube, adjust the distance, fix the SMF and seal the connection. Two end faces of the SMF and the first FMF form an air reference microcavity. Since the refractive index of each medium is different, multiple reflective surfaces are formed to reflect. Because the second FMF is infinitely long, whose right end is beveled, it is considered that the sensor has four reflected beams. When the temperature changes, the length and refractive index of the PDMS microcavity will change, which will cause a change in the interference spectrum of the sensor. And because the vernier effect is formed by the superposition of the two microcavities, the temperature sensitivity can be amplified and the temperature can be measured with high sensitivity. The experimental results show that in the range of 40–56°C, the transmission spectrum of the sensor appears red shift with the increase of temperature, and the temperature sensitivity can reach 3.89nm/°C. The sensor is simple to manufacture, has high sensitivity, and has good application prospects.","['Sensors', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Temperature sensors', 'Optical fibers', 'Microcavities', 'Sagnac interferometers', 'Sensitivity']","['Fiber optics', 'Vernier effect', 'few mode fiber', 'temperature']"
"A layer-reduced neural network based digital backpropagation algorithm called smoothing learned digital backpropagation (smoothing-LDBP), is proposed in this paper. The smoothing-LDBP smooths the power terms in nonlinear activation functions to limit the bandwidth. The limited bandwidth of the power terms generates fewer in-band distortions, thus reduces the required layer for a given equalization performance. Simulation results show that the required layers of smoothing-LDBP are reduced by approximately 62% at 6.7% HD-FEC compared with learned digital backpropagation. Owing to the layer reduction, the latency and the complexity are reduced by 69% and 51%, respectively.

"The features of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as strong manoeuvrability, small size, and light weight, make them considered to participate in free space optical (FSO) quantum communication, becoming an important part of the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network. However, research reports on small-sized drones based long-range optical quantum link are few. A major challenge is that traditional opto-mechanical structure is difficult to adapt to small UAV platforms. Here, a lower size, weight, and power (SWaP) acquisition and tracking system prototype is developed, and its greatest advantage is that the system can be easily integrated into small flying platforms and quickly build a long-distance quantum communication link. The prototype weighs less than 8 kg. A small-sized two-axis mirror mechanism is designed for wide-range acquisition and tracking. Moreover, the system can automatically point to ground station. The SWaP acquisition and tracking system can support quantum key distribution (QKD) link and general FSO link by drones. In the 7 km air-to-ground demonstration, the acquisition and tracking system prototype is tested in practice, which is suspended under the small six-rotor UAV platform, and a special passive vibration isolation unit is added in between.

However, it adds to the difficulty of processing, testing, assembling, and adjusting, and at the same time has the drawbacks of high manufacturing costs and long processing cycles. In view of the above problems, this paper presents a computational imaging design method for expanding the Y field of view of an off-axis optical system. This method analyzes the aberration characteristics of the optical system, creates a point spread function model based on the wavefront aberration theory and Zernike polynomials, and processes images using a spatial variation deconvolution algorithm. In this paper, we used this method to simulate an off-axis three-mirror optical system with a focal length of 260 mm, the f-number of 2.5, and a field of view of 8° × 1° and compare the images before and after processing. The results show that the processed images have a clear outline, the overall image quality is improved, the field of view is improved to 8° × 6°, and the modulation transfer function of the entire field of view is above 0.4. The off-axis optical system rectangular field of view imaging is realized without using a freeform surface.","['Optical imaging', 'Adaptive optics', 'Optical diffraction', 'Optical surface waves', 'Optical reflection', 'Optical sensors', 'Imaging']","['Optical design', 'off-axis optical system', 'computational imaging', 'Point Spread Function (PSF)']"
"In this paper, a microstructured laser with modulated periodic microstructures for beam control is proposed for the first time. Lasers using modulated periodic microstructures can emit beam with lower vertical divergence angle for the same number of microstructures. And lasers with specific period length can transmit beam in specific direction. These lasers emitting beams with different emission directions can be integrated into an array. And this array can be used directly as a transmitter chip of LiDAR. Both simulation and experimental results show that the modulated periodic microstructures can effectively reduce the vertical divergence angle. In the experiment, the lowest vertical divergence angle of 0.88° and a large angle sweep range of 41.5° have been obtained. A horizontal divergence angle of 4.3° is achieved with the taper structure.

"A bandwidth-tunable multiband microwave photonic filter (MPF) using a strongly coupled microring resonator (MRR) with optical phase modulation is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally. Two notches of the MRR adjacent to the optical carrier break the intrinsic balance of the phase-modulated signal and then two sub-MPFs are formed thanks to the conversion from phase modulation to intensity modulation (PM-IM). The frequency responses of the two sub-MPFs are superimposed to form a passband with a fixed center frequency. Due to the periodicity of the MRR transmission spectrum, multiple passbands separated by a certain spacing appear in the frequency domain and combine to form a multiband MPF, whose bandwidth can be adjusted by tuning the wavelength of the carrier. The tunable bandwidth and shape factors ranging from 0.73 GHz to 2.73 GHz and 5.06 to 1.38 are experimentally performed. The number of passbands can be reconfigured.

"Nano antennas have a significant role in photonic nanodevices due to the ability of concentrating radiation in a small space region. The confined fields present a high sensitivity to the used materials in that regions. The electromagnetic wave models of nanoantennas usually operate in the frequency domain. However, electromagnetic wave models in the time domain are just as important and more advantageous, for example, in light pulses propagation. In this article, a new stochastic method based on the ray model of light in absorbing media is presented and light patterns on a target near a nanoantenna are obtained. The optical properties of the materials are described by their complex refractive index. When dealing with photons in the time domain, this formulation allows the calculation of the probability of a given photon movement. Different patterns, obtained with the new method, are compared with a Finite Element Tool ones, leading to model validation. The simulated structure included an aperture nanoantenna. With this method, the results show the light confinement and the extraordinary optical transmission phenomenon, meaning some photons on the target are refracted and re-transmitted by the metal. Thus, the output beam is more intense than the transmitted directly by the apertures.","['Photonics', 'Optical filters', 'Optical variables control', 'Optical surface waves', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical refraction', 'Nanoscale devices']","['Extraordinary optical transmission', 'light patterns', 'nano arrays', 'nano antennas', 'optical devices']"

"Mobility μ is essential in electronic and optoelectronic devices.

According to FF, there are three regions. When FF ≫ 1 and FF≪1, the carrier behavior follows the Fermi and Boltzmann distributions, respectively. When FF~1, the derived transition temperature of 282.4 K represents a transition point from Fermi to Boltzmann distribution, which is consistent with T c in the experiment.

"Recent research in Phase-Sensitive Optical Time Doman Reflectometry (ϕ-OTDR) has been focused, among others, on performing spatially resolved measurements with various methods including the use of frequency modulated probes.

The proposed method offers high fidelity chirped waveforms, and when employed in resolving a 50-cm event at ∼1.13 km using a 1.2-µs probe pulse, matched filtering with the DDS-generated NLFM waveform results in a significant reduction in range ambiguity owing to autocorrelation sidelobe suppression of ∼20 dB with no averages and windowing functions, for an improvement of ∼16 dB compared to conventional linear chirping. Experimental results also show that the contribution of autocorrelation sidelobes to the power in the compressed backscattering responses around localized events is suppressed by up to ∼18 dB when advanced pulse compression with an optical NLFM pulse is employed.","['Optical fiber sensors', 'Probes', 'Optical fibers', 'Frequency modulation', 'Frequency measurement', 'Optical pulse compression', 'Spatial resolution']","['Coherent effects', 'fiber nonlinear Optics', 'fiber optic systems', 'pulse compression', 'scattering']"

"A simple and all-optical Doppler frequency shift (DFS) measurement system is presented. It is based on a dual-drive Mach Zehnder modulator (DDMZM) driven by a transmitted signal and an echo signal received by an antenna. A low-frequency sawtooth wave is applied to the DDMZM DC port to frequency shift the carrier and sidebands generated by the transmitted signal. Beating of a frequency-shifted transmitted signal sideband and an echo signal sideband at the photodetector produces a low-frequency electrical signal.

"In this paper, we develop a set of effective algorithms for performing efficient and accurate visible light positioning (VLP) in the presence of shot noise, which is an important component in the received optical signal yet has been largely neglected in prior works. In particular, we formulate the positioning problem as a maximum log-likelihood optimization problem, which is nonconvex so that the standard numerical algorithm such as gradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) may not be able to find the global solution. To address this, we propose a novel least-square (LS) solver that can find a sub-optimal solution to the aforementioned non-convex optimization problem. Based on the LS solver, a set of more effective algorithms can be developed to further enhance the optimality of the solution. Specifically, we consider (1) combining the LS solver with GD, giving rise to the GD-LS algorithm; and (2) applying the LS solver in an iterative manner, giving rise to the iterative LS algorithm, which is a novel and efficient positioning algorithm. Moreover, we also provide a closed-form lower bound on the positioning error based on the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLB). Numerical simulation shows that the proposed GD-LS and iterative LS algorithms cannot only achieve high positioning accuracy, but also enjoy low computation complexity: the average positioning accuracy of LS-GD is 0.009 m using computation time 0.046 s, and the iterative LS algorithm can achieve average positioning accuracy 0.023 m with 1.94\times 10^{-4} s computation time, which outperform GD and SGD method.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Iterative algorithms', 'Visible light communication', 'Optical receivers', 'Optical transmitters', 'Wireless communication', 'Thermal noise']","['Visible light positioning', 'gradient descent', 'least square', 'CRLB']"

"Time delay signature (TDS) is a key issue that affects the security performance of optical chaos communication. Currently, the autocorrelation function (ACF) and delayed mutual information (DMI) are two crucial methods to extract the TDS. Several strategies have been proposed to resist statistical analysis (i.e., ACF and DMI). However, a dynamic inverse modeling method has been proposed to identify TDS by utilizing the strong nonlinear inversion capability of deep learning, which brings about new threat. To resist this analysis, we propose a stratagem that one can increase the nonlinear dimensionality of the chaos system at the transmitter and concurrently reduce the dimensionality of transmitted signals, leading to “deficiency of data dimensionality”. A three-dimensional chaotic system is designed as the transmitter and only one-dimensional signal is transmitted for communication. Furthermore, a hybrid receiver is designed. The nonlinear model of the response system is realized by cooperation of an analog electro-optical link and a neural network in digital domain. The architecture not only destroys the possibility of TDS extraction but also preserves all necessary information required for chaos synchronization with low-complexity implementation.","['Chaos', 'Synchronization', 'Optical transmitters', 'Security', 'Optical receivers', 'Delay effects', 'Chaotic communication']","['Physical layer security', 'time delay concealment', 'deep learning']"

"Star sensor needs real-time calibration to improve its navigation accuracy. Compared with other parameters, the position of the principal point is more easily affected by the measurement error, which leads to low calibration accuracy. Conventional star sensors on-orbit calibration methods mainly rely on the angular distance(AD) between stars. The observability of the principal point in this method and the calibration accuracy is not as well as that of other parameters. In this paper, an on-orbit calibration method of star sensor based on the angular distance subtraction(ADS) is proposed. The accuracy of the on-orbit calibration is improved by increasing the observability of the principal point in the calibration process, and the feasibility of this method is verified by the observability analysis. Finally, improved angular distance subtraction(IADS) models are proposed to solve the time-consuming problem of ADS method. In order to demonstrate the performance of the IADS models, simulation calibrations are conducted. The results show that the accuracy of u0 and v0 of the IADS method is 62.7% and 15.9% higher than that of AD method when other parameters are set as nominal values.

The MPF, which is composed by a broadband optical source, an inline interferometer based on a variable optical delay line (VODL), an intensity modulator, and a dispersive element, serves as an oscillating mode selector. The oscillation frequency can be tuned by changing the differential time delay via the VODL. Due to the non-carrier-suppression effect of the selector, the oscillator can generate transmission-null-free microwave signal with widely tunable frequency range. An experiment is performed, and a tunable frequency range of 6.8 GHz is achieved.

"The resonance characteristics of the micro-coil resonator(MCR) with different turns and coupling conditions are presented, which show that the effective length of the MCR with small coupling coefficient at primary resonant is independent of the turns, and the resonance dips always appear in pairs corresponding to multiple critical-coupling because of the periodicity of coupling strength. However, complicated resonance is observed in an MCR with larger coupling coefficient and turns. The superluminal or subluminal propagation regime can be obtained respectively by adjusting the coupling condition, and the effect of loss on them in different coupling conditions is investigated. There is such a loss threshold in the critical-coupling and over-coupling conditions, near which the group refractive index abrupt changes between positive and negative extremum, and the threshold is increased by 10 5 orders of magnitude under over-coupling condition compared with critical-coupling. In view of the transmission near a resonant evolve not only with the detuning of transmission phase, but also drastically with the adjustment of coupling condition which will be modulated by the cladding refractive index and coupling length.

However, previous work has shown that machine learning models such as Gaussian processes (GP) achieve better performance and are more robust in general, particularly in presence of non-ideal environmental conditions.

"The Kerr self-focusing and group-velocity dispersion (GVD) effects play important roles when a high-power pulsed laser beam propagates from the ground through the nonlinear and dispersive atmosphere to space orbits. For an annular pulsed laser beam, the Kerr self-focusing and GVD effects on the beam quality on the target is studied in this paper. Due to self-focusing, the maximum intensity I max on the target arrives when the beam power P = P opt ( P opt is called the optimal beam power), and the intensity on the target will decrease as the beam power P increases further when P > P opt . The P opt of nanosecond and picosecond pulsed beams is lower than that of femtosecond pulsed beams, while the maximum intensity I max on the target of nanosecond and picosecond pulsed beams is higher than that of femtosecond pulsed beams. The P opt and I max of annular pulsed beams are higher than those of Gaussian pulsed beams. In addition, the B integral and the Strehl ratio are also adopted to describe the beam quality on the target. On the other hand, because of the interplay of Kerr self-focusing and GVD effects, the temporal pulse splitting and self-healing may take place on propagation, and the temporal pulse splitting may take place more than once.

"Distinct temperature-dependent dynamic behaviors of GaN-based blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are observed by use of the very-fast electrical-optical pump-probe technique. Our static and impulse response measurement results indicate that the behaviors of internal carrier dynamics under different ambient temperatures can be classified into three regimes covering a wide range of bias current densities (20-2000 A/cm 2 ). The first regime is when the bias current density ranges from low to moderate (20-100 A/cm 2 ). The measured external quantum efficiency (EQE) degrades dramatically from 57 to 44%, and the measured waveform and extracted time constants of measured impulse responses are invariable from room temperature (RT) to 200 °C, which indicates that the carrier leakage is not an issue for the observed droop phenomenon. When the bias current density further increases to near 1 kA/cm 2 , the droop phenomenon are mitigated (44 to 24%). However, a significant shortening of the measured impulse response happens under 200 °C operation due to the device-heating effect. This phenomenon is diminished when the bias current densities are further increased to over 1 kA/cm 2 , due to the screening of the piezoelectric field. The extracted time constants can also be used to explain the droop phenomenon in GaN LED under high bias currents.","['Temperature measurement', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Current density', 'Gallium nitride', 'Power measurement', 'Quantum well devices']",['Light-emitting diodes (LEDs)']

"Fast active quenching of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) is important to reduce the afterpulsing probability (APP). An option to reduce the reaction time of electronics to a SPAD's avalanche is to design a quencher exploiting bipolar transistors. A quencher in a 0.35 μm CMOS technology with a nominal supply voltage of 3.3 V, which operated with excess bias voltages up to 6.6 V, was re-designed accordingly. In the new 0.35 μm pure-silicon BiCMOS quencher, the comparator takes advantage of a bipolar differential amplifier, which additionally gives the head room to increase the width of some CMOS transistors as well. The proposed BiCMOS quencher is able to drive the load of a wire-bonded 184 μm-diameter SPAD, while the CMOS design fails. A comparison, where both chips are measured with a wire-bonded, 34 μm-diameter SPAD, shows that the BiCMOS quencher has a reaction time, which is 330 ps to 1.1 ns faster than that of the CMOS quencher.","['Single-photon avalanche diodes', 'Transistors', 'Photonics', 'BiCMOS integrated circuits', 'CMOS technology', 'Differential amplifiers', 'Switches']","['SPAD', 'active quenching', 'BiCMOS', 'CMOS']"

"We proposed a new type of distributed feedback laser with alternating active- and passive-cavities (APC DFB), which enjoys the same quantum well layer where the butt-joint re-growth process can be avoided. By utilizing the chirp characteristics of the APC DFB laser in a delayed self-heterodyne system, a chirped microwave signal with a sweep range up to 40 GHz and a sweep period of 25 μs is generated. The power fluctuation of the generated signal between 0-40 GHz within 30 minutes does not exceed 3 dB, and the scanning range fluctuates about 600 MHz. And experiment results show that the thermal efficiency of the current is always related to the working environment. In the static wavelength measurement, it is controlled by the injection current; when the chirped signal is generated, it is determined by the bias current. In particular, the waveform and the period as well as the sweep range of the generated chirped microwave signals can be accurately tuned by adjusting the modulating current, which has provided a deeper insight into the photonic generation of microwave signals.","['Masers', 'Microwave photonics', 'Frequency modulation', 'Microwave theory and techniques', 'Microwave imaging', 'Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers', 'Chirp']","['Distributed feedback laser', 'active- and passive-cavity', 'chirped microwave signals']"

"In this paper, we put forward a novel method for the management of optical collapse through controlling anomalous nonlinear diffraction (NLD) originating from the vectoral effect in metamaterials with simultaneous cubic electric and magnetic nonlinearity, particularly focusing on the unusual behaviors different from those in ordinary positive-index materials. First, NLD in metamaterials can be positive or negative, which makes it possible for us to offer greatly enhanced design freedom to manipulate the behavior of optical collapse at will. Then, it is further demonstrated that the negative NLD can arrest the catastrophic self-focusing of optical wave; however, the positive NLD will lead to the acceleration of its occurrence, as opposed to the case in ordinary positive-index materials. Our analysis is performed by directly numerically solving the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, as well as by using the modulation theory, both showing consistent results. These findings show that NLD in metamaterials can provide a more powerful tool in controlling the collapse of optical wave when compared with the corresponding case in ordinary positive-index materials.","['Metamaterials', 'Optical diffraction', 'Magnetic materials', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Optical solitons', 'Optical refraction', 'Optical variables control']","['Nonlinear optics', 'Metamaterials', 'Self-focusing']"

In comparison with a traditional two-photon dressed rule where the signals move with probe field frequency detuning changing, the novel one indicates that the signals do not move with coupling field frequency detuning changing. The finding is verified by the experimentally detected transmitted probe, multi-wave mixing, and fluorescence signals. We also find that the fluorescence signals show Autler-Townes splitting, which are observed experimentally and explained theoretically. By scanning one coupling field frequency detuning, variation of the dressing strength of another coupling field is revealed.

"Inter-cell interference (ICI) and inter-user interference (IUI) constitute a major issue towards achieving the optimum spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) performance in multi-cell visible light communication (VLC) networks. Hence, advanced multiple access techniques need to be leveraged in order to improve the provided service to the users of such interfering networks. To this end, the present contribution proposes the integration of coordinated beamforming (CB) with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in multi-cell VLC systems. Specifically, we consider the design of beamformers for the common and private streams in a coordinated manner between different attocells, which is shown to provide efficient mitigation of the incurred interference. Additionally, the formulated optimization problem aims to minimize the sum of the mean squared error across all attocells in order to jointly determine the optimum receive filters and coordinated transmit beamformers for RSMA streams. In this context, we illustrate through extensive computer simulations, which are carried out in a realistic setup that assumes noisy channel state information acquisition, the distinct flexibility and robustness of CB-based RSMA in mitigating the incurred interference. Finally, the offered results demonstrate the superiority of CB-based RSMA in terms of achievable SE and EE performance in multi-cell VLC networks compared to the conventional CB-based space division multiple access counterpart.","['Interference', 'Optimization', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Visible light communication', 'Complexity theory', 'Precoding', 'Electrical engineering']","['Coordinated beamforming', 'MIMO', 'multicell communications', 'spectral efficiency', 'optimization', 'RSMA', 'energy efficiency', 'VLC']"
"Optical multicasting has been considered resource efficient for multicast services. Light-tree and light-trail are two technologies that support optical multicasting while the former requires many splitters and thus experiences significant power loss. In this paper, we consider using the light-trail technology for the accommodation of multicast requests in elastic optical networks with adaptive modulation. For better spectrum efficiency, we consider accommodating each multicast by multiple light-trails. We formulate the problem by Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and propose efficient heuristic algorithms. For the impact of accommodation sequence on the algorithm performance, apart from the traditional sequence among different requests, we consider an additional sequence among the destinations of a multicast. For efficient multicast accommodation, we propose several strategies and compare their performances through a range of cases. To avoid a destination occupying excessive resources in certain cases of joining multiple light-trails, we propose an efficient algorithm to delete some duplicated destinations. Numerical results show that the proposed heuristic algorithms significantly outperform a benchmark algorithm and one performs close to the optimal MILP. Also, the algorithm for deleting certain destination replicas largely reduces the spectrum and transmitter usages, up to 41% and 20% for the cases considered, respectively.","['Multicast algorithms', 'Adaptive systems', 'Heuristic algorithms', 'Optical fiber networks', 'Benchmark testing', 'Multicast communication', 'Routing']","['Adaptive modulation', 'elastic optical network', 'light-trail', 'multicast', 'routing and spectrum assignment']"

"In this paper, we report a novel single-mode laser with high immunity to external optical feedback following the principle of active-filter-tuned oscillator. Within the conventional Fabry-Pérot (FP) cavity, a high-Q bandpass filter formed by two tilted gratings with detuned Bragg wavelengths is embedded, and the resultant mode selection mechanism can purify the lasing spectrum by eliminating all but one of the FP cavity modes near the peak wavelength of the said filter. The proposed laser inherently bears the distinct feature of being robust against any small disturbances to oscillation loop. Simulation results from the large-signal dynamic model show that a stable single-mode operation has been achieved with a side-mode suppression ratio of as high as 50 dB. Further, compared with conventional index-coupled distributed feedback lasers, the proposed laser exhibits a much higher immunity to external optical feedback, even at a very high feedback level of −3 dB, and its single-mode yield is also less susceptible to variations of effective facet phases caused by cleaving in semiconductor laser fabrications.","['Semicondcutor lasers', 'Optical feedback', 'Cavity resonators', 'Oscillators', 'Band-pass filters', 'Optical reflection', 'Bragg gratings']","['semiconductor laser', 'single mode lasers', 'external optical feedback']"

"In dual-carrier (DC)-paired fiber optic long-reach transmission, which extends a point-to-multipoint coherent system to a cascaded reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexing (ROADM) system, a narrow passband causes severe performance degradation of the edge subcarriers. In this study, we proposed two-dimensional frequency and polarization domain coding and multicarrier-frequency control for cascaded ROADM filtering of robust multicarrier transmissions at a single wavelength. The proposed coding scheme reduced fiber nonlinearity, polarization-dependent loss (PDL), and passband narrowing (PBN) simultaneously. The multicarrier frequency control algorithm, which feeds back the received signal quality at multiple points, reduced PBN owing to long-term laser frequency drifts. With the proposed coding, the Q value of 56 Gbit/s × DC-paired dual-polarized (DP)-4QAM and 112 Gbit/s × DC-paired DP-16QAM signals improved by 1 dB and 0.2 dB, respectively, compared to that when no coding was used. Furthermore, the long-term frequency control emulated through the emulation model of laser frequency drifts and the performance degradation of average Q value were less than 0.4 dB and 0.1 dB, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, no other study has evaluated point-to-multipoint transmission over ROADM-induced optical filtering systems that apply frequency and polarization domain coding and multicarrier frequency control for DC-paired DP- M -QAM signals.

"A cubic Stewart platform with an image sensor meausring is proposed for a line-of-sight (LOS) pointing and stabilization.

The hemisphere reflector is not only used for photon recycling to increase the energy efficiency but also to keep the energy efficiency nearly unchanged when the number of the multiplexing laser increases. The experimental measurement shows that the photon recycling with the hemisphere reflector can increase the energy efficiency from 36.2% to 53.3% for on-axis incidence, and 35.2% to 55.7% for off-axis incidence. Besides, the efficiency keeps the same up to three-laser multiplexing in the experiment, and potentially can be extended to more than 10 in the simulation for various hole structures.

A compact erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) is demonstrated using a piece of 1.5-m-long erbium-doped fiber (EDF) with a microfiber coupled to a silica microsphere at the output end. A stable laser output is achieved due to the recirculation of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) light inside the linear cavity and the incorporation of microsphere which serves as both a laser filtering element and a mirror.

"Quantitatively evaluating the reliability of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor networks becomes problematic as the number of working fiber failures increases in dedicated protection mode. To solve this problem, a signal attenuation rate (SAR) of the sensor system is proposed to evaluate self-healing capabilities after increased working fiber failures. We analyze the influencing factors and calculate the theoretical values of SAR under different network states for values of split ratio a = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9.

"For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, analytical expressions for mutually compensating the curved mirror astigmatism in the two terminal arms of a folded resonator are deduced and experimentally verified. The analytical expressions are derived using the theory of the propagation and transformation of Gaussian beams under few assumptions. Our exact analytical expressions describe the necessary and sufficient conditions for simultaneously compensating astigmatism in two arms of a sequence of two off-axis curved mirrors. The theoretical results indicate that, when the astigmatism compensation expressions are satisfied, the astigmatism introduced by a folded curved mirror can be mutually compensated by another folded curved mirror, even if there is no additional Brewster element inside the cavity. The astigmatism can only be successfully eliminated by using a pair of concave mirrors or convex mirrors. Our analytical expressions can be used to design astigmatically compensated folded resonators without a Brewster element. A typical side-pumped z-shaped cavity Nd:YAG laser is employed to demonstrate the astigmatic compensation. Experimental measurements of the pattern of the laser output beam show that not only the spot intensity profile deformation but, in addition, the phase distortion in the two terminal arms can be simultaneously compensated completely in the cavity, which is in good agreement with the analytical predictions.","['Lenses', 'Mirrors', 'Optical resonators', 'Laser beams', 'Laser noise', 'Laser cavity resonators']","['Solid-state lasers', 'Optical resonators', 'Laser cavity resonators', 'Astigmatism compensation', 'Phase compensation']"

"Fiber stretchers are used to stabilize the effective length of optical fiber links, but if they are not carefully calibrated, they can produce polarization changes and instabilities, which interact with the polarization mode dispersion (PMD) of the fiber link producing phase changes on the transmitted signals. Those can be minimized if the input polarization is aligned to one of the two orthogonal polarization states of the fiber stretcher, which show minimum polarization change across the dynamic range of the stretcher.

"On the basis of the photoelectric properties and hydrophilicity and multimode interference of Graphene Oxide (GO), this study proposes an all-fiber humidity sensor. Two core-offset regions are constructed with a fiber fusion splicer, and a GO film is coated on a single-mode fiber (SMF) between the core-offset regions to form a humidity-sensitive Mach–Zehnder interference structure. As the external humidity environment changes, the refractive index of the GO changes, and the light in the SMF is modulated by humidity. External humidity is measured by detecting the changes in the wavelength of the transmission spectrum of the sensing structure. A saturated salt solution is used to build a stable humidity environment. The sensitivity of the sensor is 0.05 nm/% relative humidity (RH) at 35.3%–95.8% RH, and the linear relationship between the characteristic wavelength and RH is 88%. In addition, the linear relationship between the light intensity and the RH of the sensor at a single wavelength at 1571 nm is analyzed, and the linearity is 97.45%. According to this finding, photoelectric conversion is used to convert the light intensity signal into a voltage signal.

"A simple schemefor generating chaotic signals with concealed time-delay signature (TDS) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The architecture of the system is based on a semiconductor laser (SL) under multi-path optical feedback (MPOF) provided by a 2 × 2 fiber coupler (FC) and a fiber mirror (FM). The results show that SLs with MPOF are more beneficial for achieving TDS suppressed chaotic output than those with single optical feedback (SOF) systems. In addition, the TDS of the chaotic signal generated by the SL under MPOF is insensitive to the length deviation of the feedback cavities, and therefore such a scheme is convenient for practical application. Furthermore, the influence of FC coupling ratio in the MPOF module, feedback strength, and bias current of the SL on the TDS is comprehensively studied. By selecting suitable parameters, the TDS of the chaotic signal generated by the SL under MPOF can be completely concealed. Finally, permutation entropy (PE) is adopted to evaluate the complexity of the generated chaotic signal, and the result demonstrates that the suppression of TDS does not lead to the degradation of complexity for the proposed scheme.","['Optical feedback', 'Chaotic communication', 'Optical attenuators', 'Couplings', 'Fiber optics', 'Optical coupling', 'Time series analysis']","['Chaos', 'multi-path optical feedback (MPOF)', 'semiconductor laser (SL)', 'time-delay signature (TDS)']"

"To overcome the inherent bandwidth limitation of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ultraviolet communication (UVC) channel, a novel space division multiplexing (SDM) framework based on non-coplanar rotation angle is established. The influence of SDM structure parameters on inter-channel interference (ICI) is studied to obtain the optimal antenna configuration. And a Gaussian approximate distribution (GAD) signal detection model is presented, which simplifies the calculation of the Bit error rate (BER) of the Photon multiplier tube (PMT) reception and is suitable for complex ICI analysis. Furthermore, a low ICI scheme based on the relationship between BER and the interference factor is proposed to increase the data transmission rate or reduce the alignment configuration. As a result, the maximum data rate increases to 34 Mbps, or the alignment demand decreases by 33.33% at most. Moreover, these analysis results and techniques can be applied to other NLOS scattering optical wireless communication systems.","['Signal detection', 'MIMO communication', 'Interference', 'Photonics', 'Receivers', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Scattering']","['Non-line-of-sight ultraviolet communication', 'spatial multiplexing', 'high data transfer rate']"

"We realize a high spatially resolved idler imaging with a compact noncollinear optical parametric amplifier, which is based on type-II phase matching (PM). Using an intense femtosecond laser pulse train as the pump, this amplifier can amplify a separate continuous-wave (CW) signal with high gain and broad gain bandwidth with no need for time synchronization between the pump and the signal. In spite of the noncollinear arrangement of the amplifier, the spatial geometric smearing (SGS) is eliminated inside the amplifier due to the collinear Poynting vectors of the signal and the idler, which promotes the horizontal spatial resolution of the idler image to approach its vertical spatial resolution. Our experiments show that this design can improve the 2-D space–bandwidth product (SBP) of the idler imaging by a factor of 2.8, compared with the noncollinear type-I PM amplifier.

"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are at the heart of several machine learning applications, while they suffer from computational complexity due to their large number of parameters and operations. Recently, all-optical implementation of the CNNs has achieved many attentions, however, the recently proposed optical architectures for CNNs cannot fully utilize the tremendous capabilities of optical processing, due to the required electro-optical conversions in-between successive layers. To implement an all-optical multi-layer CNN, it is essential to optically implement all required operations, namely convolution, summation of channels’ output for each convolutional kernel feeding the nonlinear unit, nonlinear activation function, and finally, pooling operations. Considering the lack of multi-layer photonic CNN implementation, in this paper, we explore a fully-optical design for implementing successive convolutional layers in an optical CNN. As a proof of concept, and without loss of generality, we considered two successive optical layers in the proposed network, named as 2L-OPCNN, for comparative studies against electrical counterpart and single optical layer CNN.

"We have fabricated highly luminescent samples with erbium-doped amorphous silicon suboxide $(a\hbox{-SiO}_{x} \langle \hbox{Er}\rangle)$ layers on $\hbox{SiO}_{2}/\hbox{Si}$ substrates. The layers are designed to provide a resonance with large modal overlap with the active material and with low quality factor (Q-factor) at 1540 nm. Also, the structure has higher Q-factor resonances in the wavelength range between 800 and 1000 nm. Within this range, strong light emission from $a\hbox{-SiO}_{x}$ defect-related radiative centers and emission from the $\hbox{Er}^{3+}\,{}^{4}{ \rm I}_{11/2} - ^{4}{\rm I}_{15/2}$ optical transition (980 nm) are observed.

"A radio frequency (RF)-assisted Sagnac interferometer based on a dual-loop optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) is experimentally demonstrated for high-precision magnetic field measurement, in which the tapered fiber covered with the magnetic fluid (MF) as the magnetic field sensing head is embedded in the Sagnac interferometer. The evanescent field of the tapered fiber can interact with the MF under the external magnetic field to cause the birefringence variation of the fundamental mode, leading to the change in the free spectral range (FSR) of the interferometer, which can be mapped to the oscillation frequency shift of the OEO in the microwave domain. By the above converting, the magnetic field measurement with high interrogation speed and resolution can be realized. In addition, the designed device shows a certain measurement directionality of the magnetic field due to two orthogonally polarized fundamental modes asymmetric to the magnetic field, obtaining a good conformity with the constructed theoretical models.

With only few cavity modes contained within the Brillouin gain curve, the dynamics of self-pulsing was not observed for the stimulated Brillouin scattering signal generated by each pump mode in the experiment. The results from two different experimental schemes show that both the Brillouin and ytterbium gains are required to support enough Brillouin pump and stokes cavity modes for partial mode locking. We also show that it is the coupling between the stimulated Brillouin scattering of the neighboring Brillouin pump modes that plays a direct role in the partial phase synchronization between different stokes modes. Furthermore, we proposed a theoretical model about the partially mode-locked laser dynamics. Based on the model, the numerical results agree quantitatively with the experimental ones.

"Visible light communication (VLC) has emerged as an eco-friendly and low-cost technology for the next-generation communication systems. However, for VLC systems, existing works report performance degradation due to light-emitting-diode (LED) non-linearity, multipath and relative mobility between the transmitter and the receiver. Additionally, multipath and user-mobility introduce inter-symbol-interference (ISI) and frequency-domain spreading which degrades the performance of VLC systems. For such scenarios, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is well-known to jointly addresses impairments due to multipath and user-mobility. To mitigate the distortions due to LED non-linearity, recently reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)-based random Fourier feature (RFF) techniques have emerged which alleviate the dependence on learning a dictionary and, outperforms classical polynomial based techniques. However, performance of these techniques is sensitive to the choice of kernel-width. Thus, for the OTFS systems impaired by LED non-linearity, this manuscript proposes a hyperparameter-free RFF-based post-distorter, under finite-memory budget without the need of explicitly tuning kernel-width for best performance. Analytical bounds for the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the proposed post-distorter are presented, and validated via simulations over realistic VLC channels. From the results it is verified that the proposed receiver achieves better BER performance over uncompensated scenario and classical baseline polynomial based technique.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Symbols', 'Transforms', 'Receivers', 'Time-frequency analysis', 'Time-domain analysis', 'Modulation']","['Visible light communication (VLC)', 'orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)', 'random Fourier feature (RFF)', 'bit error rate (BER)']"

"Plasmonic interferometric imaging has been widely used for fast and label-free detection to nano-objects, which associates the interference between launched and scattered surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). As scattering of SPPs is affected by the characteristics of nano-objects, particle size, particle index and particle-interface distances have been retrieved from the imaging. Refractive index of dielectric, which tailors the resonant wavelength of launched SPPs, is also a key issue to plasmonic interferometric imaging. Yet, the influence of refractive index to plasmonic interferometric imaging has not been investigated. In this work, we connected the dielectric refractive index to the interferometric image intensity distribution, and found that both fringe periodicities and intensity profiles along SPP wavefronts were tailored by the refractive index, which is illustrated by using glucose solutions with different concentrations. Our research illustrates the pattern change of plasmonic interferometric imaging induced by dielectric refractive index, which not only paves the way for the basic understanding on the plasmonic interferometric imaging, but also provides a new potential visual method for real-time refractive index sensing and monitoring, which will be applied to food safety and environment monitoring.","['Plasmons', 'Imaging', 'Refractive index', 'Interference', 'Nanoparticles', 'Gold', 'Glucose']","['Plasmonic', 'surface plasmon polaritons', 'interferometric imaging', 'refractive index']"

"Electroabsorption modulated lasers (EMLs) is sensitive to the residual facet reflection (RFR), which can cause a low-frequency drop (LFD) in the modulation response. The LFD may result in output waveform distortion, especially for high-data rate and multi-level modulation. We verify by simulation and experiments that the effect of LFD on the EML performance and propose to use LFD as one of the key performance indices for qualifying EMLs in high-speed optical transceivers. LFD can be suppressed by incorporating partial-corrugated-grating (PCG) in the laser section.

This provides the robustness in applying the PCG-DFB to achieve a flat intensity modulation response or to enhance the output waveform under large signal modulation. By designing the PCG-EML to have about 60% of grating region, it can reach >80% of SMY and improve the average Q-value from the reduced LFD in the modulation response.

"We thoughtfully investigate the feasibility of reducing the mode-coupling caused crosstalk by optimizing the practical parameters of the few-mode fiber (FMF), based on the linear coupling theory. According to our simulation results, the low crosstalk FMF could be achieved with the small fiber core, the low refractive-index (RI) related parameters, the long operating-wavelength and the low core-eccentricity (CE). Moreover, the transmission behaviors over the fixed coupling and the random coupling scenarios are also discussed. The power distribution and the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) evolutions along FMF reveal the impacts from the mode-coupling induced crosstalk in the spatial division multiplexing (SDM) transmission system. The random nature of the mode coupling suggesting the turbulent results are obtained in our simulation, confirmed the observation in the SDM test.

"Cooperative quantum cutting mechanism in a spectral converter of Tm 3+ /Yb 3+ -codoped tellurite glass is investigated by setting up and solving the theoretical model of rate equations and power propagation equations in MATLAB.

"The modulation response of monolithically integrated external optical injection-locking (EOIL) semiconductor ring lasers based on photon-photon resonance effect was systematically analyzed. The simulation results show that the modulation response of the EOIL laser is strongly dependent on the internal loss of the ring laser. Assuming that the waveguide was loss-free, the modulation bandwidth of as high as 67.5 GHz was predicted. However, due to the excessive loss associated with the bending waveguide of the circular-shaped ring laser, the modulation performance of such EOIL laser has no any advantage over its free-running counterpart. Instead, use of rectangular-shaped ring laser as the slave laser is proposed to circumvent the issue associated with the excessive waveguide loss, since the internal loss, in this case, is only dependent on the reflectivity of the total reflection mirrors. Simulation shows the modulation bandwidth of at least 38 GHz is achievable in such EOIL laser, provided the reflectivity of the total reflection mirrors is greater than 96%. It is believed that this theoretical study will facilitate the future experimental demonstration of the monolithically integrated EOIL lasers.","['Ring lasers', 'Semiconductor lasers', 'Laser modes', 'Waveguide lasers', 'Modulation', 'Laser theory', 'Nanoscale devices']","['Direct modulation lasers', 'external optical injection-locking', 'monolithically integrated', 'photon-photon resonance', 'ring lasers']"

"Structure and design were proposed for a kind of novel multifunctional M × N microring array side-coupled Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) electrooptic switch/ filter. The device can be operated as a notch or bandpass filter by applying voltages on the under-reference MZI arm, and it can also serve as an optical switch by applying voltage on microrings.

As a switch, for making driving voltages under both operation states below 5 V, N and M should be within the range of 2-8. For the seven switches (M = 1, 8 ≥ N ≥ 2), their insertion losses are within 0.85-0.35 dB at bar state and within 0.14-1.70 dB at cross state; the crosstalk are within -20.79- -31.11 dB at bar state and within -13.86--20.36 dB at cross state; and their 3-dB electrical bandwidths are 18.5-30.5 GHz, whereas their 3-dB optical bandwidths for ports 1 and 2 are 18.1-40.0 GHz and 19.0-55.0 GHz, respectively.

"Multihop relaying is a potential technique to mitigate channel impairments in optical wireless communications (OWC). In this paper, multiple fixed-gain amplify-and-forward (AF) relays are employed to enhance the OWC performance under the combined effect of atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, and fog. We consider a long-range OWC link by modeling the atmospheric turbulence by the Fisher-Snedecor {\mathcal {F}} distribution, pointing errors by the generalized non-zero boresight model, and random path loss due to fog. We also consider a short-range OWC system by ignoring the impact of atmospheric turbulence. We derive novel upper bounds on the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both short and long-range multihop OWC systems by developing exact statistical results for a single-hop OWC system under the combined effect of {\mathcal {F}} -turbulence channels, non-zero boresight pointing errors, and fog-induced fading. Based on these expressions, we present analytical expressions of outage probability (OP) and average bit-error-rate (ABER) performance for the considered OWC systems involving single-variate Fox's H and Meijer's G functions. Moreover, asymptotic expressions of the outage probability in high SNR region are developed using simpler Gamma functions to provide insights on the effect of channel and system parameters. The derived analytical expressions are validated through Monte-Carlo simulations, and the scaling of the OWC performance with the number of relay nodes is demonstrated with a comparison to the single-hop transmission.","['Atmospheric modeling', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Fading channels', 'Relays', 'Probability density function', 'Spread spectrum communication', 'Adaptive optics']","['Fisher-Snedecor ${\\mathcal {F}}$ distribution', 'foggy channel', 'multihop', 'non-zero boresight pointing errors', 'optical wireless communication']"

"Visible light communications (VLC) techniques are viewed as promising candidates for the upcoming B5G&6G mobile wireless networks. Due to the broadcast nature of VLC channel, physical layer security (PLS) techniques have been considered and explored to improve the confidentiality of VLC transmission. Nevertheless, almost all current designs focus on application scenarios including sufficient transmitters and fail to match the scenarios with limited, even just two transmitters. For addressing this challenge, in this article, multiple optical beam switching scheme is proposed. Unlike conventional Lambertian beam based technique paradigm, the given scheme tentatively utilize two asymmetry non-Lambertian beams to configure each VLC transmitter. Numerical results show that, for the typical center legitimate receiver, compared with about 0.92 bps/Hz average secrecy capacity (SC) of the conventional Lambertian beam configuration, up to 5.55 bps/Hz average SC gain is acquired through the proposed beam switching scheme. Moreover, this potential gain will be enhanced to about 5.86 bps/Hz when three candidate non-Lambertian beams are available for each transmitter.","['Optical beams', 'Optical transmitters', 'Optical switches', 'Visible light communication', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Optical receivers', 'Three-dimensional displays']","['Multiple optical beam switching', 'physical layer security', 'secrecy capacity', 'visible light communications']"
"Bound state in the continuum (BIC), as a novel eigenmode with infinitely high-quality factor, has received great attention in modern optical science. Mode coupling in dielectric metasurfaces opens possibilities in searching for robust BICs. Here, we discover multiple BICs in periodic dielectric resonators composed of a silicon rectangular bar and a silicon ring in one lattice. For the symmetry-protected BIC at-Γ point, a sharp electromagnetically induced transparency window can be formed by either tilting incident angle to induce the ‘bright-bright’ mode coupling, or by displacing the ring to generate the ‘bright-dark’ mode coupling. Besides, the coupling between two resonators leads to a new energy band in the dielectric metasurface. As a result, two off-Γ BICs are formed owing to avoided crossings with two energy bands, and another one belongs to the single-resonance parametric BIC. Thus, our coupled resonators possess superior abilities to judiciously engineer BICs via versatile physical mechanisms. Taking advantage exclusively of coupled resonators in dielectric metasurfaces provides fresh insights into the creation of both symmetry-protected and accidental BICs, which enables profound advancements in designing novel photonic devices.","['Resonators', 'Metasurfaces', 'Dielectrics', 'Couplings', 'Bars', 'Silicon', 'Q-factor']","['Bound states in the continuum', 'electromagnetically induced transparency', 'metasurface', 'Q-factor']"

Split meander lines, plus spiral rings, are carefully adjusted to accommodate complex equivalent currents for generating the required transmitted phase.

"Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a promising technology to provide high throughput and overall improved system performance at affordable cost for next-generation passive optical networks (NG-PONs).

However, MPA requires accurate and effective channel estimation due to the interference between the user's signals on the same resource block and suffers uncertain convergence caused by the cycles in the factor graph. In this paper, a graph neural networks (GNN)-based detection method is proposed for SCMA-PON, which performs channel impairment compensation and signal detection in a joint manner. 25.5 Gb/s SCMA-OFDM system over 20/60 km single mode fiber link is simulated to demonstrate the feasibility with 8.5-G class optical devices.

"Modern computing and data storage systems increasingly rely on parallel architectures. The necessity for high-bandwidth data links has made optical communication a critical constituent of modern information systems and silicon the leading platform for creating the necessary optical components. While silicon is arguably the most extensively studied material in history, one of its most important attributes, i.e., an analysis of its capacity to carry optical information, has not been reported. The calculation of the information capacity of silicon is complicated by nonlinear losses, which are phenomena that emerge in optical nanowires as a result of the concentration of optical power in a small geometry. While nonlinear loss in silicon is well known, noise and fluctuations that arise from it have never been considered. Here, we report fluctuations that arise from two-photon absorption, plasma effect, cross-phase modulation, and four-wave mixing and investigate their role in limiting the information capacity of silicon. We show that these fluctuations become significant and limit the capacity well before nonlinear processes affect optical transmission.

To investigate the properties of NAbLM in contrast with typical nonlinear optical loop mirror (NOLM), an asymmetric optical coupler is used in the NAbLM. In experiment, both the NAbLM and NOLM can be used to mode-lock a Yb-doped fiber (YDF) laser and enable a type of noise-like pulse (NLP) generation. Noticeably, however, it is further found that, in comparison to NOLM, NAbLM evidently enables both temporal and radio frequency (RF) noise suppressions, as well as elimination of RF variations. Further calculations show that the saturable property of the incorporated absorber plays a vital role in differing the NAbLM from typical NOLM.

"We report an abnormal waveguiding phenomenon that the fundamental mode guided in strip waveguides of a special Ti-diffused LiNbO 3 waveguide structure, in which an array of 4and 6-μm-wide strip waveguides is embedded in a planar waveguide, nonperiodically oscillates with the wavelength along the waveguide width direction.

The phenomenon is abnormal as it displays the features of multimode interference (MMI), but the single-mode pattern was captured from the strip waveguide at the 1.5-μm wavelength. Further numerical analysis for the waveguiding characteristics shows that the strip waveguide also supports a nearly cutoff higher order mode, in addition to the fundamental mode, allowing to explain the abnormal phenomenon: the MMI may take place in some regions of the strip waveguide and the observed singlemode pattern is because the higher order mode, which takes part in the MMI, is close to the cutoff.","['Planar waveguides', 'Strips', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Loss measurement', 'Oscillators', 'Wavelength measurement']","['Ti:$\\hbox{LiNbO}_{3}$ (LN) waveguide', 'abnormal waveguiding characteristic', 'multimode interference (MMI)']"

"Pure Q-switching (self-pulsating) behaviour is shown for the first time in an optically injected two-section quantum-dot laser. Upon CW optical injection, it was possible to switch the operation regime from free-running mode-locking to locked Q-switching. Under this regime, the pulse repetition rate of around 1 GHz was tunable with injection power (by more than 100 MHz) and absorber reverse bias.

"The security and reliability of free space optical (FSO) communications and the trade-off between the two are the most critical characteristics to emphasize in FSO systems, especially as optical wireless communications continue to evolve. In this work, we investigate the impact of opportunistic transmit aperture selection (TAS) on the security-reliability trade-off (SRT) of the multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) free space optical system. We consider a general scenario in which the FSO system consists of a transmitter side with K users and a single receiver with N apertures communicating over generalized Malaga-M turbulence channels. We derive the TAS combined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distributions for the FSO MIMO channel between the transmitting users and the receiver. A statistical analysis of the TAS scheme is performed, where the k th best user with the highest SNR is selected. Based on this analysis, the closed-form expressions for the outage probability, average bit error rate, intercept probability, and SRT are derived. Then, the diversity advantages provided by the channel variations considering the atmospheric turbulence and generalized nonzero boresight pointing errors are further discussed. The results show that the considered TAS significantly improves the security, reliability, and SRT performance and has the potential to solve existing FSO communication problems. Monte Carlo simulations are used to verify the correctness of the numerical results.","['Laser beams', 'Security', 'Reliability', 'Apertures', 'Adaptive optics', 'Optical receivers', 'Atmospheric modeling']","['Free space optical', 'security', 'reliability', 'security-reliability trade-off', 'opportunistic scheduling selection', 'transmit aperture selection', 'atmospheric turbulence', 'nonzero boresight pointing errors', 'multiple-input–multiple-output']"

"The optical interaction mechanism of a nanohole pair milled in an opaque gold film by means of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) propagation is investigated. This interaction depends on the polarization direction of the incident light and the separation distance between the nanoholes. It is found that when the nanoholes are illuminated by a plane wave incident light polarized parallel to the axis of the nanohole pair, the SPP waves can propagate between the nanoholes, and therefore, the nanoholes can interact through SPPs. In contrast, it is shown that for the incident plane wave polarized perpendicular to the pair axis, the propagation direction of the SPPs is normal to the pair axis, and thus, a weak interaction through the SPPs can occur between the nanoholes. It is also shown that in order to investigate the interaction of the nanoholes through the SPP waves, each nanohole can be modeled by a magnetic dipole, which propagates SPPs. Thus, the optical properties of the interacting nanoholes can be modeled using a magnetic-coupled dipole approximation method accounting SPPs to confirm the simulation results.","['Optical polarization', 'Optical films', 'Optical surface waves', 'Magnetic separation', 'Gold']","['Subwavelength structures', 'plasmonics', 'surface', 'nanostructures']"

"Nonlinear frequency division multiplexing (NFDM) system is an optional candidate to overcome the fiber nonlinearity limit. A full-spectrum modulated NFDM system, modulating data on combined continuous spectrum (CS) and discrete spectrum (DS) together, was proposed in recent years to improve the data rates and spectral efficiency (SE) by exploiting all the degrees of freedom offered in the nonlinear spectrum. However, the selection of discrete eigenvalues greatly affects the performance of both CS and DS. Designing appropriate eigenvalues of DS is an important issue to ensure the high SE and excellent performance of the system. In this paper, we discussed the selcection principle of eigenvalues and analyzed it from multiple perspectives, 11 eigenvalues with 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (64QAM) are selected for DS. Besides optimizing the eigenvalues at the transmitter, the linear minimum mean-square estimate (LMMSE) method was used at the receiver to furtherly improve the performance of DS. Through the numerical simulation, a 113 Gb/s (SE of 2.8 bits/s/Hz) full-spectrum modulated NFDM system was set up and transmitted 1120 km distance, where the Q-factors of both CS and DS are above the hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) threshold.

"H0-type photonic crystal nanocavities hold high quality factors Q and quite small cavity mode volumes. This study finds their ultrahigh Q structures, which allow stable operation as a nanolaser even with fabrication-induced disordering. Previously, we generated a neural network model for predicting Q s, searched for a high- Q structure and its slotted version, and found those showing Q = 1,140,000 and 91,600, respectively. These values were an order of magnitude higher than those obtained by manual optimizations. However, further improvement above these values was saturated because of the insufficient accuracy of the neural network model at the high Q regime. Instead of applying the model, we repeated directly calculating Q s, implementing a covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy algorithm to search structures in this study. Consequently, Q values were increased up to 14,500,000 and 741,000 while consuming shorter calculation time. We also confirmed that these structures significantly improve robustness against structural disordering.","['Optimization', 'Predictive models', 'Finite difference methods', 'Time-domain analysis', 'Data models', 'Artificial neural networks', 'Slabs']","['Photonic crystal', 'nanolaaser', 'evolutionary calculation', 'machine learning']"

"Synchronization is a long-standing challenge in modern large-scale distributed systems, and newly deployed systems such as 5G and modern netted radars require more extensive synchronization. As the number of distributed stations increasing, new synchronization solution with much effort on extensibility is highly expected. In this paper we first analyze the requirements on extensibility of fiber-based sync systems, and then propose a phase-stabilized side-branch radio-over-fiber (RoF) link, which fully satisfies the extensibility requirements. The extensible side-branch link can be constructed at any intermediate point along the main link, without any reconfiguration at the central station, which is especially feasible when adding extra stations in system capacity expansion. The main link phase shift is first stabilized by tuning the optical carrier wavelength, while another phase-locked-loop constructed at the starting point of the branch link stabilizes the phase shift from the central station to the end of branch link, by phase locking two phase-varying signals. Moreover, the phase-stable side branch is inherently extensible to multiple frequency signals, which can be used in receivers requiring multiple local oscillators (LOs). Two frequency signals are simultaneously disseminated to the end of branch link in the experiment, with frequency stability optimization of two orders of magnitude on both LOs achieved. The proposed stable side-branch RoF link shows the potential of constructing a highly-extensible frequency dissemination network for the synchronization in modern distributed systems.","['Synchronization', 'Optical filters', 'Optical feedback', 'Optical reflection', 'Frequency synchronization', 'Optical modulation', 'Optical fiber dispersion']","['Frequency synchronization', 'extensible side-branch', 'distributed systems', 'radio-over-fiber']"
"Sub-wavelength metal grating structures exhibit extraordinary transmission (EOT) due to constructive interference of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) tunneling.

"The traditional polarization imaging techniques cannot obtain the polarization characteristics with global variation, and the reconstruction of the target with different optical properties concurrently is seriously distorted. In this work, we overcome the aforementioned shortcomings by using the polar decomposition method to estimate the Mueller matrix of the target in the full field of view. Simultaneously, the illumination light with globally varying polarization state is calculated to suppress the noise caused by computational imaging. The descattering imaging experiments through turbid water indicate that the images recovered by our method present the similarity to the targets without scattering, and the noise is suppressed to some extent. Further, we prove the superiority of the proposed method by comparing with other polarization underwater imaging strategies.","['Matrix decomposition', 'Scattering', 'Optical engineering', 'Optical distortion', 'Optical scattering', 'Optical polarization', 'Optical imaging']","['Polarimetric imaging', 'mueller matrix', 'scattering measurements', 'turbid media']"

"Photonics-assisted microwave instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM) is considered as a promising technique for detecting an unknown radio-frequency (RF) signal, which has advantages of broad frequency measurement range and fast processing speed. Up to date, there is no photonics-assisted IFM system that can essentially measure an unknown RF signal time-frequency information with power fluctuating seriously. Moreover, the measurement accuracy and frequency modulation recognition are not as good as those of traditional electronic methods. Here, we propose an IFM scheme based on the combination of Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) and Brillouin loss spectrum (BLS), which is RF-power-independent with high measurement efficiency. The combination of BGS and BLS to construct the amplitude comparison function (ACF) can reduce the influence of RF signal power fluctuation within 21.27 dB by single-shot measuring. When an appropriate frequency interval with frequency domain monotonous power of microwave comb signal is modulated on the pump lightwave, the IFM accuracy of the unknown signal reaches about 1 MHz. After the initial calibration of the system, it can recognize the time-frequency variation of single tone signal, linear frequency modulated signal (LFM), nonlinear frequency modulated signal (NLFM), and Costas signal. This scheme will help to promote the application of the IFM in the field of spectrum reconnaissance and reception.","['Frequency measurement', 'Scattering', 'Time-frequency analysis', 'Frequency modulation', 'Gain', 'Loss measurement', 'Optical fiber amplifiers']","['Instantaneous frequency measurement', 'Brillouin gain and loss spectrum', 'power-independent', 'Costas signal']"

"A reflective optical encoder has been proposed and realized capitalizing on a miniaturized sensing head, which integrates both a pair of index gratings and a beam router in a plastic smart frame. The index gratings play a role in selectively transmitting the incident beam carrying the periodic grating pattern of a code scale. The beam router, consisting of a collimating lens in conjunction with a prism, is used to collimate and steer the beam originating from a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) toward the code scale. The proposed encoder is rigorously designed by ray optic simulations and manufactured by passively aligning a smart frame, which is produced by plastic injection molding, with a VCSEL at λ = 850 nm and two semicircular photodetectors. The index grating is created by forming an Al grating pattern of a 10- μm pitch on a silica substrate. Two output signals provide sinusoidal signals, which are 90 ° out of phase from each other. The period of the signals is 4 μs at a frequency of 250 kHz, which is equivalent to a period of 10 μm. As expected, the relative phase relationship is reversed by altering the direction of rotation of the code scale. By examining either of the two output signals, we can simply demonstrate positional and angular resolutions of about 10 μm and 0.04 °, respectively.

"We present a new mechanism to realize broadband transmission (BT) at near infrared in a dual-layer metallic-silver-grating structure with a silicon nitride dielectric spacer.

"Chaotic optical communication based on conventional external cavity semiconductor laser is a very promising solution for physical layer secure communication. However, the intrinsic time delay signature (TDS) associated with the external cavity length and the potential direct linear filtering (DLF) or synchronization utilization attack greatly threaten the system security. In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate a novel scheme for TDS suppression and security enhancement of chaotic optical communication based on external temporal self-feedback hardware encryption and decryption. In this scheme, the confidential chaotic modulated signal is temporally scrambled in the time domain by two optical dispersion components and an electro-optic self-feedback phase modulation loop between them, which simultaneously conceal the TDS and enhance the security against malicious attacks. Proof-of-principle demonstration for a security enhanced chaotic optical communication system with error free transmission is successfully achieved. The proposed scheme may provide a promising way for pure-hardware based physical secure chaotic optical communication systems.","['Chaotic communication', 'Optical fibers', 'Fiber optics', 'Optical feedback', 'Optical transmitters', 'Dispersion', 'Optical fiber communication']","['Optical communications', 'optical encryption', 'chaos', 'semiconductor lasers']"
"A resonant-ring-assisted large mode area segmented cladding fiber (RR-SCF) with a high-index ring in the core is proposed. Numerical investigations of the effects of the high-index ring on the leakage losses of guiding modes, mode area, and electric field distribution of FM of the proposed fiber show the high-index ring not only increases the ratio of the loss between the fundamental mode (FM) and the higher-order modes (HOMs) but also improves the electric field distribution of the FM to be flat. By taking these advantages of the high-index-ring-assisted core, the effective single-mode (SM) operation is achieved in the proposed fiber bent in any orientation, which makes up the defect of the conventional RR-SCF that the SM output is affected by the bending orientation. Meanwhile, the mode area is enlarged. Furthermore, the effects of the heat load, duty cycle, bending, and operation wavelength on the fiber performance are analyzed. The results show single-mode operation in all bending orientations with a mode area larger than 824 μm 2 can be achieved at a tight bending radius of 15 cm to 16 cm when the operating wavelength ranges from 1.06 μm to 1.76 μm.

"A novel scheme of self-oscillation multicarrier light source based on recirculating frequency shift loop (RFSL) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated in this paper. Compared with conventional RFSL-based multicarrier generation schemes, the radio frequency (RF) signal for driving the modulator in RFSL is generated by an internal self-oscillation of the optical carrier instead of the external commercial RF source device. The self-oscillation method significantly reduces the cost of the light source and decreases the phase noise of RF signal and multicarrier signal. In the experiment, we successfully generate a single-mode oscillation RF signal with the phase noise of −85.10 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset frequency. A total of 49 multicarrier optical signals from 1550.59 nm to 1554.44 nm with the power fluctuation as low as 3 dB are obtained.

"As a special imaging technique, one of the most important advantages of single-pixel imaging (SPI) than conventional imaging method is that it can recover the object image even through turbid medium. In these situations, the noises bring by the turbid medium usually obey special rules in statistics. While in some other applications, SPI is performed in the environment with complicate ambient light, in which no prior information of the environment noise is known. Aiming at this situation, in this work, the frame-by-frame subtraction-based compressive sensing SPI (FFS-CSPI) method with random 0/1 pattern is used to decrease the effect from the unknown ambient light. The noise robustness of the FFS-CSPI method is analyzed and compared with Hadamard CSPI. In simulation and experiment, two kinds of noises, from external light source and from background video, are considered. The results prove that FFS-CSPI with random 0/1 patterns can achieve higher image quality than conventional mean subtraction method and Hadamard CSPI with the same measurement number. Considering the high refresh rate of digital micromirror device when it loads the 0/1 binary patterns, the imaging speed is acceptable.

"A silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) contains an array of microcells that can each detect individual photons. Consequently, it can arguably result in the most sensitive receiver in visible light communication (VLC). However, each microcell needs a period of several nanoseconds to recover after detecting a photon. This creates a non-linear response and introduces a unique form of inter-symbol interference. In this paper, we first show that this interference splits each element of the received signal constellation into multiple clusters. This observation motivates the investigation into the use of a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) to deal with the impact of the nonlinearity. Both the training procedures and the performance of the RBFNN are explained and discussed in detail. The influence of the number of the RBFNN centers, the widths of the centers, the constellation size and the period of the transmitted signal samples on the system performance are investigated. In addition, two different RBFNN-based data demodulation methods are introduced. The simulation results suggest that the new RBFNN-aided receivers reduce the negative impacts of the SiPM nonlinearity and can result in lower bit error rates (BERs) for a wide range of irradiances on the SiPM.","['Photonics', 'Microcell networks', 'Single-photon avalanche diodes', 'Optical distortion', 'Interference', 'Optical sensors', 'OFDM']","['SiPM', 'SPAD', 'photon-counting', 'nonlinearity', 'machine learning', 'radial basis function neural network']"

In the case of a relatively small Auger recombination (<; C A = 5 × 10 -30 cm 6 s), the QW structure with a smaller In composition (x = 0.1) shows a larger hot/cold factor (IE T1 /IE T2 , with T 1 > T 2 ) than that with a larger In composition (x = 0.3) because the radiative recombination is dominant and the IE of the former is much larger than that of the latter. The hot/cold factors for QW structures with x = 0.1 and 0.3 are 0.85 and 0.71 at J = 100 A/cm 2 , respectively. On the other hand, in the case of a relatively large Auger recombination (> C A = 10 -28 cm 6 s), the hot/cold factor (0.69) of the QW structure with a larger In composition is found to be larger than that (0.62) with a smaller In composition. This is attributed to the fact that the Auger recombination is dominant even for the QW structure with a small In composition and that the difference of the IE between two different temperatures decreases with increasing x.","['Temperature', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Gallium nitride', 'Charge carrier density', 'Stimulated emission', 'Radiative recombination']","['Temperature droop', 'quantum well', 'light-emitting diode', 'GaN', 'InGaN']"

"In this paper, we report a new method to generate tunable high-repetition-rate temporal cavity solitons (TCSs) in a nonlinear fiber cavity, which is driven by dual Brillouin laser pulses. This method is more feasible than generating solitons via a continuous optical-driven nonlinear cavity because of the enhanced four-wave mixing process triggered by the high peak intensity Brillouin laser pulses. The generated TCSs lock to the beating signal arriving from dual Brillouin pulses, which allows the repetition rate of the solitons to be directly tuned all- optically. The TCSs can be continuously tuned over a repetition rate range of 140∼242 GHz by controlling the external dual-wavelength spacing, and the pulse duration can be accordingly adjusted from 0.9 ps to 513 fs. Such TCSs with tunable high-repetition-rate can provide a practical solution for the low-noise controllable millimeter-wave and terahertz sources.","['Pump lasers', 'Scattering', 'Optical pumping', 'Optical pulses', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical solitons', 'Fiber nonlinear optics']","['Dual pulse Brillouin laser', 'Kerr frequency comb', 'temporal cavity solitons', 'tuning mode spacing']"
"In this paper, we comparatively studied the energy band diagram and the cutoff wavelength characteristics of germanium-tin (GeSn) fin and pillar array detectors wrapped in a Si 3 N 4 liner stressor to unveil the impacts of tensile strain and device architecture in the absorption spectra of the devices. A large tensile strain is introduced into GeSn devices by the expansion of the Si 3 N 4 liner stressor. Compared to the fin detector, a larger tensile volume strain is demonstrated in the GeSn pillar architecture. With the tensile strain induced by the Si 3 N 4 liner stressor, the direct bandgap E G,Γ of GeSn is obviously shrinked by lowering the energy of the Γ conduction band valley, which results in a significant extension of absorption edge in the GeSn detectors. As the Si 3 N 4 liner stressor releases internal stress and expands, the absorption edge of the tensile-strained Ge 0.90 Sn 0.10 pillar array detector with the length of side of pillar L pillar of 100 nm is extended to 4.35 μm. With further improvement, the tensile-strained GeSn pillar architecture with the Si 3 N 4 liner stressor will be competitive for the application in 2-5-μm mid-infrared spectra.","['Detectors', 'Tin', 'Arrays', 'Photonic band gap', 'Tensile strain', 'Absorption']","['Germanium-tin', 'Detectors', 'Mid-infrared', 'Tensile strain', 'Liner stressor']"

"Modern-day diamond sorting is achieved through the application of X-ray luminescence (XRL) and X-ray transmission (XRT) techniques. Sorting with XRL is limited to the class range of 1.25 mm to 32 mm because of self-absorption associated with larger diamonds, greater than 32mm. The effect of self-absorption is also a high-energy phenomenon in XRL. XRT is limited to sorting large size diamonds as the technique suffers poor contrast for diamonds smaller than 10mm. XRT measurements are immune to self-absorption for all sample sizes, while XRL measurements have good contrast for particles smaller than 32mm. The applications of these techniques have hitherto been used independently of each other and have subsequently progressed mutually exclusively. Here we analytically show a new paradox of a dual-modality X-ray diamond sorting combining XRL and XRT techniques' strengths. Key features of our new paradoxical model performance are contrast mitigation for small particles and self-absorption rejection for a large particle at high energy as well as improved particle detectability and classification.","['Sorting', 'Diamond', 'Absorption', 'Detectors', 'Fluorescence', 'Licenses', 'Mathematical model']","['Luminescence', 'fluorescence', 'transmission', 'self-absorption', 'contrast', 'detectability']"

"In this article, energy efficient asymmetrically clipped frequency-shift keying (AC-FSK) based visible light communication (VLC) system is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. In order to facilitate straightforward comparison with the experimental results, theoretical expression for bit error probability, based on the Euclidean distance analysis of AC-FSK symbols, is provided. The VLC setup is based on commercial off-the-shelf components and software defined radio. The bit error rate (BER) performance of AC-FSK is evaluated considering maximum likelihood (ML) receiver, 1-tap discrete cosine transform (DCT) based receiver and frequency-domain harmonic receiver. Simulation and experimental results reveal that the performance of harmonic and ML receivers is almost identical. On the other hand, considering harmonic receiver for both AC-FSK and state-of-the-art unipolar (U)-FSK, we also gather that the BER performance of both schemes is almost the same. However, the harmonic receiver complexity of AC-FSK is 41.6% and 33.3% less compared to that of U-FSK for modulation order M = 16 and M = 128 , respectively. This is because unlike U-FSK, AC-FSK requires limited number of harmonics for its optimal operation.","['Frequency shift keying', 'Harmonic analysis', 'Receivers', 'Symbols', 'Frequency-domain analysis', 'Modulation', 'Euclidean distance']","['Frequency-shift keying', 'visible light comm- unication', 'intensity modulation and direct detection', 'energy efficient modulation']"

"Nanowire photonic crystal (PhC) structure is one of promising approaches to enhance vertical light extraction efficiency (LEE) of ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV LEDs). There are lots of investigations to study the structure of nanowire UV LEDs by using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The optimal LEE are obtained by using some optimization algorithms. However, it needs a broad window, not the best values of geometrical parameters of nanowires in practical fabrication. In this paper, the vertical LEE of UV LEDs are theoretically enhanced by selecting the band gaps of AlGaN-based nanowire PhC structure. It illustrates that all the gaps can inhibit the horizontal propagation of light. However, the inhibiting ability of Gap 1 are weaker than them of Gap 2 and Gap 3. The reason is that the radii of nanowires in Gap 1 are too small to support enough guided modes. As a comparison, both Gap 2 and Gap 3 can efficiently inhibit the radiated mode propagation, and finally enhance the vertical LEE. In addition, the variations of height, number, and refractive index of nanowires on vertical LEE and optical band gaps are discussed.

Under a real experimental condition where the incident power is 75 mW, the source-detector distance is 1.0 cm, and the full width at half maxima of the IRF is 160 ps, we used simulation experiments to investigate the relationship between the contrast of the intensity autocorrelation function (g 2 ) in two brain functional states (i.e., baseline and activation) and TD-DCS system parameters (including L C , IRF, source-detector distance, gate opening time and gate width).Our simulation results show that both longer L C and longer integration time are beneficial to a more sensitive detection. With a fixed L C and integration time, the optimal parameters of gate opening time is 800 ps (relative to the peak time of IRF), and gate width is equal to or larger than 800 ps.

"A wavelength division (de)multiplexing (WDM) filter with ultra-low channel crosstalk (XT) and high tolerance was proposed for a 1 × 4 O-band coarse-WDM (CWDM) system on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI). The filter consists of four waveguide Bragg grating (WBG) structures, each one having a multi-mode waveguide and corrugations at both waveguide side walls. To relax the critical dimension, low-material-index silicon nitride (SiN _{x} ) was utilized instead of silicon. For efficient design of each SiN _{x} multi-mode WBG (MMWBG), the core and corrugation widths were engineered over the perturbed-permittivity coupled-mode theory, leading to an ultra-high side-lobe suppression ratio > 25.3 dB. The overall CWDM filter offers flat-top responses with ultra-low excess losses (ELs) < 0.6 dB, a high channel uniformity >- 0.45 dB, broad 1-dB bandwidths (BWs) \sim 13.45 nm, ultra-low XTs < - 28 dB, and ultra-broad available bandwidths of 14.35 nm for XTs < - 28 dB (ABW _{28-} dB \sim 14.35 nm).

"We report a wavelength-switchable single-polarization dissipative soliton (DS) mode-locked fiber laser using a chirped fiber Bragg grating (FBG) for spectral filtering. The chirped FBG, when inserted into the ring cavity, provides a stopband from 1045 nm to 1057 nm, which is used for spectral filtering in this all-normal-dispersion mode-locked Yb-doped fiber laser. The combination of the chirped FBG and the Yb gain profile help the formation of the DS.

"Reflective Fourier ptychographic microscopy has much potential for industrial surface inspection due to the ability to overcome the physical limits of the numerical aperture of the optical microscopy. However, the time cost for misalignment calibration and Fourier ptychography (FP) recovery has been a big issue for industrial applications which require fast output. Here, we introduce a misalignment estimation method which is accelerated through the whale optimization algorithm by running in parallel on Central Processing Units (CPUs), named pWOA, to reduce computing time. The proposed method shows more accurate and faster calibration compared to other population-based algorithms, including the parallel genetic algorithm and the parallel particle swarm optimization, and much faster than that of the exhaustive search both in simulations and in real experiments. In addition, this cost-effective technique can address global non-convex optimization problems with heavy loss functions including reflective FP.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Optimization', 'Whale optimization algorithms', 'Statistics', 'Sociology', 'Parallel processing', 'Mirrors']","['Microscopy', 'technologies for computing', 'other imaging technique']"

"The triple-band (S+C+L) transmission system using only C-band transceivers and all-optical wavelength conversions (AOWCs) without S- and L-band optical transceivers have been proposed. Although an AOWC employs highly nonlinear fibers, it is not applicable to photonic integrated circuits (PICs). For a device with successful wavelength conversion, a silicon-rich nitride (SRN) waveguide provides superior performance, as it is applicable to PIC and facilitates a higher Kerr nonlinearity than conventional stoichiometric silicon nitride waveguides. Thus, in this study, we propose an all-optical simultaneous wavelength conversion method that can be cost-effectively fabricated on a PIC based on four-wave mixing in SRN waveguides. Following an explanation regarding the design of an SRN waveguide for wideband AOWC, the successful operation of a double-stage AOWC of 64-channel 64-Gb/s QPSK signals between the C+L bands and the S-band is demonstrated, which is useful for wideband transmission systems.","['Phase shift keying', 'Optical wavelength conversion', 'Photonic integrated circuits', 'Silicon nitride', 'Wavelength division multiplexing', 'Transceivers', 'Optical fiber devices']","['All-optical signal processing', 'optical fiber communication', 'silicon photonics', 'wavelength conversion', 'wavelength-division multiplexing']"

"Structured Light Illumination Microscopy (SIM) has proved itself as a very effective method to improve the resolution of a widefield (WF) fluorescent microscope. In this paper, we demonstrate a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) imaging with the SIM, using a moving fringe (MF) illumination pattern. Instead of the standard three-beam standing wave illumination pattern, our method requires a two-beam one, varying along the optical axis. Each axial layer of the MF illumination pattern contains single-spatial-frequency interference fringes, traversing the space with its own speed (temporal frequency), proportional to the axial offset of such layer from the excitation plane. The different axial layers of a fluorescent object, excited with the MF illumination, will emit a continuous amplitude modulated fluorescent signal with the frequency of modulation proportional to the temporal frequency of the moving fringe pattern. The fine 3D image reconstruction is achieved via extracting the spatial location of the fluorescent object from the temporal frequency of amplitude modulated signal emitted by it. Since in our approach the problem of 3D image reconstruction is reduced to the problem of accurate temporal frequency estimation, any of the well-known spectrum estimation techniques can be applied to the problem, allowing the axial resolution improvement far beyond the limits of the classical 3D SIM. In this research, we suggest using the Minimum-norm method for the proposed MF SIM system, which gives a superior resolving power in spectrum estimation. Simulation results show that such a simple and rapid hardware implementation in combination with a straightforward signal processing method can, however, deliver an improvement in axial resolution far beyond the classical 3D SIM approach.","['Lighting', 'Three-dimensional displays', 'Image resolution', 'Microscopy', 'Gratings', 'Spatial resolution', 'Fluorescence']","['Super-resolution 3D imaging', 'structural light illumination', 'Minimum-norm spectrum estimation']"

"Progress in epitaxial design is shown to enable increased optical output power P opt and power conversion efficiency η E and decreased lateral far-field divergence angle in GaAs-based distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) broad-area (BA) diode lasers. We show that the wavelength-locked power can be significantly increased (saturation at high bias current is mitigated) by migrating from an asymmetric large optical cavity (ASLOC) based laser structure to a highly asymmetric (extreme-triple-asymmetric (ETAS)) layer design. For wavelength-stabilization, 7 th order, monolithic DBRs are etched on the surface of fully grown epitaxial layer structures. The investigated ETAS reference Fabry-Pérot (FP) BA lasers without DBRs and with 200 µm stripe width and 4 mm cavity length provide P opt = 29 W (still increasing) at 30 A in continuous-wave mode at room temperature, in contrast to the maximum P opt = 24 W (limited by strong power saturation) of baseline ASLOC lasers. The reference ETAS FP lasers also deliver over 10% higher η E at P opt = 24 W. On the other hand, in comparison to the wavelength-stabilized ASLOC DBR lasers, ETAS DBR lasers show a peak power increment from 14 W to 22 W, and an efficiency increment from 46% to 60% at P opt = 14 W. A narrow spectral width (< 1 nm at 95% power content) is maintained across a very wide operating range.

"This paper presents a novel camera simulation framework capable of simulating the optical path of a variety of camera systems through the technique of Monte Carlo Path tracing. Path tracer is a ray-tracing technique that uses Markov chains to solve the global illumination problem, i.e., the problem of calculating the distribution of light in an environment, taking into account all forms of scattering, absorption, and interreflection. In global illumination, we deal with the interaction of light that reaches a surface directly from a light source (direct lighting) as well as the interaction of light that reaches a surface as a result of scattering or transmission from or through other objects (indirect lighting). Available pieces of ray-tracer software use very simple models for their camera system like the pinhole camera, the thin-lens camera, and the thick-lens camera.

"Visible light communication (VLC) based on image sensor (IS) as the receiver is one of the supplementary technologies of radio frequency communication. By combining with image processing technology, VLC has various applications in smart home, underwater communication and intelligent transportation system (ITS). In the paper, it focuses on the vehicle positioning service provided by VLC in ITS. For the weak image spatial separability caused by long-distance VLC transmission between the vehicle and the infrastructure, it will lead to serious deterioration in communication and positioning performance. Thus, a deep learning-assisted IS-based visible light positioning (VLP) scheme is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. At the transmitter, a novel coding method is proposed to support both short-distance and long-distance communication based on VLC in ITS. Meanwhile, it can meet the dimming requirements of LED road infrastructure. In addition, in the proposed VLP scheme, it uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the location of the vehicle.

"A novel method to extract the grating coupling coefficient of distributed feedback (DFB) lasers by comparing the theoretical and experimental values of the side mode spacing is demonstrated.

"Circadian stimulus ( CS ) is a popular metric for evaluating circadian effects of light. However, the determination of its value is complicated. In this work, the possibility of developing a simplified model to accurately estimate CS values has been investigated. It is found that: i) the CS 2018 model itself has an important limitation: a very small perturbation in spectrum could result in a significant change in CS value, which fundamentally limits the development of a simplified model based on photometric or colorimetric inputs. ii) such a limitation is effectively reduced by the latest CS 2021 model, and therefore a simplified model can be developed to estimate the value of CS 2021 based on illuminance, correlated color temperature, a constraint of color rending index, and the factors of the continuous light exposure duration t and the spatial distribution of circadian light exposure f . The simplified model is developed and validated by using a comprehensive data set containing 395923 lighting spectra. The small deviations in CS value, which is less than 0.087 and 0.052 for warm and cool white light sources, respectively, show that the proposed simplified model could serve as an accurate and convenient tool for practical circadian lighting design.","['Measurement', 'Lighting', 'Sensitivity', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Indexes', 'Pigments', 'Mathematical models']","['Circadian metric', 'non-visual effect', 'circadian stimulus', 'spectral power distribution', 'circadian lighting']"

"A slot micro/nano optical fiber with elliptical low-index core, referred to as the elliptical-slot micro/nano fiber (ESMNF), is studied systematically in great detail in this paper. It is demonstrated that the ESMNF can confine most of the light in the low-index region and hence lead to large field enhancement. Benefiting from the large low-index power confinement factor and the field enhancement, the ESMNF also yields significant nonlinearity enhancement by the proper selection of materials. In addition, large birefringence between the two fundamental polarized modes is observed, due to the breakage of the circular symmetry for the core. The nonlinearity and low-index confinement properties of a more practical elliptical-slot embedded suspended microstructure fiber are also studied.","['Materials', 'Indexes', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical refraction', 'Optical variables control', 'Refractive index']","['Fiber optics', 'fiber design and fabrication', 'nonlinear optics', 'fibers']"
"A stable and tunable linear-polarization fiber ring laser with a high side-mode-suppression ratio (SMSR) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated by using a compounded fiber filter, which is composed of a dual-pass Mach-Zehnder interferometer filter incorporating one segment of polarization-maintaining fiber and a high finesse filter. By adjusting the polarization controllers, the output laser can be tuned from 1560.37 to 1568.56 nm and an SMSR as high as 72 dB is achieved. In addition, the peak power fluctuation and wavelength shift are monitored to be less than 0.08 dB and 0.02 nm over an hour. Due to the introduction of the compounded fiber filter as a wavelength selector, the side mode of lasing output can be effectively suppressed and mode competition can be weakened. As a result, the SMSR of lasing output is increased and power stability is improved.","['Optical fiber filters', 'Ring lasers', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Laser stability']","['Compounded fiber filter', 'fiber laser', 'high SMSR', 'linear-polarization', 'stable tunable']"

This configuration is able to mimic the real structure of remote-phosphor-based WLEDs. A comparison between the transmission- and traditional reflection-type measurements have also been carried out. Results show that the LCE and EQE are lower for the former than for the latter. Reasons are due to part of directly detected reflective blue lights and re-absorption of the blue light by the phosphor plate. Furthermore, by using the transmission-type system, optical properties of phosphor-plate samples with different thicknesses and different mass ratios of the mixture are analyzed under various current levels.

Benefitting from varying the pump direction rather than the cavity axis, the OPO cavity was unaffected so that the stability of the output signal energy and beam direction could be maintained, which greatly facilitates subsequent applications.

We polished a large angle on the fiber terminal facet in the sample arm to make a non-rotational symmetric beam with different numerical apertures (NA) for the two axes vertical to the optical axis. By sacrificing the resolution in the out-of-plane transverse direction, the elliptical beam mitigated the aberration introduced by the focusing optics in the OCT system. The elliptical beam with a doubled NA in the in-plane transverse direction promoted the axial field-of-view (FOV) by about 50% and increased the signal back-coupling efficiency by about 25%.

"The noise suppression of high-resolution range profile (HRRP) is a prerequisite for Geiger-mode of avalanche photodiodes (GM-APD) lidar to achieve precise sensing. However, it is difficult to balance the suppression effect and the integrity of detailed information. Considering this problem, we propose a Bayesian network-based improved loop filter (BNILF) for abnormal noise suppression. Based on the ILF, the Bayesian non-average local filtering model is established to calculate a distance of Pearson distance, which gives the criterion of noise judgment. Furthermore, the block preselection is used to accelerate identify abnormal noise and complete range profile noise suppression. To evaluate the performance of this algorithm, simulation and physical system experiments are carried out. The results show that the proposed algorithm has a better noise suppression effect and a higher detailed information protection ability in comparison with the existing typical approaches.","['Noise reduction', 'Filtering algorithms', 'Information filters', 'Bayes methods', 'Machine learning algorithms', 'Laser radar', 'Licenses']","['Range profile noise suppression', 'detail protection', 'intelligent filtering', 'Bayesian network', 'fast calculation']"
"Reflective-type Fourier ptychographic microscopy, an outstanding solution for surface inspection, employs a phase retrieval algorithm to reconstruct a high-resolution image with a wide field-of-view. This technique is time-consuming because it requires processing a large number of low-resolution images coming from the dark-field illuminator and bright-field illuminator. To decrease the computation time, we propose a new Fourier ptychography recovery method running in parallel in a graphics processing unit. We also utilized an adaptive step-size incremental gradient descent searching algorithm. The approach was validated by measuring a USAF reflective resolution target and by inspecting the surface of a smartphone integrated circuit.

"Simultaneously high quality-factor ( Q ) and transmission ( T ) are highly desired in various optical, photonic, and optoelectronic applications such as filters, sensors, photodetectors and lasers. However, a trade-off between high Q and high T exists widely in optical systems thanks to the different physics triggers underneath. Here, as an example, we experimentally demonstrate a Bragg filter composed of niobium pentoxide (Nb _2 O _5 ) and silica (SiO _2 ) stacks which enable high Q of 183 and high T of 91.3%. Balancing dissipation and radiation rate of the optical system is crucial to the performance of the device, which is validated by modulating the absorption of material (Nb _2 O _5 ) and the number of stacks. Further, with the principle the tunable Bragg filter is able to work in a similar way at optical wavelengths, i.e., maintaining almost unchanged FWHM (full width at half-maximum) and T values.

"Many previous VO 2 -based perfect metamaterial absorbers can enhance light-matter interaction when VO 2 is in metal phase but with weak light-matter interaction when VO 2 is in insulator phase.

"An omni-azimuth angle sensor for tilt measuring based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) array is proposed. It is designed based on the sensitivity of FBG to axial traction. The sensor consists of a mass block and a cube frame connected by an FBG array. The FBG array consists of four FBGs. When the sensor is tilted at different angles, the axial traction of each FBG will change due to the pull of the mass block.

Mode conversion can be achieved in multimode waveguides using optical analogy of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. The coupled mode equations (CMEs) for adiabatic mode conversion via an intermediate mode with wavelength detunings are derived for an engineered step-index multimode waveguide. It is shown that the detunings cause diabatic coupling of adiabatic modes and result in lowered conversion efficiency. The Landau-Zener (LZ) model of nonadiabatic crossing is used to analyze the spectral response of the mode converters and shown to be in good agreement with numerical solutions of the CMEs and beam propagation simulations. The analytical expressions from the LZ analysis offer useful insight into the spectral properties of the mode converters and suggest bandwidth tunability of these devices. We demonstrate bandwidth tunability of the mode converter by a numerical example.,"['Optical waveguides', 'Couplings', 'Mathematical model', 'Bandwidth', 'Numerical models', 'Analytical models']","['Waveguides', 'theory and design', 'waveguide devices']"
"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), confirmed as an efficient technique, has been applied in optical wireless communications (OWCs) to improve the transmission rate. However, the disadvantage of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) also brings into the OWC systems, especially for multi-user communications, resulting in low power efficiency. This paper proposes beam domain MIMO-OFDM OWCs with PAPR reduction. We describe the MIMO-OFDM OWC system architecture and derive the achievable sum rate and PAPR for multi-user OFDM systems, which are dominated by the precoding vectors. To reduce the PAPR, we design the precoding vectors to maximize the sum rate under the PAPR constraint. We propose an iterative process to obtain a candidate optimal solution by the sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method. Furthermore, we prove that the PAPR increases with the number of users and propose a low complexity beam scheduling and power allocation algorithm. Numerical results validate that the proposed schemes can efficiently improve the transmission rate and reduce the PAPR.","['Peak to average power ratio', 'Precoding', 'Optical beams', 'Wireless communication', 'High-speed optical techniques', 'Optical distortion', 'Time-domain analysis']","['MIMO-OFDM', 'PAPR reduction', 'multi-user optical wireless communications', 'beam domain']"

However, the bending-induced mode distortion will change the TMI coefficient and influences the TMI threshold. In this work, we analyzed the bending effects on the mode profiles by inducing different refractive index tilts corresponding to different bending radii. With these mode profiles and with different bending conditions, a modified TMI coefficient was calculated to analyze the bending effects on TMI for different fibers.

The detection and wavelength recognition of trichromatic light are accomplished by the photoreceptors with RGB filters. The ASC, fabricated in a standard CMOS technology, activates the competition among photoreceptors to select the principal color-component feature defined as the attentional focus. The number of focuses and resolution can be changed with a top-down stimulus. Electrical test results show that the ASC can select and interpret the most important color-component feature.

"Compared with conventional lenses, metalenses can offer smaller form factor, light weight and new functionality, and have become the focus of the recent investigations of metasurface. To date, quite a lot of studies have been reported for chromatic aberration correction of metalenses. Noting most work was carried out to satisfy the required group delay or dispersion by introducing sophisticated and integrated nanopillars, which are obtained using computationally intensive global search algorithms. Generally, the design is time-consuming.

Analytical expressions of the outage probability and average bit error rate (ABER) are obtained with the help of state transition matrix. The average packet delay of the system is also evaluated with the help of obtained outage probability. The performance of the considered system is analyzed for different values of K and L . The performance is then further compared with the non-buffer-aided (NBA) cooperative relaying for FSO communication systems and it has been observed that the proposed buffer-aided FSO system significantly outperforms the NBA FSO systems for entire range of turbulence.

"Wavelength-division-multiplexed passive optical network (WDM-PON) has been widely deployed for the high-speed, reliable transmission and low-cost properties. The physical layer identity authentication in WDM-PON becomes increasingly prominent. Recently, many device fingerprint based identity authentication schemes are proposed. However, these schemes only realize constant fingerprint, which will be acquired by illegal ONU after optical spectrum analysis. Therefore, the higher-level security requirement cannot be satisfied. To solve the problem, we propose a physical layer identity authentication method in WDM-PON by exploiting the channel characteristics based adjustable fingerprint with deep neural networks (DNNs). By secretly negotiating with legal optical network units (ONUs) on the lengths of the local fibers applied by them, the optical line terminal (OLT) can acquire the unique channel characteristics fingerprint obtained by each legal ONU. It should be noted that the fingerprint can be adjusted by modifying the length of the local fiber. Moreover, the same number of DNNs as legal ONUs are trained for fingerprint identification. Simulation results show 100% identification accuracy for illegal ONU when the length deviation between two fibers applied by legal ONU and illegal ONU is greater than 1.5 km.

"Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM), an emerging computational imaging technology, can realize wide-field and high-resolution simultaneously and thus achieves great success in biomedical fields. The computational imaging process, however, also accumulates various but inevitable noises into measurements. Conventional deep based reconstruction methods simply ignore the existence of noise and integrate all features from measurements for prediction, which severely degrades the quality of reconstructed images. To mitigate this issue, we present a novel network, dubbed DeUnet, that adaptively filters out noise during reconstruction through a new cross-level channel attention mechanism. Specifically, DeUnet comprises of three key stages: encoding, denoising and decoding. The encoding stage abstracts hierarchical features from input measurements. The denoising stage learns to re-calibrate channel-wise feature responses from multiple levels in a collaborative manner. It selectively highlights informative channels while suppressing noisy ones by exploiting long-range dependencies among features across multiple resolutions. The decoding stage integrates denoised features to reconstruct final intensity and phase images. Extensive experiments on both the simulated and real data well demonstrate the effectiveness of DeUnet in suppressing noise. In particular, DeUnet can produce reconstruction results of higher quality and more valuable details, especially for phase images, compared to previous state-of-the-arts.","['Image reconstruction', 'Feature extraction', 'Image resolution', 'Licenses', 'Noise measurement', 'Pupils', 'Optical variables measurement']","['Fourier ptychographic microscopy', 'image reconstruction', 'neural network', 'channel attention mechanism']"

"Although surface plasmon resonance (SPR) antennas have been integrated into CMOS THz detectors as an alternative to the traditional radio-wave antenna, spatial crosstalk of SPR antenna in detector arrays remains an issue and there is little study in this field. In this paper, a CMOS THz detector array at 0.65 THz with on-chip SPR antennas is designed in standard CMOS technology and the pixel crosstalk related to the SPR antenna parameters are investigated. Simulation results show that the adjacent SPR antenna spacing significantly affect the antenna crosstalk due to the surface wave propagation. To suppress the pixel crosstalk, the adjacent SPR antenna spacing is designed as 1.65 times larger than half of the antenna size. Under the condition, the S12 parameter between the adjacent antennas is reduced to -15 dB. High antenna isolation can be further available by the increase of the isolation layer thickness of the pixel up to 1 μm. Based on the simulation results, a 1×16 THz detector array at 0.65THz was fabricated. The experimental results show that the pixels in the array achieve uniform NEP , with an average value of about 32.6 pW/Hz 0.5 and a standard deviation coefficient of about 9.6%.

"High resolution imaging techniques will play an essential role in the future smart imaging applications to provide potential solutions for accurate detection, monitoring and classification of the target. The potential of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems to acquire high resolution images has opened new frontiers and led to its exploration in new applications. The conventional microwave radar imaging suffers limited range resolution in the sub-millimeter wave range and optical imaging methods are constrained by the diffraction limit. In the terahertz (THz) regime of the spectrum, the SAR systems could be operated in all the weather, all the time and are capable of penetrating through clouds, smoke, dust etc. to achieve high resolution images beyond the diffraction limit. The curved SAR presents a SAR system created by circularly encircling the target scene. The Circular SAR and Spiral SAR which are based on a circular and cylindrical spiral scanning trajectory, respectively are the scanning methods used for curved SAR. In this paper, we have explored a new toolbox that enables the rapid development of near-field THz-SAR imaging systems and generation of large near-field THz imaging scenarios with the goal to support and facilitate data driven research such as deep learning in the THz community through synthetically generated SAR images as well as its potential for THz based high resolution and 2D/3D near-field imaging application. Initially, the potential advantages of THz-SAR over Microwave SAR and optical imaging methods are presented. Further, a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar testbed is simulated in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) configuration for the target frequency band. Moreover, the circular and cylindrical SAR scanning methods are explored for near-field imaging of point targets to obtain 2D and 3D THz-SAR images, respectively. Also, the radar images are reconstructed using the Back Propagation and Polar Formatting Algorithms, focusing on short range applications like indoor environments. Finally, the SAR performance evaluation metrics are reported and a roadmap for future work is presented.","['Imaging', 'Synthetic aperture radar', 'Radar imaging', 'Image resolution', 'Microwave theory and techniques', 'Microwave imaging', 'Radar']","['Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)', 'THz imaging', 'circular SAR', 'cylindrical SAR', '2D and 3D imaging', 'near-field', 'radar image reconstruction', 'high resolution imaging', 'reconstruction algorithms', 'MIMO', 'FMCW']"
"A D-shaped fiber-optic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor with MXene (Ti3C2Tx) is proposed as the sensing enhancement material. A spin coating method was used to cover the gold film D-shaped fiber SPR sensor with a layer of MXene.

"In recent years, Kramers-Kronig (KK) receiver has been widely studied because of its simple structure and the ability of digital signal processing (DSP) to recover complex value signals. One practical structure is detecting the optical signal with an AC-coupled photodetector. However, the direct current (DC) component of the photocurrent will be lost, in which case the KK algorithm ceases to be effective. To restore the lost DC component, we propose a simple data-aided method to estimate the DC component by the information of signal mean power stored in the designed data-aided sequences. We introduce a correction coefficient to evaluate the accuracy of our DC estimation by comparing it to the conventional DC sweeping method. Furthermore, the coefficient can be used to combat the DC estimation deviation. We carry out both simulations and experiments to study the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the DC component can be effectively recovered and the system performance is close to the results of the DC sweeping method. At the same time, in the case of low optical signal-to-noise ratio, optimization of correction coefficient can effectively improve the system performance.","['Estimation', 'Optical noise', 'Photoconductivity', 'Payloads', 'Optical receivers', 'System performance', 'Signal to noise ratio']","['Kramers-Kronig receiver', 'digital signal processing']"
"An equivalently discrete coupling coefficient (EDCC) distributed feedback (DFB) semiconductor laser with EDCC grating is numerically investigated and experimentally demonstrated; the EDCC grating structure is designed by discretizing the duty cycle of sampled Bragg grating along the laser cavity, i.e., the cavity is divided into some subsections, and the duty cycle is constant in each subsection while it is different between two adjacent subsections, instead of the truly discrete coupling coefficient grating profile realized by discontinuously varying the duty cycle and/or etching depth of the uniform gating pitch. Moreover, the EDCC grating is fabricated by combining the conventional holographic exposure with a micrometer-level photolithography, which will simplify the fabrication process and reduce the fabrication cost. Based on experimental data, the analysis of spectral behavior as a function of injection current shows that the stable single-longitudinal-mode operation has been realized, even at large injection current and high temperature.","['Gratings', 'Semiconductor lasers', 'Laser modes', 'Cavity resonators', 'Couplings', 'Measurement by laser beam']","['Discrete coupling coefficient', 'semiconductor lasers', 'distributed-feedback', 'single longitudinal mode operation']"

"In recent years, the toroidal dipoles have had a profound impact on several fields including electromagnetism. However, the on-demand design of toroidal metasurfaces is still a very time-consuming process. In this paper, a method of neural network simulating the nonlinear relationship between the structural parameters of metasurfaces and its multipole scattered powers is proposed based on a deep learning algorithm. The forward network can quickly predict the scattered powers from input structural parameters, which can achieve an accuracy comparable to the electromagnetic simulations. In addition, with the required scattering spectrum as input, the appropriate parameters of the structure could be automatically calculated and then output by the inverse network which can achieve a low mean square error of 0.074 in training set and 0.18 in the test set.

"High control bandwidth is usually restricted in a photoelectric tracking system (PTS) based on a Charge-Couple Device(CCD) with time delay, which hinders a good tracking performance. Generally, a model-based delay-compensation controller called Smith predictor (SP) can help increase the controller gain to promote the bandwidth by separating delay from the control loop. However, the performance promotion is insufficient because the delay still stays in the forward channel which causes errors between output and input. And the increase of the controller gain is still limited due to the effect of model mismatch on stability. In this paper, to solve the problems, a delay-compound-compensation control (DCCC) based on improved SP by trajectory prediction and velocity feedforward is proposed. The additional trajectory prediction is used to further eliminate the effect of delay existing in the forward channel. The additional velocity feedforward is used to further reform the transfer characteristics limited by the controller gain. A Kalman filter-based design method of trajectory prediction is presented and the optimal design principle of feedback and feedforward controllers is given in the face of model mismatch. Experiments demonstrate that the DCCC is valid and could greatly promote the tracking performance in the low frequency.","['Delays', 'Trajectory', 'Feedforward systems', 'Bandwidth', 'Target tracking', 'Predictive models', 'Performance evaluation']","['Smith predictor', 'time delay', 'charge-couple device', 'delay-compound-compensation', 'trajectory prediction', 'velocity feedforward']"

In addition, for high order modulation, the demultiplexing performance of MBD is better than the equalization methods. So our results suggest that MBD should be an effective demultiplexing method and even a good candidate for equalization methods for high-order modulation formats.","['Couplings', 'Demultiplexing', 'Algorithm design and analysis', 'Convergence', 'Heuristic algorithms', 'Finite impulse response filters', 'Time-domain analysis']","['Mode-division multiplexing (MDM)', 'demultiplexing', 'hannel blind deconvolution (MBD)']"

"In this paper, we present the design guidelines for a tunable optical isolator in an SOI-based ring resonator with two small time-modulated regions. By considering a physical model, the proper geometrical and modulation parameters are designed, based on a standard CMOS foundry process. The effect of the variation of the key parameters on the performance of the isolator is explained by two counter-acting mechanisms, namely the separation between the resonance frequencies of counter-rotating modes and energy transfer to the side harmonic. We show that there is a trade-off between these parameters to obtain maximum isolation. Consequently, by applying the quadrature phase difference one can obtain the maximum separation between the resonance frequencies and hence the minimum insertion loss, while the maximum isolation is obtained at the modulation phase difference of -0.78\pi , which leads to a higher insertion loss. Robustness of the design is investigated through a sensitivity analysis for the fabrication variations in the distance and width of the modulated regions. We demonstrate that there is a trade-off between isolation and insertion loss, and by varying the modulation parameters, we can achieve isolation of 18 (5) dB with 7 (1.8) dB insertion loss.","['Optical ring resonators', 'Optical modulation', 'Optical device fabrication', 'Isolators', 'Silicon', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Optical interferometry']","['Non-reciprocity', 'photonic integrated circuits', 'time-modulated silicon ring resonator']"

"A dual-output microwave photonic frequency up- and down-converter using a 90° optical hybrid without filtering is proposed. By using a dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator and a Mach-Zehnder modulator in parallel to realize carrier suppressed single sideband and carrier suppressed double sideband modulation, respectively, with a 90° optical hybrid and 90° electrical hybrid coupler, this scheme can implement two functions: simultaneous up- and down-conversion signal generation, or high image rejection in down-conversion.

"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access Passive Optical Networks (OFDMA-PONs), a solution for the next-generation optical access network, allows multiple optical network units (ONUs) to dynamically share subcarriers (SCs) to support efficient bandwidth allocation. In uplink transmission, multiple ONUs can share orthogonal low bit rate SCs to transmit data at different time slots (TSs) during the transmission cycle. In this paper, the dynamic subcarrier allocation (DSA) scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed for various ONU bandwidth requests. The novel scheme jointly allocates time slots, subcarriers, and modulation formats in a dynamic and flexible manner. The ONU can save transmit power by using a lower order modulation format while meeting the delay requirement. The simulation part demonstrates how the proposed DRL-based DSA scheme can be adapted to various situations, including 1) variation in the size of ONU bandwidth requests, and 2) variation in the weight of different indicators. The extensive simulation results show that, for the first time, the proposed DRL-based DSA algorithm achieves optimal traffic latency with substantial power saving, compared with the traditional two-dimensional DSA algorithms.","['Optical network units', 'Modulation', 'Passive optical networks', 'Delays', 'Bandwidth', 'Resource management', 'OFDM']","['Energy-saving', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'dynamic subcarrier assignment (DBA)', 'orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access passive optical network (OFDMA- PON)']"
"We investigate the spectral and amplification characteristics of Bi/Er co-doped fiber (BEDF) and Er-doped fiber (EDF), prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD). BEDF features a noise figure (NF) below 5.2 dB, the bandwidth with NF less than 4 dB is approximately 23 nm (1560–1583 nm), and that with a gain exceeding 25 dB is approximately 42 nm (1525–1567 nm). The quantum conversion efficiency (QCE) of BEDF at 1550 nm is 72.1% at a pump power of 300 mW. The saturated output power of BEDF at 1550 nm is 21.4 dBm. Raman spectra indicate that the maximum phonon energy of BEDF is lower than that of EDF. The fluorescence lifetime of the BEDF is 11.64 ms, which is longer than that of the EDF. These results show that co-doping with Bi ions could increase the fluorescence lifetime of Er 3+ , reduce the NF, and improve the QCE and saturated output power.

"Variation of leakage current in interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with different carrier concentrations achieved by coating the facet with antireflections (AR) coating was experimentally studied. Single-layer Al2O3 and double-layer ZnS-YF3, ZnS-SiO2, and Ti2O5-SiO2 AR coatings are applied to midinfrared (mid-IR) ICL devices to achieve reflectance ranging from 0.15 to 7 × 10 -4 . By monitoring the laser performance before and after coating, it was observed that, for lower reflectivity coatings, the leakage current appreciably rises with increasing carrier concentration, thus diminishing the slope efficiency improvements and, in fact, degrading the slope efficiency at very low reflectance. It was observed that the ratio of leakage to threshold current could increase by 17% for high carrier concentrations at very low AR coating values. The results also allow for experimental optimization of AR coatings for increased slope efficiency in mid-IR ICLs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an optimal value for the AR coatings in order to maximize the power in ICLs.","['Coatings', 'Quantum cascade lasers', 'Reflectivity', 'Threshold current', 'Materials', 'Indexes', 'Optical waveguides']","['Interband cascade lasers', 'anti-reflection coatings', 'slope efficiency']"
"The transverse spin and orbital-to-spin angular momentum conversion during strong focusing of light beams have attracted wide interest due to the novel physics behind and their broad potential applications. In this work, we study the effect of incident beam’s degree of polarization on the localized spin density of a tightly focused field. By modulating the correlation strength between two orthogonally polarized vortex modes of the incident beam, we find that the magnitude of the focal-plane transverse spin density component changes only slightly, while its spatial shape becomes an isotropic spin vortex with the decrease of the incident degree of polarization. Whereas, the longitudinal spin density, induced by the vortex phase, reduces its magnitude significantly with the decrease of incident beam’s degree of polarization. The behavior of the focal-plane spin density is interpreted with the two-dimensional degrees of polarization among the tightly focused field components. Furthermore, we explore the roles of the topological charge on enhancing the longitudinal spin density for unpolarized incident beam. Our results reveal the feasibility of spin-orbit interaction with partially polarized or even completely unpolarized light, such as the thermal light.","['Orbits', 'Lenses', 'Focusing', 'Polarization', 'Optical vortices', 'Correlation', 'Optical polarization']","['Degree of polarization', 'optical vortex', 'spin density', 'spin-orbit interaction of light', 'tight focusing']"

"Based on the coupling mode theory and numerical simulation, intramode-group coupling in orbital angular momentum (OAM) fibers with elliptical deformation is analyzed in depth. The elliptical deformation not only introduces a time delay difference between even and odd modes of the same high-order vector mode but also destroys the structure of the high-order vector modes; the structural damage depends on the strength of the elliptical deformation. When the elliptical deformation is relatively small, the structural damage of high-order vector modes can be ignored and coupling can be thought as occurring only between two OAM modes composed of the same high-order vector mode. While the elliptical deformation becomes larger, the structural damage cannot be ignored, coupling appears among four OAM modes in the same OAM mode group, and the coupling between two OAM modes composed of the same high-order vector mode is more serious. The results will pave the way for the establishment of accurate propagation models and the optimization of the OAM fiber design.","['Couplings', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Strain', 'Optical fiber theory', 'Indexes', 'Optical fiber dispersion', 'Optical fiber networks']","['Optical fiber communication', 'mode division multiplexing (MDM)', 'orbital angular momentum (OAM)', 'mode coupling']"

"Modulation classification (MC) has become a widely used technology, which is of great value in both commercial and civil applications. It actually completes the classification task of modulation signal through various means. In recent years, modulation format recognition based on deep learning (DL) has achieved great success. However, in practical application, the computational cost and model complexity have become the biggest obstacles of the traditional MC based on DL. To solve this problem, we propose complementary folding algorithm (CFA). This is an algorithm based on classical modulation classification (CMC), which folds and splices the features of the input neural network (NN), so that these features have both large-scale and small-scale dual branch receptive fields. The research results prove that under the same network structure and data quantity, both the correctness rate and the convergence speed of CFA are significantly improved in the communication experiment based on underwater visible light communication (UVLC). It is also worth mentioning that because of the particularity and complexity of the channel, UVLC system can be divided into different regions. In any region, CFA performs better than CMC, so we can prove that this algorithm also has excellent robustness.","['Modulation', 'Artificial neural networks', 'Constellation diagram', 'Complexity theory', 'Feature extraction', 'Classification algorithms', 'Information science']","['Classical modulation classification (CMC)', 'complementary folding algorithm (CFA)', 'neural network (NN)', 'Underwater visible light communication (UVLC)']"

In the decryption process, the generated meta-hologram is illuminated by a plane wave and an electric field across the LC layer is applied to superimpose the reconstructed holographic patterns, thus we could acquire the secret image. Therefore, the decryption method can be flexibly and sufficiently adjusted with applied field under monitorable condition.

"The feasibility of using InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well light-emitting diode arrays (LED arrays) as photodiodes (PDs) is investigated experimentally in addition to their light emitting function. Two discrete LED arrays are produced from one 4 × 4 LED array with a parallel-connected pixel configuration. Such compact designs are useful for light emission or detection at the transmitting/receiving terminals of optical wireless communication systems. Despite 4 × 2 LED arrays achieving a light output power of 67.4 mW at 250 mA, they exhibit an optical responsivity (detectivity) of 0.183 A/W (1.61 × 10 12 cm Hz 1/2 W -1 ) under ultraviolet light illumination (λ = 380 nm) at zero bias. For 4 × 2 LED arrays, the presence of an appreciable ultraviolet light response, together with a high 3-dB bandwidth (~8 MHz) for modulated light detection, allowed us to build a 15 Mbit/s directed optical link with these LEDs functioning as both the optical transmitter and the receiver. Finally, the unitary LED array-based optical link is capable of real-time transmission of digital audio signals (data rate = 6 Mbit/s) at a propagation distance of 100 cm in free space even though some of the constituent pixels are inactive for light detection.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Optical transmitters', 'Optical receivers', 'Quantum well devices', 'Optical device fabrication', 'Stimulated emission', 'Optical arrays']","['InGaN', 'LED array', 'photodiode', 'optical wireless communications']"

"With the fast development in the fields of photovoltaics and integrated circuits, the measurement of surface topographies and micro-scaled defects has attracted intensive interests. However, existing measurement methods are time-consuming and unsuitable for in-situ detection. Therefore, a fast topographic measurement method is developed based on the deflectometric microscope system. Microscopic deflectometry is an attractive tool due to its high sensibility to surface slopes and large dynamic range of measurement. For the quantitative reconstruction of surface topographies from slopes, an integration method is developed based on the minimum spanning tree, and the integration path is designed based on a sparse representation and a curl map. The robustness and accuracy of the integration method are validated by numerical simulation and experiments. This method can achieve a high measurement accuracy with a high lateral resolution and a depth of field of 90 μm, hereby improving the manufacturing efficiency and quality of opto-electronics functional devices.","['Microscopy', 'Surface topography', 'Surface reconstruction', 'Image reconstruction', 'Cameras', 'Optical imaging', 'Optical variables measurement']","['Defect', 'deflectometry', 'in-situ measurement', 'surface reconstruction']"
"Single-image dehazing techniques are extensively used in outdoor optical image acquisition equipment. Most existing methods pay attention to use various priors to estimate scene transmission. In this paper, a fast single-image dehazing algorithm is proposed based on a piecewise transformation model between the minimum channels of the hazy image and the haze-free image in optical model. The minimum channel of the haze-free image is obtained by the piecewise transformation, which is a quadratic function model that we establish for the dark region, and a linear transformation model is established for the bright region. Using the minimum channels of the hazy image and the haze-free image, a transmission estimation model is established based on the haze optical model with adjustment variables. To obtain an accurate estimation of atmospheric light, we estimate the atmospheric light twice. Finally, the haze-free image is restored. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has minimal halo artifacts and color distortion in various depths of field, flat areas and sky areas.

"A fully reconfigurable Fano resonator on a silicon photonic chip is reported. The Fano resonator is realized with the use of an add-drop micro-disk resonator (MDR) and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The waveguides at the through and drop ports of the MDR connect to two spiral waveguide arms of the MZI directly. Two independent metallic micro-heaters are incorporated on top of the MDR and the lower arm of the MZI. Thanks to the resonant mode interference between the MDR and the MZI, the Fano resonance occurs. By thermal tuning the resonance coupling between the MDR and the MZI, the generated Fano resonance is fully tunable. In addition to the independent tunable slope rate (SR) and the resonance wavelength, the Fano resonance wavelength can shift while its line shape remains by simultaneously controlling the two micro-heaters.

HD-DD-FTN algorithm can simultaneously compensate the serious high-frequency distortion and eliminate the enhanced in-band noise, which is more robust to the inter-symbol interference caused by the limited bandwidth.","['Optical distortion', 'OFDM', 'Optical noise', 'Distortion', 'Optical sensors', 'Bandwidth', 'Optical transmitters']","['ACO-SCFDM system', 'HD-DD-FTN algorithm', 'optical-wireless communications', 'free-space communications']"
"The scattering angle, the Haze ratio, and the field polarization factor of the frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser nonlinearly scattered from the semiconductor nanorod surface are investigated. Both the scattering angle and the reflected Haze ratio of the laser beam reflected from Si nanorod surface present a nonlinearly increasing trend with nanorod length. As the nanorod lengthens from 190 to 2760 nm, the scattering angle broadens from 2.5° to 25° and from 2.5° to 24°. Concurrently, the reflected Haze ratio increases from 5% to 22% and 3% to 21% under TE and TM-mode incidences, respectively. A significant polarization scrambling transfers the linearly polarization into an elliptical polarization, and the field polarization factor increases from 0.54 to 0.86 and from 0.42 to 0.84 under TE- and TM-mode incidences with an enlarging nanorod length from 190 to 2760 nm. The reflected Haze ratio is linearly proportional with the broadened scattering angle. However, the field polarization factor shows a gradually saturating effect at larger scattering angle. The theoretical calculation is used to quantitatively analyze the polarization scrambling effect, which demonstrates that the scattered wave nonlinearly depends on the surface corrugation and can be expressed by the second-order function of the surface corrugation strength. The strong correlations of the TE-mode scattering with the nanorod length and the TM-mode scattering with the laser incident angle are observed. The polarization of the reflected laser beam eventually transfers from a linear to an elliptical one with a nanorod length exceeding over 1 μm.","['Silicon', 'Laser beams', 'Scattering', 'Surface roughness', 'Rough surfaces', 'Optical surface waves', 'Surface emitting lasers']","['Scattering', 'nanostructures', 'optical and other properties']"

"Visible light communications achieve wireless communications using light sources such as lighting fixtures and electric signboards. The light sources need to blink at high speed to avoid flickering. However, the blinking frequency is much higher than the frame rate of the general-purpose cameras that are integrated into consumer devices such as smartphones. This paper proposes a method where the principle of the I/Q demodulator as employed in radio frequency communications is used to estimate the phase and amplitude of modulated light blinking at a sufficiently higher speed than the frame rate. This is achieved by using two cameras with slightly different exposure start timing and estimating the phase and amplitude from the pixel values of the light-emitting diode (LED) image in one frame for each camera. In contrast to the conventional method with a very short exposure time, the exposure time can be increased, resulting in higher efficiency of light capture.

"The measurement matrix in compressive imaging controls the crucial feature information for high performance recognition. In this study, a deterministic orthogonal measurement matrix design method using the discrete cosine transform and a compressive feature selection scheme are proposed to implement high-end computational optics for imaging. The selection scheme systematically evaluates the recognition importance for the frequency features, combined with a scaling of the contribution of the various coefficients used to produce a base matrix for the new group of measuring patterns, which ensures the minimal recognition difference for each individual order of frequency filters and combining a relatively complex expression to quickly find the best quantization values. The model parameters are gradually adjusted and eventually converge to the best result through training with a large number of pre-determined samples from the dataset and backpropagating the feature selection loss along with the recognition loss, and the data processing capabilities can be enhanced because the measurement matrix is a priori information for the recognition phase. The systematic ability of the proposed technique was verified through simulations and experiments on two standard datasets: MNIST and CIFAR-10.

"Multispectral image reconstruction, which aims to recover a three-dimensional (3D) spatial–spectral signal from a two-dimensional measurement in a spectral camera based on ghost imaging via sparsity constraint (GISC), has been attracting much attention recently. However, faced with abundant 3D spectral data, the reconstruction quality cannot meet the visual requirements. Based on the robust data processing capability of deep learning, a novel network called SSTU-Net3+ is constructed by improving U-Net3+ with a spatial–spectral transformer (SST). To enhance the feature representation of images during reconstruction, mixed pooling modules and new convolution processes are proposed to improve the performance of the encoder and decoder, with U-Net3+ as the backbone. To boost the quality of reconstructed images, with split and concatenate (Concat) operations, we construct SST modules by exploiting both spatial and spectral correlations of multispectral images to refine the spatial and spectral features. Furthermore, we employ the SST in the decoder to reconstruct the desired 3D cube. Given similar network parameters, experiments on GISC spectral imaging data show that, compared to convolutional neural network–based methods, the average peak signal-to-noise ratio of images reconstructed using SSTU-Net3+ is improved by 3%, the structural similarity is enhanced by 3%, and the spectral angle mapping is cut by 12%. Particularly, compared to differential ghost imaging and compressed sensing, the reconstruction quality of SSTU-Net3+ has been significantly improved. SSTU-Net3+ can process a large amount of 3D multispectral image data more efficiently and construct the target image more accurately than the abovementioned methods.","['Image reconstruction', 'Transformers', 'Imaging', 'Task analysis', 'Cameras', 'Correlation', 'Convolution']","['Multispectral image reconstruction', 'convolu- tional neural network', 'transformer', 'deep learning', 'ghost imaging']"

"The problem of long-distance imaging through time-varying scattering media, such as the atmosphere, is encountered in many science fields. Recent studies have demonstrated that random atmospheric variability can be considered a spatial light modulator in compressed sensing imaging. However, the quality of the reconstructed image needs to be further improved. In this paper, we propose a distributed cumulative synthesis method to improve the compressed sensing image reconstruction based on atmospheric modulation. For multiple original images of various types, the compressed sensing imaging simulation experiment with different sampling rates was conducted using the distributed cumulative synthesis method. The simulation results show that, compared with the imaging method using a single light source, the distributed cumulative synthesis method can effectively improve the quality of the reconstructed image, whether it is full sampling or undersampling. In addition, a sparsity impact factor is defined to quantify the reconstruction ability of the measurement matrix obtained by the distributed cumulative synthesis method. This value can be used as an evaluation index for the optimized design of the measurement matrix by the distributed cumulative synthesis method.

"Anisotropic plasmonic surface supports elliptic, hyperbolic and even flattened polaritons, which is quite interesting for the diffractionless and highly collimated propagation of infrared light at the nanoscale. However, direct real-space near-field observation of anisotropic plasmons as well as frequency dependent topological transitions in natural materials have not been realized. In this paper, we theoretically investigate real-space anisotropic plasmons in WTe 2 thin films by using a phenomenological cavity model, anisotropic near-field plasmonic images with specific interference patterns and isofrequency curves in momentum space have been demonstrated. Due to the frequency selective forbidden of plasmons along b axis, a topological transition from the elliptic to the hyperbolic regime is manifested. Moreover, the plasmons as well as topological transition present significant electrostatic-gating tunability. Our studies provide new insights into WTe 2 based plasmonic components for the manipulation of plasmon propagation, which capable of tailoring anisotropic two-dimensional light confinement in the far-infrared regime and can be applied to investigate other anisotropic materials.","['Plasmons', 'Dispersion', 'Polaritons', 'Optical imaging', 'Conductivity', 'Permittivity', 'Optical reflection']","['Plasmon', 'anisotropy', 'topological transition']"
"An independently tunable dual-resonance hybrid structure incorporating graphene is proposed to achieve selective light trapping and response tuning in the visible and near-infrared band. The incident light with different wavelengths are intensely localized in two separated resonant cavities via the synergetic effect of the guided mode resonances (GMRs) and optical Tamm states (OTSs), which leads to the strong enhancement of the light-matter interaction of graphene in different parts of the structure. The dual-band perfect absorption associated with critical coupling is achieved, whereas the two resonant modes can be independently tuned by adjusting the corresponding structural parameters. Furthermore, by dynamically changing the permittivity of the resonant cavities or the chemical potential of graphene, the absorption wavelength can be continuously adjusted and the absorption efficiency can be regulated stepwise.","['Absorption', 'Graphene', 'Dual band', 'Chemicals', 'Distributed Bragg reflectors', 'Permittivity']","['Graphene', 'dual-band', 'perfect absorption', 'active tunability', 'subwavelength structures', 'gratings']"

"Recently, visible light communication (VLC) has become a promising option for secure data transmission in industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs). In IIoT-VLC systems, small attocells are adopted to achieve higher spatial reuse rate, and the transmission of data, control and feedback bursts often requires high efficiency and real-time feature. Conventionally, multi-field (MF) frames are used in VLC systems which consists of sync header, channel training sequence, check field, etc. in addition to data payload. However, for short burst transmission, MF frames could result in efficiency loss and latency increase due to useless padding bits. In this paper, a novel coding scheme named integrated frame code (IFC) in physical layer to realize efficient and real-time transmission simultaneously is presented. IFC scheme reduces latency by simplifying transmission procedure and decreases overhead redundancy by integrated design. Specifically, we propose a joint soft-decision criterion for receiving without separate synchronization and channel estimation and then analyze its error performance. After that, we present IFC construction criterion and two design examples. At last, simulation results confirm that for short burst transmission, IFC achieves better efficiency and robustness than MF especially in moving process.","['Synchronization', 'Codes', 'Encoding', 'Training', 'Channel estimation', 'Visible light communication', 'Receivers']","['Attocell', 'frame coding', 'industrial internet of things', 'visible light communication']"

"Comparing with the application of charge coupled device (CCD) sensor, a kind of interference stripe noise (ISN) can be observed easily from the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensor-based digital holographic measurement (DHM) system because a series of optic coatings and filters are used in front of that sensor in order to improve its imaging effect. The improper assembly or the micro manufacturing error of these optic components may create the unexpected interference phenomena in the imaging sensor. To reduce that noise, an effective image processing method is developed. On one hand the Laplacian pyramid method is used to highlight the ISN and a cartoon-texture decomposition technique is carried out to remove the additive ISN. On the other hand, an improved Lee filtering is performed to restrain the multiplicative ISN. Extensive experiment results have shown that the image quality can be improved after the ISN reduction and this method is fit for solving a deionized water temperature estimation application where the texture complexity of target image is relatively low.","['Optical filters', 'Laplace equations', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical imaging', 'Adaptive optics', 'Holography', 'Holographic optical components']","['Digital holographic measurement', 'CMOS sensor', 'interference stripe noise', 'image denoising', 'temperature estimation']"

"A Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) temperature sensor was proposed by splicing a self-made hollow core anti-resonance fiber (HC-ARF) between two single mode fibers (SMFs). The HC-ARF was 2 mm long and one SMF was 20 mm in length. The SMF end face was coated with an Au film. When temperature varied from 45 °C to 85 °C, a sensitivity of 81.1 pm/°C was obtained at the waveband of 1550 nm∼1555 nm. When temperature varied from 35 °C to 95 °C, a sensitivity of 138.8 pm/°C was obtained at the waveband of 1571 nm∼1581 nm. Theoretical analysis suggested that the sensitivity of this proposed sensor can be easily adjusted by varying the length of the Au-coated SMF via the Vernier effect, which was confirmed by a subsequent experiment where the SMF length was varied from 20 mm to 170 mm. This work offers a simple sensitivity control method, and the proposed sensor is easy to manufacture, compact in structure, and convenient in performance control, which can be applied for a wide range of biological and chemical applications.","['Temperature sensors', 'Sensitivity', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Optical interferometry', 'Gold', 'Splicing', 'Reflection']","['Hollow Core anti-resonance fiber (HC-ARFs)', 'Fabry Perot Interferometer (FPI)', 'temperature sensor']"

"We consider error-rate prediction for dual-use lighting systems with visible light communication (VLC) functionality. Since light planning rather than communications engineering is usually the driving discipline for practical dual-use settings, we extract VLC channel parameters as a by-product from advanced 3-dimensional (3D) light-planning models. By this means, we attain realistic signal-to-noise ratios for exemplary positions of a VLC receiver, which allows us to predict corresponding end-to-end bit error rates (BERs). Specifically, our procedure accounts for important aspects of state-of-art lighting systems, such as realistic light distribution curves of employed luminaires, possible presence unmodulated light sources, and, particularly, adaptive dimming operations in response to prevalent sunlight. In this paper, we (i) devise a methodology for VLC systems with optical receive filtering to convert photometric quantities into radiometric quantities, (ii) present examples of BER predictions for selected modulation schemes within some basic office environments, and (iii) conduct an analysis of the resulting simulation accuracy for a particular 3D light-planning tool.

Performance of power splitting and WDM couplers can be made highly tolerant to typical process errors when an appropriate center-to-center spacing is chosen due to changes in the mode area compensating waveguide edge to edge variation along a very specific design locus. Using this approach, 2–3% index contrast waveguide couplers were fabricated and tested, demonstrating the predicted improved fabrication tolerances. High index contrast silicon-on-insulator systems are also shown to exhibit the same mechanism.

"The bitelecentric lens system is widely used in many domains, such as 3-D measurements and tube inspection. The magnification calibration for such a system is a crucial problem for its further application in achieving precise measurements. However, it is difficult to obtain an accurate result using a general magnification calibration method. In this paper, the Moiré-based interferometry is demonstrated to accurately calibrate the magnification of bitelecentric lens system that increases the speed and precision of the measurement. Two special grating marks containing upper and lower parts with slightly different periods are designed to generate Moiré fringes. By analyzing the finally obtained Moiré fringes, the magnification could be determined through Fourier-based phase analysis and a phase unwrapping algorithm, and the further the deviation is from the theoretical value, the more obvious the differences between upper and lower periods will be. Both simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results indicate that the magnification could be calibrated at the accuracy of 0.4% with extraordinary sensitivity.","['Gratings', 'Calibration', 'Optical interferometry', 'Lenses', 'Imaging', 'Diffraction gratings']","['Moiré fringes', 'magnification', 'grating marks', 'phase analysis']"
"Gradient-descent-based digitized adjoint method offers a way to realize the high-efficiency inverse design of digital nanophotonic devices with diverse functions. However, the vanishing gradient problem encountered in the design of high-dimension devices may lead to significant inefficiencies, making it difficult to integrate novel functions on a single chip. Here, we propose a highly efficient digitized adjoint method for large-scale inverse design, called adaptive gradient-descent with momentum. It uses the first- and second-order momentum, instead of the gradient, to update the device pattern during adjoint optimization. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, we design a coarse wavelength division multiplexer and a three-mode power divider with design dimensions of 800 and 1360, respectively, which are approximately 2-4 times that of conventional digital nanophotonic devices. The simulation results show that, compared with the conventional gradient descent method, the momentum-assisted adjoint method has about 4-6 times higher efficiency and obtains better optimization performance, which provides a powerful tool for the inverse design of novel digital nanophotonic devices.","['Optimization', 'Performance evaluation', 'Permittivity', 'Nanoscale devices', 'Linear programming', 'Wavelength division multiplexing', 'Crosstalk']","['Inverse design', 'silicon photonics', 'adjoint method']"

"In this paper, we present a neural network-based framework to compensate for the nonlinear distortion of high-speed continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems. In practice, the nonlinear impairment of imperfect devices could bring interference to the measured quadrature values and thus compromise the parameter estimation procedure and the secure key rate. Specifically, for a high-speed CV-QKD system, the balanced homodyne detector (BHD) and the following analog-to-digital converter are the primary sources of nonlinear impairment. The nonlinear distortion effect will be more pronounced as the pulse repetition rate increases. We propose an autoencoder-based network to learn the inner patterns of distorted data and then compensate the quadrature measurements in real-time at the receiver’s side. The numerical simulation demonstrates that the excess noise induced by nonlinear impairment is reduced to the 10^{-3} level in the shot noise unit.

Simulation and experimental results show that the mean squared error is below 10^{-4} with only 3000 samples needed for polarization-division-multiplexed (PDM) quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) or quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) systems with a roll-off factor below 0.1 for an optical signal-to-noise ratio greater than 12 dB. Compared with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, our proposed method has a more robust performance under low roll-off factor signals and in low-sampling-rate scenarios. The mean squared error remains the same for a nominal symbol rate (i.e., the ratio of the symbol rate to the sampling rate, also widely known as oversampling rate) ranging from 0.1 to 0.9.","['Correlation', 'Maximum likelihood estimation', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Wavelength division multiplexing', 'Optical noise', 'Licenses', 'Gaussian noise']","['Frequency estimation', 'nonlinear least squares estimation', 'non-data-aided']"
"Recently, an exceptional point (EP) was constructed in a coupled double-ring resonator. Generally, such non-Hermitian optical systems are realized via material selection and a spatially precise layout. However, because of material limitations, some system parameters cannot be changed after the waveguide is fabricated. In this study, We demonstrate a lithium niobate-based tunable system for controlling system dispersion and loss, the resonator structure made of lithium niobate is theoretically and numerically investigated and analyzed. Lithium niobate is chosen because it exhibits good electro-optic properties. Furthermore, the real part of the potential energy term of the non-Hermitian system is regulated using external electric field. Consequently, a frequency shift of up to 149 GHz is observed in the double characteristic peak of the transmission spectrum with a contrast of up to 0.43. In addition, a gain-influenced EP is observed in a coupled dual-ring resonator system by introducing gain material. It has potential application in future optical fiber communication, optical quantum computing, and environmental sensing.","['Electric fields', 'Optical resonators', 'Lithium niobate', 'Optical variables control', 'Optical refraction', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical fiber sensors']","['Coupled resonators', 'electro-optical effects', 'inte- grated optics', 'optical waveguides']"
"Non-uniformity is a common phenomenon in infrared imaging system, which seriously affects imaging quality. In view of the problems of existing non-uniformity correction of infrared images, such as loss of image details and blurred edge of image, an improved non-uniformity correction method of infrared images based on convolution neural network using long-short connections (LSC-CNN) is proposed. The proposed method designs a long-short connection residual network structure suitable for non-uniformity correction of infrared image.The network depth is increased to fully learn the noise by short connections, image sizes are adjusted to reduce the number of parameters, the long connection is used to solve the problem of image information loss caused by transposed convolution, and a multiply operation is carried out to enhance the contrast of corrected images. Besides, batch normalization is utilized to improve the training speed. The experimental results show that LSC-CNN has excellent performance in non-uniformity correction of infrared images whether qualitative evaluation or quantitative evaluation. LSC-CNN is especially effective in image detail preservation and image edge protection whose average PSNR exceeds 37.5 dB and the average SSIM is greater than 0.98.","['Convolution', 'Neural networks', 'Mathematical model', 'Kernel', 'Feature extraction', 'Noise measurement', 'Image edge detection']","['Infrared image', 'non-uniformity correction', 'combination of long and short connections', 'improved neural network']"

"In this study, four cylindrical cavities with diameters of more than 10 mm are utilized to confine aluminum plasmas to improve the signal intensities of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Primary and secondary enhancements of spectra are observed.

The delay time for both primary and secondary signal enhancements is postponed with decreasing the laser energy or increasing the cavity diameter. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) of spectra signal in different experimental conditions are discussed to illustrate the uncertainties of measurement.

"The recent interest in using visible light as a means of communication has opened up possibilities for using visible light for other applications as well, such as indoor positioning. Visible light offers higher bandwidth, immunity from electromagnetic radiation, and most importantly it can be seamlessly integrated into the existing lighting infrastructure. This paper proposes a visible light based positioning model for estimating an object’s three-dimensional (3-D) parameters such as height and radius in addition to location in an indoor environment. The model is built using neural networks (NN), trained by simulating numerous multiple object scenarios in an indoor environment. It also takes into account the shadowing effects so it can be implemented in a multiple obstacle environment. The proposed algorithm has numerous applications, such as positioning assisted communication, suspicious object monitoring and surveillance in an indoor environment. The proposed model achieves a location accuracy of 5.4 cm, which could be further improved to 4 cm at the expense of extra hardware. The accuracy in measuring the height and radius of the objects using the proposed framework is observed to be 4.39 cm and 1.27 cm, respectively. In addition, we also propose a methodology to optimize the power distribution to the light-emitting-diodes (LED’s) in order to get the optimum location accuracy while maintaining the total power constraint on the system.

"There has been increasing interest in deploying non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging systems for recovering objects hidden behind corners. Existing solutions need to calibrate the imaging system using auxiliary apparatus and additional detectors. We present an online calibration technique that directly decouples the transients, which are acquired by onsite scanning on a relay surface, into line-of-sight (LOS) and hidden components. We use the former to directly (re-)calibrate the system upon changes of scene - surface configurations, scannable regions, and sampling patterns, and the latter for hidden object recovery via spatial-, frequency-, or learning-based techniques. We also calculate a Gamma map from the LOS component to preview calibration effects for accurate transient measurements. The entire process of our calibration for 64 scanning points takes no more than 14 seconds on an Intel i7-6600H CPU. In particular, our technique avoids using auxiliary calibration tools such as mirrors or checkerboards and supports both uniform and non-uniform sampling in an onsite NLOS imaging system.

An electrical bandpass filter is used to filter out the spectrum after photodetection in order to realize the seamless antenna transmission.

The DML based approach reveals mildly better performance in comparison to the MZMs in terms of higher achieved signal-to-noise ratio and lower error vector magnitude (EVM).

"In-band full-duplex (IBFD) technology has become important for future wireless communications, due to its ability of increasing the radio-frequency (RF) spectrum efficiency. However, the benefits can only be realized if the self-interference (SI) is sufficiently suppressed. RF cancellation is important for IBFD systems due to its ability of SI mitigation. But it becomes more difficult for RF cancellation while the frequency and bandwidth increase. In real scenarios, the response of the multi-path SI channel is not frequency-flat, which also limits the cancellation performance. To solve these problems, we present a photonic-enabled multi-tap RF canceller in this paper. The proposed RF canceller has the ability of cancelling multi-path SI.

"The widespread deployment of white light-emitting6 diodes (LEDs) for illumination provides a unique opportunity to create a flexible, accurate, and ubiquitous indoor communication and positioning system. In this paper, we exploit the location information obtained via LEDs to improve the communication performance of an indoor visible light communication (VLC) system. Specifically, we propose an optimal LED power management framework to maximize the average data rate across the room while satisfying the bit error rate (BER) and illumination constraint across the room. The maximum allowed localization error, as a function of the number of blockages and the LED irradiance angle, have been calculated. In addition, the closed-form expression for the BER is derived for the proposed optimal LED power allocation scheme. We have also formulated an optimization problem that will maximize the power savings among the LEDs with respect to the number of blockages and permissible error in localization. It has been shown that, by employing the proposed optimal LED power allocation will results in a significant amount of power-saving, which is approximately 40% for 4 LEDs configuration and 70% 26 for 8 LEDs configuration as compared to equal power allocation. Further, the maximum allowed localization error is found out to be 28 approximately 7 cm and 18 cm with 4 and 8 LEDs, respectively, to 29 achieve the maximum achievable data rate. Finally, it is shown that 30 the dimming range of up to 70% can be achieved for the proposed system.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Visible light communication', 'Resource management', 'Lighting', 'Location awareness', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Optimization']","['Visible light communication (VLC)', 'LED power management', 'power saving', 'localization', 'human blockage', 'matern hardcore point process (MHCP)']"

"Kerr optical frequency combs have found various applications in science and technology, and minimizing their pump power has become an important area of research. These combs are generated using a wide variety of platforms, with a size ranging from micrometers to millimeters, and quality factors ranging from millions to billions.

We propose a suitably normalized threshold pump power as a metric to optimize Kerr comb generation independently of the platform.

The current source can be either electric or magnetic. It can be oriented either parallel to the layers or perpendicular to them.

The proposed technique utilizes inward and outward recurrence processes in order to solve for the desired quadruple-dyadic Green's functions. It requires the calculation of 6 spectral coefficients only, from which all types of spectral Green's functions can be calculated. The proposed formulation is written such that the electromagnetic fields are directly obtained in terms of the current sources rather than the vector and scalar potentials with no explicit analogy with transmission lines. The dependencies on the z -coordinates of the source and field points are expressed explicitly, which is important for Volume Integral Equation (VIE) formulation.

"We demonstrate a microfiber Bragg grating as the reflective refractometer with the function of self-photoheating. The rare earth-doped fiber provides not only the photosensitivity to the UV modulation but also the effective pump laser absorption and photoheating conversion. The rare earth-doped microfiber Bragg grating, which is cladding-removed by the hydrofluoric acid, can detect the tiny refractive index change with a resolution of 10 -4 RIU scale. The self-photoheating could be realized by 980 nm pump absorption and non-radiative transition process of the ytterbium and erbium ions, which are well-preserved by the core structure after etching. Monitored by the reflective grating signal, the photoheating can manipulate 30 °C increase of the device in the air, 8 °C in the ethanol, and 4 °C in the water. The second time-scale heating/cooling response allows the sensor to act as ad optical switch for engineering temperature.

"For the fronthaul link in the fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, optical fiber is one of the most widely used medium, owing to its large bandwidth and low transmission loss. However, in some scenarios, especially the dense urban areas, the installation of fiber optic cables is costly and difficult to establish. Alternatively, the free space optical (FSO) link can be installed easily and spans complex terrain. In this context, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid FSO/Wireless transmission system based on bandpass delta-sigma modulator and real-time coherent transponder. Advantage of the proposed technique is twofold. Firstly, coherent detection is applied to improve the system sensitivity compared to conventional direct detection. Secondly, delta-sigma modulation (DSM) is utilized to greatly simplify the wireless transmitters and to enhance the bandwidth flexibility. Over a 50-m FSO and 1-m wireless link, a 64-QAM wireless signal at 1 GHz with 500 MHz bandwidth is successfully transmitted. With 16 wavelength division multiplexing channels, the total throughput of the system is up to 24 Gb/s. Meanwhile, the error vector magnitude (EVM) of all channels is around 2.68% and 6.51%, which are demonstrated after FSO and FSO/Wireless transmission, respectively. The results meet the requirement of the third-generation partnership project release 15 with EVM value of 8% for 64-QAM. Moreover, sensitivity of the real-time coherent receiver is lower than −48 dBm under the 7% forward error correction limit with bit error rate of 3.8e-3.","['Wireless communication', 'Wireless sensor networks', 'Optical fiber cables', 'Optical fibers', 'Sensitivity', 'Real-time systems', 'Costs']","['Free space optical communication', '5G wireless transmission', 'real-time coherent receiver', 'delta-sigma modulation']"

"In this article, we propose, design, and numerically assess a novel parametric refractive index profile for optical fiber, which we refer to as reciprocal-inverse graded index fiber (R-IGIF). The R-IGIF features a shape parameter \alpha that controls the refractive index behavior (i.e. concave vs convex). We performed a systematic scanning of parameter' effects; using finite element method in Comsol Multiphysics, in order to design R-IGIFs that handle robust orbital angular momentum (OAM) channels (i.e. low radial modes). The designed fibers possess high inter-channels separation ( \Delta n_{eff} \geq 1\times 10 −4 ) that outperforms standard step index fiber and inverse parabolic graded index fiber; hence, reduces channels crosstalk. Numerical simulations show that the supported OAM modes are of high purity ( \geq\! 99.9\% ), enabling low-level intrinsic crosstalk ( \leq\! -30\,dB ). Further investigations considered metrics over the C and L ITU-T bands including the cut-offs wavelengths, chromatic dispersion, differential group delay, effective area, and nonlinearity coefficient. Results show potential capability to achieve stable data channels transmission. Further assessments have been carried out under practical condition (i.e. bending) by evaluating the \Delta n_{eff} , the intra-mode walk-offs, and the confinement loss. The findings show great resilience to bending effects. Therefore, based on these deep physical investigations of modes carrying data, the R-IGIF could find application in next generation space division multiplexing SDM-Networks.","['Optical fibers', 'Optical fiber dispersion', 'Indexes', 'Refractive index', 'Optical fiber networks', 'Measurement', 'Crosstalk']","['Space division multiplexing', 'mode division multiplexing', 'specialty fibers', 'vortex modes', 'orbital angular momentum', 'transmission performances metrics']"

The resonance is identified to have a Bloch wave nature, existing only for its even-order modes, restricted by the coupling phase matching conditions in a reflection configuration mode. It is also shown that the resonance properties are largely subjected to the size of the grating grooves, where localized cavity mode can be excited for large-size grooves, leading to broad absorption peaks due to nonresonant losses and bringing in new absorption peaks resulting from cavity resonances in the grooves.","['Gratings', 'Metals', 'Absorption', 'Reflection', 'Dielectrics', 'Optical surface waves', 'Surface waves']","['Subwavelength structures', 'gratings', 'resonance', 'absorption', 'polarization']"

"The diffraction characteristics of several types of phase gratings often etched on the substrate by the micro/nanofabrication techniques are analytically explored using scalar-based analysis in this paper. The process of an incident wave being reflected or transmitted by the diffraction grating is regarded as a process of modulation, and the reflectance or transmittance can be unified as the modulation index. The mechanisms of phase modulation, amplitude modulation, and the amplitude–phase hybrid modulation in different situations are discussed. Analytical results indicate that the diffraction efficiency is directly determined by the phase difference of adjacent features, i.e., the cyclically distributed ridges and grooves that induce different phase and amplitude variations. The absolute phase grating with phase difference equivalent to \pi has the maximum diffraction efficiency among all types of gratings.

A rotating ground glass diffuser is adopted, in preference to a commonly used digital micro-mirror device (DMD), to encode a two-dimensional (2D) image into single-pixel signals. We retrieve images with an 8.8% sampling ratio after the calibration of the pseudo-random pattern of the diffuser under light-emitting diode (LED) illumination. Furthermore, we demonstrate hyperspectral imaging with line array detection by adding a diffraction grating. As the random and fixed patterns of a rotating diffuser placed in the image plane can serve as 2D modulation patterns in single-pixel imaging, we do not need further calibration for spectral imaging case since we use a parallel recovery strategy for images at all wavelengths. The implementation results in a cost-effective single-pixel camera for high-dimensional imaging, with potential for imaging in non-visible wavebands.","['Imaging', 'Cameras', 'Detectors', 'Calibration', 'Hyperspectral imaging', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Correlation']","['Single-pixel imaging', 'spectral imaging', 'scattering medium']"

"In this paper, a symmetric training sequence-based (STSB) carrier frequency offset estimation (FOE) scheme for coherent free-space optical (CFSO) communication is proposed. In the proposed technique, we exploit the training-sequence-based (TSB) carrier FOE algorithm to the CFSO communication system in the quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation format. A symmetric training sequence, tailored to the carrier FOE algorithm for atmospheric turbulence channel, is formulated to accurately identify the correct temporal position of a data frame from received signals.

In this way, the proposed technique significantly improves the estimation accuracy. Furthermore, by avoiding the time-consuming 4th power operation, the proposed method reduces the computational complexity while expanding the FOE range. Therefore, when compared with existing algorithms, our proposed technique can achieve more accurate timing, a wider estimation range, and lower complexity.

Based on the theoretical analyses and experimental results, it shows that the generated laser-beam-based signal keeps being coherent until reaching the observed object.

"In high-speed optical fiber communications, chromatic dispersion (CD) estimation is essential for the monitoring and compensation of CD-induced impairments. Compared with coherent detection, in short-reach optical communication systems, intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) is more widely used, and the existing dispersion estimation techniques usually require training signals or a large amount of data for curve fitting or machine learning. However, these methods cannot provide in-service estimation. This paper presents a novel technique for in-service CD estimation in IM/DD short-reach optical communication systems based on our derived analytical model. With the analytical model, the in-service CD estimation is realized via the direct power spectrum analysis of the received signal. Unlike previous studies that only work with single-frequency sinusoidal signals, the practical random data with the rectangular type of base waveform is considered in our model. Therefore, our method can be applied to the dispersion estimation of various pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) based systems.

"Van der Waals heterostructures of black phosphorous(BP) and Molybdenum Disulfide(MoS 2 ) is designed and evaluated for photodetection application from visible to mid-infrared wavelength up to 4.5 μm. The device possesses a low dark current less than 0.1 μA for short wavelength light. For visible and near infrared radiation, the contribution of heat and photo energy to current enhancement is analyzed. Dark current drift by joule heat and laser heat absorbed is observed in short waveband. The difference in response speed is believed to be a result of the competition of BP and MoS 2 photocurrent. Gate tunable response time and on-off ratio makes the device versatile in potential application. For mid infrared radiation, BP-MoS 2 heterojunction with a dedicated thickness tailoring of MoS 2 exhibits similar negative response as an intrinsic BP. The normalized detectivity is {D}^* of 2.02 \times {10}^8\ Jones for the 4.5 μm mid-infrared radiation. Elaborate reduction of the noise is conducted to get the time resolvable photo-response.

"The charge-coupled device-based Shaker–Hartmann wavefront sensor has been widely used to compensate for wavefront distortion in coherent optical communication. However, the influence of strong background light causes large errors when restoring the signal light wavefront. This study proposes a wavefront recovery method by combining a detector array with an optical nutation of the local oscillator. By adding a small rotation angle to the local oscillator, the wavefront slope is estimated according to the output of the change law of the mixed signal and the local oscillator light, and the multi-order Zernike mode is used to reconstruct the signal light wavefront. Simulation studies show that the root-mean-square value (RMS) and the coherence efficiency of the signal light wavefront were significantly optimized. Under direct sunlight, the estimation compensation error of the wavefront slope reached 0.008. Under strong turbulence, the mixing efficiency was increased by nearly 97.5 times, and the RMS was reduced to the original value of 0.048 The designed system has good background light compensation and wavefront recovery capabilities and is suitable for coherent optical communication under direct sunlight.","['Optical fiber communication', 'Local oscillators', 'Atmospheric waves', 'Optical filters', 'Optical distortion', 'Detectors', 'Estimation']","['Optical communication', 'Atmospheric turbulence', 'Shaker–Hartmann wavefront sensor']"
"Modal phase matching (MPM) is a widely used phase matching technique in Al x Ga 1-x As and other χ (2) nonlinear waveguides for efficient wavelength conversions. The use of a non-fundamental spatial mode compensates the material dispersion but also reduces the spatial overlap of the three interacting waves and therefore limits the conversion efficiency. In this work, we develop a technique to increase the nonlinear overlap by modifying the material nonlinearity, instead of the traditional method of optimizing the modal field profiles. This could eliminate the limiting factor of low spatial overlap inherent to MPM and significantly enhance the conversion efficiency. Among the design examples provided, this technique could increase the conversion efficiency by a factor of up to ~ 290 in an Al x Ga 1-x As waveguide. We further show that this technique is applicable to all χ (2) material systems that utilize MPM for wavelength conversion.","['Optical wavelength conversion', 'Optical waveguides', 'Optical frequency conversion', 'Photonics', 'Licenses', 'Indexes', 'Graphical models']","['Wavelength conversion', 'second harmonic generation', 'difference frequency generation', 'modal phase matching', 'compound semiconductor', 'Aluminum Gallium Arsenide']"

"A record net gain of 17-dB has been demonstrated in a 300-nm broadband single-mode Cr-doped crystalline core fiber (CCF) with a 19-μm core diameter and 18-cm fiber length. The gain-per-unit-length of the CCF, which is an impressive 94 dB/m, is significantly higher than that currently achieved in other rare-earth doped fiber amplifiers, such as Er and Bi-doped fibers. This high gain was achieved by matching the transmission mode between CCF and single mode fiber for improving the coupling efficiency. We controlled precisely the conical molten-zone in the growth process, as well as the optimization of the Cr 4+ concentration through thermal annealing and polarization pumping techniques. We also measured the noise figures of several core diameters, finding that the 19-μm core diameter CCF exhibited a noise figure 4.2 dB lower than the previous 25-μm core diameter CCF. This result is important because it indicates that the smaller diameter CCF is capable of providing even better signal-to-noise ratios. And the error-floor free data transmission of the CCF was successfully demonstrated at a rate of 10 Gb/s. This is an important achievement because it shows that the CCF has the potential to be used in high-speed communication applications.","['Optical fiber amplifiers', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Optical fiber polarization', 'Annealing', 'Couplings', 'Gain', 'Fiber lasers']","['Fiber amplifier', 'annealing and polarization pump', 'net gain', 'and pump-to-signal-conversion-efficiency']"

"We have proposed and experimentally demonstrated a high-speed and point-to-multipoint (P2MP) mobile fronthaul (MFH) downstream system based on the code-division multiplexing (CDM) and self-homodyne coherent (SHC) technologies. We find that compared with the traditional 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) signal transmission, the change of phase noise between two demultiplexed symbols is much larger in the CDM-16QAM signal transmission because it is the accumulation of phase noise change of n multiplexed symbols. Therefore, a low-complexity pilot sequence-assisted phase noise estimation algorithm is proposed and designed to compensate for the phase noise caused by fiber mismatch length, which makes it possible to use a low-cost distributed feedback (DFB) laser. Besides, the spread signal's distribution in the frequency domain of each code sequence is different, leading to different transmission performances between different remote radio units (RRUs). A power optimization scheme is proposed to balance the transmission performances of different RRUs by multiplying each channel's signal by a normalized weight factor at the transmitter. The experimental results show that the proposed system could successfully support the transmission of 245 Gb/s 16QAM signal from baseband unit (BBU) to 7 RRUs (each RRU could have 2 antennas to transmit signals at 2 polarizations) over 10 km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF).

"To suppress the fluctuation of light intensity during wavelength tuning caused by carrier induced optical loss, we utilized a single quantum well (SQW) inserted into the bulk core layer of distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs), called an active DBR structure, for a 2-μm-wavelength superstructure grating (SSG-) DBR laser. In the active DBR structure, some injected currents in the DBR regions are consumed for an optical gain in the inserted SQW, which suppresses the optical loss in the bulk core layer induced by the free-carrier absorption. The SSG-DBR laser fabricated with the active DBR structure exhibited a more than 8-nm lasing wavelength shift of a single SSG-DBR reflection peak. In addition, the reduction of light intensity was less than 2.7 dB when the total injection current of the front and rear DBR regions was 200 mA. This is significantly smaller than that of a conventional SSG-DBR laser that has the same device structure except for the SQW in the DBR regions, although a relatively large current was required for the wavelength shift. Evaluations of the lasing characteristics under various combinations of the front and rear DBR currents demonstrated that all seven SSG-modes could be selectively oscillated for wavelength tuning. In addition, the measured fluctuation of light intensities was less than 5 dB for almost all conditions even when the front and rear DBR currents were individually changed from 0 up to 100 mA. Furthermore, the active-DBR type laser simultaneously attained the quasi-continuous tuning range of 51.2 nm and the fluctuation of light intensity across the whole range of less than 2.5 dB which represents a significant suppression compared to the conventional SSG-DBR laser with the same laser cavity design.","['Distributed Bragg reflectors', 'Laser tuning', 'Semiconductor lasers', 'Indium gallium arsenide', 'Reflection', 'Semiconductor optical amplifiers', 'Measurement by laser beam']","['Distributed Bragg reflector laser', 'semiconductor laser', 'tunable lasers']"

"Numerous studies have shown that the use of PAM-4 modulation format for DFB lasers with integrated passive regions (DFB IPE lasers) can greatly improve information transmission capabilities. In this paper, it is found by theoretical analysis that a passive waveguide can reduce the photon concentration and injection current in the cavity under the same output optical power. The DFB IPE laser has large saturated optical power and slope efficiency, which reduces the distortion of the electro-optical conversion of the PAM-4 signal.

"We propose and experimentally demonstrate a high-performance micro-ring resonator (MRR) with a large free-spectral range (FSR) on the lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) platform. Mode crosstalk happens in LNOI waveguide bends because more than one mode is generated from the anisotropy of lithium niobate, which limits the minimum bending radius of MRRs. Mode properties of ridge waveguides on X-cut LNOI with different bend radii and wavelengths have been analyzed to remove the effect of mode hybridization and reduce the mode crosstalk. On this basis, a small radius MRR with large FSR and 3dB bandwidth is achieved. Further, to deal with the wavelength shift caused by fabrication error, a second-order micro-ring resonators (2 nd -order MRRs) filter with a box-like response and a high out-of-band rejection ratio is realized. Besides, a multichannel demultiplexing filter is realized based on 2 nd -order MRRs with low crosstalk (<−13 dB) at a channel spacing of 1.16 nm. The demonstration of the demultiplexing filter with a box-like response paves an important step for high-density photonic integration on the LNOI platform.","['Optical waveguides', 'Resonator filters', 'Optical filters', 'Crosstalk', 'Photonics', 'Bandwidth', 'Periodic structures']","['LNOI', 'box-like spectrum', 'WDM', 'MRR']"
"In this paper, a self-designed solar cell-based optical detector is proposed and demonstrated in a long-distance underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) link. Benefitting from a large detection area, the detector could successfully capture optical signals with a received power density of 5.62 \bf{\mu W/c}\mathbf{m}^\mathbf{2} . To resist the baseline drift caused by the low-frequency cut-off of the system, an envelope detector-based baseline compensator is proposed. Comparing with digital solutions, the proposed compensator could be established in analog domain with common electronic components. With the compensator, a frequency domain equalizer (FDE) and a maximum ratio combing (MRC) algorithm, an 18 Mbps non-return-to-zero (NRZ) on-off keying (OOK) modulated link over an 80 m underwater channel is finally achieved. The proposed baseline compensator could compensate the low-frequency components effectively with low cost. Moreover, under a strong ambient light of approximately 1200 lux, the performance of the link shows little degradation. Our work shows a potential solution of long-distance UWOC system with ambient light tolerance, which is compatible with practical environment.","['Detectors', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Arrays', 'Optical detectors', 'High-speed optical techniques', 'Optical arrays', 'Resistance']","['Baseline drift', 'photoconductive', 'series-connection', 'solar array', 'underwater wireless optical communication']"

"In this paper, a novel kind of GaN light-emitting diode (LED) with P and N discontinuous ohmic contact electrodes and discontinuous current blocking layer (CBL) is designed and prepared. Multiple contact windows under the N- and P-electrodes formed by etching help realize the discontinuous ohmic contacts with the N-GaN layer and the ITO layer, respectively. Similarly, by etching a plurality of discontinuous openings with the same pitch in the CBL, a discontinuous CBL structure is formed. As compared with traditional structures, the discontinuous ohmic contacts can maximize the number of current paths which allow the carriers to be collected from all four directions, leading to a more uniform current spreading and thermal management. Furthermore, as the contacts are not continuous any longer, some of the otherwise removed materials (such as the active region) lying between the patches are saved. The optoelectronic characteristics, junction temperature, thermal resistance, and infrared thermography measurements are conducted and the current distribution is simulated. The results show that the novel LED structure has better optoelectronic performances and current spreading ability compared to traditional devices. At 150 mA current, the luminous efficiency is 15.2% higher than the traditional LED, the junction temperature is reduced by 4.9%, and the thermal resistance is reduced by 12%.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Temperature measurement', 'Electrodes', 'Temperature distribution', 'Ohmic contacts', 'Licenses', 'Thermal resistance']","['GaN LEDs', 'discontinuous ohmic contact electrodes', 'current spreading', 'thermal management']"

In the proposed scheme, by adjusting the phase difference between the radio frequency (RF) signals loaded on the two arms of the DD-MZM, and filtering the center carrier by fiber Bragg grating (FBG), thus the upper and lower output spectra can be realized randomly hop between the positive and negative first-order sidebands and serve as carriers for data modulation. And the data of different users are divided into many data slices in the time domain and then modulated to these carriers. To verify the feasibility of the proposed OFH scheme, we demonstrate an error-free transmission through 40 km fiber with 10 Gbps hopping rate and 10 Gbps data rate by simulation tools. In addition, we also establish a theoretical model to evaluate the security performance quantitatively, and the results show that the computing power required by illegal third parties to crack through brute force reaches 1.07 × 10 27 calculations per second under certain conditions, which is almost impossible.

"Due to the high path loss of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ultraviolet communications (UVC) channel, pulse modulation schemes, such as on-off keying (OOK) and M-ary pulse-position modulation (PPM), and photon-counting receivers are commonly adopted. Although M-ary PPM can be demodulated and decoded without the channel state information, its spectral efficiency is lower than OOK's. To improve the spectral efficiency of M-ary PPM in NLOS UVC, a power-domain multilayer-superposed transmission (MST) scheme with binary PPM (BPPM) is proposed in this work. Based on this scheme, the signal in each layer can be directly decoded without successive interference cancellation, which is necessary for other MST schemes in the power domain. Hence, a low complexity receiver in the NLOS UVC system can be realized. Additionally, the bit-error rate (BER) and achievable data rate (ADR) expressions of the proposed MST scheme are derived. Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to verify the analytical BER expression. The NLOS UVC system performance employing the proposed MST scheme is further demonstrated and compared with pure BPPM. The results indicate that with the optimal power allocation factor for each layer, the overall ADR of the NLOS UVC system with the proposed power-domain MST scheme can surpass that with pure BPPM.","['Nonlinear optics', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Scattering', 'Symbols', 'Optical scattering', 'Optical receivers', 'Optical transmitters']","['Ultraviolet communications', 'non-line-of-sight', 'multilayer-superposed transmission scheme', 'binary pulse-position modulation']"

"A new variational method for the modal analysis of 2-D waveguide structures is proposed in this paper. Maxwell's equations describing the modal properties of scalar and semivectorial guided waves in the 2-D waveguides are expressed as variational/minimization problems, which are then discretized in terms of a finite-difference scheme on a finite rectangular computational window. By applying a dynamic programming technique to solve such variational problems, a 1-D equation representing the relation between the modal fields on any pair of adjacent columns in the computational window can be derived. By using such 1-D equation in a stepwise fashion from one boundary column toward the other boundary column, a system of linear equations with the unknown column modal fields can be derived and then solved to give both the accurate modal indexes and the discrete modal fields. In the examples of one weakly guiding rib-type dielectric waveguide and another strongly guiding silicon-on-insulator waveguide, computational results show that a small size of the coefficient matrix for such a system of linear equations is adequate to cause a relative error of 10 -5 -10 -6 in the evaluation of the modal indexes reachable in an efficient manner. The results of the convergence tests show that the proposed method is at least an order of magnitude faster than the conventional finite-difference beam propagation method because of the transformation of a 2-D problem into a 1-D problem. Moreover, the proposed method is applied to investigate the modal properties of the conductor-gap-silicon plasmonic waveguide.

"Underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) systems have been widely studied to achieve high-speed wireless communications. To investigate and design UOWC systems, a mathematical model to characterize the accurate performance of UOWC systems is important. However, the previous mathematical models of UOWC systems have limitations, which mainly focused on the line-of-sight (LOS) link, and only considered the vertical incident background light or optical filters with constant transmittance for simplicity. To overcome these limitations, we establish an accurate UOWC system model, incorporating the previously overlooked impact of signal and sun lights incident angles and including both LOS and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels. Our proposed accurate UOWC system model is validated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Results show that our proposed model can capture the changes of received powers of both signal and background lights with various transmitter and receiver alignments and orientations in both LOS and NLOS channels, which typically affect the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) and bit-error-rate (BER) performance of UOWC systems. Furthermore, we show that the incident angles of both signal and sun lights have significant impact on the system performance, and our proposed model can be used to optimize the PD rotation angle to improve the SNR performance.

Compared to the QW laser grown on a conventional (001) substrate, a higher differential gain, and smaller LEF are observed for the laser grown on the (110) substrate with the (110) plane as the mirror facet. This is primarily due to the reduced effective mass of the valence band. The dynamic characteristics of (001)-and (110)-oriented DFB laser is theoretically studied using the one-dimensional traveling wave model (1D TWM) at 25°C and 95°C. The simulation results show that the lower chirp and wider modulation bandwidth can be achieved for the QW laser grown on (110) substrate.","['Crystals', 'Substrates', 'High-speed optical techniques', 'Laser theory', 'Bandwidth', 'Optical feedback', 'Laser modes']","['Crystal orientation', 'differential gain', 'linewidth enhancement factor', '–3dB bandwidth']"

"Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a computational imaging technique that combines a large field of view and high-resolution. It stitches low-resolution images captured under varying illumination corresponding to different angles in the frequency domain to realize quantitative phase imaging with high spatial bandwidth product. Our previous algorithm (AA algorithm) effectively solves the problem of noise interference and the algorithm is difficult to converge. In FPM experiments, the fluctuation of LED intensity is inevitable, which significantly affects the quality of reconstructed images. The usual solution is to perform intensity correction in the reconstruction algorithm. However, in this study, it is found that the AA algorithm is incompatible with the intensity correction method, which will decrease the convergence performance. To solve this problem, we develop a more general reconstruction algorithm based on the AA algorithm in this study. The simulation and experimental results show that the improved algorithm framework is compatible with the intensity correction method, resulting in an increase in intensity correction reliability and effectiveness. Compared with the GS and AS methods with intensity correction, the error in reconstruction results can be reduced by 52.03% and 29.35%, respectively, without increasing the amount of calculation.","['Image reconstruction', 'Fluctuations', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Imaging', 'Reconstruction algorithms', 'Microscopy', 'Lighting']","['Fourier ptychographic microscopy', 'intensity fluctuation', 'phase retrieval', 'intensity correction', 'image quality']"
"In this paper, we propose a dynamic adaptive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) free space optical (FSO) system with spatial mode switching. Based on the channel conditions, the proposed system can select different MIMO transmission modes: diversity, multiplexing or hybrid mode that yields the maximum average channel capacity while satisfying the reliable average bit error rate (BER). Considering the combined effects of path loss, pointing error and atmospheric turbulence-induced fading modeled by Malaga distribution, we derive the closed-form expressions of average channel capacity and average BER of MIMO system for each transmission mode. From adaptive system performance evaluated results, we establish the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold look-up table (LUT) in different scenarios to select the optimal transmission mode. The extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive system has a significant improvement in average channel capacity compared with each stand-alone mode system. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation is also provided to verify the correctness of the proposed adaptive scheme and conclusions.","['Atmospheric modeling', 'MIMO communication', 'Adaptive systems', 'Adaptation models', 'Fading channels', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Probability density function']","['Wireless optical communication', 'adaptive transmission', 'composite atmospheric channel', 'MIMO', 'average channel capacity', 'average bit error rate']"

"The synthesis of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) by flame aerosol is of great significance to realize industrial large-scale production of UCNPs and develop nanotechnology further. Here, for the first time, we successfully fabricated the ultrasmall Y 2 O 3 :Yb 3+ /Ho 3+ UCNPs by a self-build swirl flame spray pyrolysis (SFSP) method with a high production rate of ∼40 g \cdot h −1 . These flame-made UCNPs are all pure cubic phases with an average ultrasmall size of ∼14 nm. Excited by 980 nm laser, the synthesized UCNPs show bright green ( 2 F 4 , 5 S 2 → 5 I 8 ) and relatively weak red ( 5 F 5 → 5 I 8 ) upconversion luminescence (UCL). Based on the UCL spectra of Y 2 O 3 :Yb 3+ /Ho 3+ UCNPs, the optimal doping concentrations of 6 mol% Yb 3+ and 0.1 mol% Ho 3+ were determined to reach the most intense UCL. The dependence of UCL intensity and pump power was further analyzed, and it indicated that the green and red UCL are two-photon processes. In addition, the UCL properties with different synthesized conditions were also demonstrated. The UCL mechanism of these flame-made Y 2 O 3 :Yb 3+ /Ho 3+ UCNPs were illustrated in detail.

A new microwave photonic signal processing structure for realising in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) mixing is presented. It is based on a dual-drive Mach Zehnder modulator (DDMZM) and an optical phase modulator inside a Sagnac loop interferometer. Two output IF signals with a quadrature phase difference are obtained by using two photodetectors to detect the upper and lower sidebands of the optical signal at the Sagnac loop output. A quadrature phase difference in the two IF signals is realised by biasing the DDMZM at the quadrature point. This has the advantage of very little quadrature phase errors as a standard modulator bias controller can accurately lock the DDMZM bias point. The optical phase modulator driven by an RF signal can be placed in a remote location for antenna remoting. Theoretical analysis and simulation show using the proposed I/Q mixer for image rejection can overcome the modulation index dependent image rejection ratio problem in the reported I/Q mixers based on a cascaded modulator structure. The Sagnac loop based I/Q mixer is experimentally verified with results show only ±1° quadrature phase error and more than 50 dB image rejection ratio over the operating frequency range of 6 to 20 GHz.,"['Radio frequency', 'Mixers', 'Sagnac interferometers', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical polarization', 'Optical modulation', 'Microwave antennas']","['Microwave mixer', 'I/Q mixer', 'image rejection mixer', 'optical signal processing', 'optical modulator', 'remote antennas']"
"An all-optical format conversion and regeneration scheme about 4-ary amplitude and phase shift keying (4APSK) signals is proposed and numerically simulated based on nonlinear effects in the high nonlinear fiber (HNLF).

Secondly, a degenerate phase-sensitive amplification (PSA) based on the four-wave mixing (FWM) is utilized to convert the regular-QPSK into two binary phase shift keying (BPSK) signals. The nonlinear MZI configuration is also used to compress the amplitude noise of BPSK. Thirdly, one phase shifter and one variable optical attenuator (VOA) are used to adjust the relative phase and power relationships of the two amplitude-regenerated BPSK signals.

"The mid-infrared absorber is an important device for effective capture of high by atmospheric infrared transparent window, and has been a research hotspot in military, medical, biological and other fields. In this paper, a kind of ultra-thin mid-infrared ultra-broadband absorber with background insensitive is realized by stacking four metal/dielectric films (Si/Ag/Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 ) on silver substrate and periodically arranged cross-anchor metal pattern in a method of finite-difference time domain. The results show that the absorption rate is more than 90% and the relative absorption bandwidth is 95.5% in the wavelength ranging from 9.1 μm to 24.1 μm. The average absorptivity is 92% in the range of background refractive index ( n = 1∼1.8), A proof of the device's insensibility to background refractive index. At a large incidence angle (θ ≤ 50°), the lowest absorption rate is up to 80%. The thickness of the optimized device is only 1.7 μm.

"Owing to an additional thinner planar waveguide with micron scale is attracted to the symmetrical metal cladding waveguide (SMCW) with sub-millimeter scale, the interference interaction between different Q-value guided modes would generate a Fano reflectivity curve. In our double metal-dielectric-metal waveguides (DMDMW) structure, a Kerr nonlinear medium is located in the guiding layer of the SMCW where the excited oscillating wave is enormously enhanced. Numerical calculations show that a minute variation of the incident light intensity will give rise to a change in the dielectric constant of the Kerr nonlinear medium and lead to positive feedback. A bistable reflection can be achieved with a low threshold and a large modulation depth because of the sharpness and the asymmetricity of the Fano reflectivity curve.","['Reflectivity', 'Dielectric constant', 'Optical waveguides', 'Optical bistability', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Optical scattering', 'Optical reflection']","['Optical bistability', 'physical optics']"

"A microwave photonic mixer for up- and down-conversion based on dual parallel in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) modulators is proposed. Dual parallel I/Q modulators and 90-degree electrical hybrid couplers are used to obtain carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation of radio frequency (RF), intermediate frequency (IF), and local oscillator (LO) signals. The optical bandpass filter (OBPF) is employed to select the -1st-order or +1st-order sideband of the LO signal to realize up and down conversion. In the experiments, an IF frequency range of 5-17 GHz can be upconverted to an RF frequency range of 15-37 GHz, and an RF frequency range of 8-40 GHz can be downconverted to an IF frequency range of 2-5 GHz. The spurs suppression ratio exceeds 50 dB for up and down conversion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported spurs suppression in a broadband microwave photonic mixer. Moreover, the OBPF is also utilized to obtain an image rejection ratio (IRR) of 45.91 dB at an IF frequency of 4 GHz. To obtain a lower frequency of IF signal and a higher IRR, a Brillouin-assisted notch filter is applied to attenuate the image signal. In this way, an IRR of more than 60 dB can be obtained at an IF frequency of 2 GHz.","['Radio frequency', 'Optical imaging', 'Frequency modulation', 'Optical filters', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical pumping', 'Mixers']","['Frequency conversion', 'image rejection mixer', 'microwave photonics', 'stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS)']"

"Herein, we theoretically demonstrate a broadband hybrid plasmonic electro-absorption optical modulator with integrated silver nanoribbons. Wehave examined two structures. The first one includes two layers of graphene and two layers of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Silver nanoribbons are placed on the Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS 2 ) layer. In the second structure, we covered the nanoribbon arrays with extra graphene, MoS 2 , and h-BN layers. The effect of the gap between the silver nanoribbons is analyzed for the effective refractive index, modulation depth (MD), Extinction Ratio (ER), Figure of Merit (FoM), and loss.

"Computer-generated hologram (CGH) is a diffractive optical element that has been commonly used as wavefront corrector in the interferometer and can be accurately manufactured to meet the requirements of high-precision detection. But the transmitted wavefront error (TWE) of the CGH substrate and the adjustment errors of cylindrical surface are influence factors of high accuracy measurement. In this paper, we propose the method of calibrating the CGH substrate TWE. After calibrating, the substrate TWE is 0.0052λ (RMS). Meanwhile, we obtain the general expression for the misalignment aberrations by describing the relationship between the wavefront of the measured cylindrical mirror and the corresponding adjustment errors. Then the adjustment errors of the test cylindrical surface can be completely separated by subtracting the fitting function from the measurement on the basis of least-square algorithm. After that, the PV value changes from 3.0565λ to 0.9825λ, and the RMS value changes from 0.5278λ to 0.1273λ, the measurement results have been greatly improved.","['Measurement uncertainty', 'Substrates', 'Measurement by laser beam', 'Optical surface waves', 'Surface waves', 'Rotation measurement', 'Optical variables measurement']","['Adjustment errors', 'CGH', 'cylindrical mirror', 'transmitted wavefront error']"
"Liquid-crystal spatial light modulator (LC-SLM) has been widely applied as a programmable digital device. However, the LC-SLM can only manipulate on light fields accurately under designated wavelengths since, when being uploaded a specific grayscale image onto it, the phase retardance offered by the LC-SLM is relevant to the wavelength of the incident light. This means that the calibration of LC-SLM is indispensable once the working wavelength changes. In this paper, based on a phase retrieval algorithm, a novel phase calibration method with high efficiency and accuracy is proposed for scaling LC-SLM. In the method, a 1-D phase retrieval algorithm for recovering the phase of a 1-D light field distribution is used to measure the voltage-phase characteristic curve of LC-SLM, where the gradient descent algorithm with a Root Mean Square propagation is introduced to obtain the phase. Simulations and experiments show that this method is stable and has the ability of anti-noise on some conditions and can eliminate the influence caused by crosstalk between pixels on the calibration. Compared with the traditional diffraction-based method, our method improves the calibration error up to 30% under the same experimental conditions.","['Voltage measurement', 'Calibration', 'Diffraction', 'Phase modulation', 'Phase measurement', 'Gray-scale', 'Light fields']","['Spatial light modulator', 'far-field diffraction', 'phase retrieval algorithm']"
"The efficient and cost-effective suppression of atmospheric turbulence effects in free-space optical (FSO) communication poses a significant challenge. To address this challenge, a carrier frequency offset estimation (FOE) scheme based on frame-synchronous training sequence (FSTS) is proposed, which can be applied to spatial diversity polarization multiplexing (PM) coherent FSO communication system. The proposed scheme integrates the functions of frame synchronization (FS) and FOE by designing distinct training sequences for the X and Y polarizations. Specifically, the FOE scheme achieves high accuracy, wide range, low complexity, and multi-format versatility while maintaining FS accuracy. Simulation results for PM 4/16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) demonstrate the feasibility and generality of the proposed scheme. Moreover, when combined with the spatial diversity reception under strong and weak turbulence conditions, the proposed algorithm exhibits higher receiver sensitivity compared to the conventional training sequence (TS)-based FOE algorithm. The advantages of this scheme make it highly promising for high-speed coherent FSO communications across multiple modulation formats.","['Estimation', 'Complexity theory', 'Training', 'Symbols', 'Signal processing algorithms', 'Frequency estimation', 'Spatial diversity']","['Free-space optical', 'frame synchronization', 'frequency offset estimation', 'atmospheric turbulence', 'quadrature amplitude modulation', 'training sequence']"

"The characteristics of backscattered electrons near the surface of a back-side bombarded CMOS (BSB-CMOS) within an electron bombarded CMOS (EBCMOS) were studied based on the principle of electron-solid interactions and Monte-Carlo simulation method. We mainly focused on the angular distributions of backscattered electrons, the ratio of backscattered electron number to incident electron number (RBI), and the distribution of the distance between backscattered electrons and incident electrons ( D BI ). We studied how these characteristics were affected by the BSB-CMOS surface structure and incident electron energy. Firstly, RBI and the mean D BI vary with the incident electron energy, the surface material type, and passivation layer thickness. Meanwhile, a lower RBI may reduce device noise originating from backscattered electrons ( N BE ) due to the smaller number of backscattered electrons. Besides, the lower mean D BI may enhance the device resolution, because the backscattered electron beam is more concentrated. The distribution of backscattered azimuths ( {\it \Phi}_{\rm B} ) and the backscattered angle ( θ B ) follow uniform distribution and cosine angular distribution respectively, which are difficult to change. Finally, devices with the lowest RBI and a low mean value of D BI were achieved when the BSB-CMOS surface was modified with 60 nm Al 2 O 3 and the incident electrons were at 4 keV, which might improve the N BE and resolution of the EBCMOS.

"Recent salient object detection methods are mainly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Most of them adopt a U-shape architecture to extract and fuse multi-scale features. The coarser-level semantic information is progressively transmitted to finer-level layers through continuous upsampling operations, and the coarsest-level features will be diluted, resulting in the salient object boundary being blurred. On the other hand, the hand-craft feature has the advantage of being purposive and easy to calculate, in which the edge density feature may help improve the sharpness of the salient object boundary by the rich edge information. In this paper, we propose a Co-Guided Attention Network (CoGANet). On the base of the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), our model implements a co-guided attention mechanism between the image itself and its edge density feature. In the bottom-up pathway of FPN, two streams separately work, taking the original image and its edge density feature as inputs, and each producing five feature maps. Then the last feature map in each stream generates a set of attention maps through a Multi-scale Spatial Attention Module (MSAM). In the top-down pathway, the attention maps of one stream are directly delivered to each stage in the other stream. These attention maps are fused with the feature maps by an Attention-based Feature Fusion Module (AFFM). Finally, an accurate saliency map is produced by fusing the finest-level outputs of the two streams. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate our model is superior to 13 state-of-the-art methods in terms of four evaluation metrics.","['Feature extraction', 'Object detection', 'Streaming media', 'Image edge detection', 'Semantics', 'Data mining', 'Fuses']","['Salient object detection', 'Convolutional Neural Networks', 'Spatial attention', 'Hand-craft feature']"

"The existing approach for evaluating the statistical characteristics of speckle intensity distribution is applicable only to completely decorrelated laser beams. In the current study, a theoretical method based on a coherent matrix is developed for evaluating the first-order speckle statistics of partially correlated beams. A rigorous analytical formula for the calculation of speckle contrast is obtained based on the proposed coherent matrix method. Subsequently, an approximate analysis model of the speckle intensity distribution in a laser spot illuminated by partially correlated beams is proposed. The simulation results show that the accuracy of the approximate analysis model increases with the number of beams and is acceptable for practical application, even for a small number of beams. Applications of the proposed method are presented for analyzing two different optical schemes for speckle suppression. It is shown that the developed theoretical method is straightforward and effective for the analysis of light intensity statistics of laser spots illuminated by partially correlated beams.

"The step-index heavily germanium-doped silica fibers with all normal dispersion (ANDi) are promising candidates for highly coherent supercontinuum (SC).

"Compared with normal color vision observers (NOs), anomalous trichromats (AT) have anomalous color vision responses owing to differences in cone sensitivity. The wide-color-gamut display provides a promising solution to this problem. Herein, we propose a color discrimination experiment based on a wide-color-gamut display. The observers’ abilities to discern colors in various color directions were tested. The experimental findings were confirmed by simulations based on the shifting of the photopigments spectral absorption. It is concluded that the wide-color-gamut display significantly improves the color perception ability of AT, while proper light source optimization significantly enhances the visualization of AT. The study findings show that this AT-based, color vision model, may open up opportunities for future visual perception and biomedical applications.","['Color', 'Image color analysis', 'Observers', 'Sensitivity', 'Visualization', 'Pigments', 'Light sources']","['Anomalous trichromats', 'color discrimination', 'color gamut volume', 'laser display']"

"We present a hybrid chirped pulse amplification (CPA) laser system based on Yb-doped fiber and Yb:YAG thin rod. The laser system demonstrates a novel approach to generate high average power up to the 100-W level by using a Yb:YAG thin rod without pump guiding at room temperature. A Yb-doped all-fiber laser with an output power of 7 W and a repetition rate of 1 MHz is amplified to an output power of 126.2 W in simple and compact two-stage amplifiers consisting of a single fiber crystal (SCF) and a Yb:YAG thin rod. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest output power of Yb:YAG thin-rod amplifier with good beam quality obtained without pump guiding at room temperature. After using a thin-film polarizer (TFP) to remove the thermal depolarization, a linearly polarized ultrashort pulse laser with an average power of 115.2 W is obtained. An output power of 80.6 W with a pulse width of 580 fs is achieved after pulse compression.

"The 2 µm waveband is capable of enabling pervasive applications. The demonstration of the hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber and the thulium-doped fiber amplifier has highlighted the fiber propagation and amplification aspects of fiber communications, indicating its potential as an adjunct to present communication infrastructure at the O/C bands. The above is especially imperative given the current concerns with regards to the upper bandwidth limit of the single-mode fiber. Furthermore, the waveband could facilitate many more applications such as LIDAR and free-space communication. However, water absorption (OH - ) is high at most of the 2 μm waveband and this will impact the optical insertion loss of applications implemented in the wavelength region. The relative low water absorption region of the waveband falls within 1950 – 2000 nm. As such, the development of a hybrid/heterogeneous III-V/silicon laser source that operates within the region is important for 2 µm silicon photonics. In this work, we demonstrate a III-V/Si hybrid tunable laser operating from 1955 - 1992 nm for the first time. Room temperature continuous wave operation is achieved with a maximum laser output power of 8.1 mW. This wavelength-tunable laser operates specifically within the low water absorption window, indicating good wavelength suitability for applications at the 2 μm waveband.","['Optical waveguides', 'Optical fiber amplifiers', 'Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers', 'Semiconductor optical amplifiers', 'Semiconductor lasers', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Waveguide lasers']","['2 µm silicon photonics', 'hybrid III-V/silicon lasers', 'integrated optics', 'tunable lasers']"

"Short reach optical communications are desperate for cost-effective solutions to improve capacity and compatibility in dealing with massive access and applications. Single sideband-direct detection (SSB-DD) is highly recognized for improving capacity with single PD, but it is confronted with signal-signal beating interference (SSBI). Recently, a DC-Value method has been proposed for optical signal phase retrieval for single carrier signal transmission. To further explore the effectiveness and compatibility of DC-Value method, in this letter for the first time, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based multi-carrier modulation formats are processed by the DC-Value method in the receiver. Simulation results demonstrate that, for both OFDM and Nyquist-shaped single carrier (SC), the DC-Value method is beneficial in applying lower sampling rate to achieve comparable transmission performance than that of Kramers-Kronig receiver. In addition, althrough OFDM holds 2 dB increment of the optimum carrier-signal power ratio (CSPR) than Nyquist-SC, it offers more robustness to fibre transmission.","['OFDM', 'Optical receivers', 'Amplitude modulation', 'Optical noise', 'Adaptive optics', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Signal to noise ratio']","['Kramers-Kronig', 'DC-value method', 'OFDM', 'Nyquist single carrier']"
"To mitigate the temperature dependence of the resonance frequency in microcavities, athermal photonic devices have been developed by incorporating materials with an opposite thermo-optical coefficient (TOC). Here, we conduct an experimental demonstration of the athermal effect in a microbubble resonator, employing an aluminum (Al) holder for its mounting. By converting the thermal expansion of the holder into controlled geometry adjustments in the microbubble resonator, we achieve athermal optical modes at a specific temperature. The athermal compensation is accomplished by counterbalancing the pulling force resulting from the thermal expansion of the Al holder against the thermal characteristics of the material, specifically SiO 2 . Especially, the optical modes located around the equator are particularly susceptible to the influence of the pulling force exerted by the Al holder. This temperature-insensitive feature of the resonance establishes a new avenue towards athermal microresonator through this special structure.","['Resonant frequency', 'Microcavities', 'Force', 'Electron tubes', 'Optical sensors', 'Optical device fabrication', 'Thermal noise']","['Whispering gallery mode', 'thermal effect', 'athermal microresonator']"
"In this study, we reported a complex-signal-based optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) method, called complex correlated phase gradient variance (CCPGV), for mapping high-quality microvascular images. The performance of the newly proposed algorithm is benchmarked against the previously reported phase-resolved Doppler variance, complex differential variance (CDV), and split-spectrum amplitude and phase-gradient angiography (SSAPGA), by both tissue phantoms experiments and in vivo human skin measurements. Compared to the phase-resolved Doppler variance, CCPGV can intrinsically reject undesirable phase shifts caused by bulk motion and trigger jitter. In contrast to CDV and SSAPGA, which are insensitive to phase instability, CCPGV can provide superior motion contrast, as demonstrated by ∼1.4 and 3 times higher contrast in phantom experiments respectively. An increase of 27.3% and 106.3% were found in vivo experiments for CCPGV, making it easier to distinguish vessels from the background static. Benefiting from the advantages, more vessels and better connectivity can be visualized in the en -face angiogram processed by the CCPGV method.

"Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) of light has attracted enormous interest for its potential applications in controlling light at nanoscale and holds promise for future optical information technology and optoelectronics. In particular, the transverse spin in evanescent waves is regarded as distinct manifestation of SOI and an emerging candidate for miniaturizing optoelectronic circuits. However, further application has been hampered by the inability to conveniently generate light field with configurable transverse spin. Here, we present a simple method to generate free-space light field with arbitrary transverse spin utilizing vector beam interference and numerically demonstrate the configurable spin orbital coupling in nanophotonic waveguide. Chiral waveguide with excellent extinction ratio up to 42 dB is achieved in our simulation.

"Digital holography is a promising candidate for advanced display, although several obstacles remain, such as the problem of heavy time consumption in the generation of phase-only holograms. Recently, deep-learning-based methods have achieved the real-time generation of holograms while maintaining high image quality. However, the holograms created with deep neural networks can reproduce images only at a specific distance because their target depth is fixed in the training process. This paper suggested and demonstrated a deep neural network that can continuously control the depth of the phase-only hologram. The network takes a target depth and an input image and generates a phase-only hologram. We added a depth embedding block that moves the hologram latent vector depending on the target depth. Thus, we can change the location of the image plane without retraining. The numerical and optical experiments show that the network understands the relationship between the depth and the appearance of the phase-only hologram. As a result, phase-only holograms generated with the proposed network can reconstruct images with around 25-dB PSNR.","['Training', 'Image reconstruction', 'Neural networks', 'Three-dimensional displays', 'Holography', 'Optical imaging', 'Holographic optical components']","['Holography', 'phase-only hologram', 'deep neural network', 'depth embedding block', 'hologram latent space']"

"High-resolution optical spectroscopy is a significant approach to reveal the inherent laws of devices and systems. Although optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) based on stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) has achieved a resolution of ∼10pm, when the signal power increases, the Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) will saturate and cause resolution degradation. In order to solve this problem, we introduce shape factor k to describe the variation of BGS with signal power, and adopt the BGS as the point spread function (PSF). Then the signal is divided into several intervals with equal frequency spacing, where the BGS does not change. On this basis, we perform the Jansson-Van Cittert (JVC) algorithm to complete deconvolution in each interval with power variable PSF. The proposed method is used to test the periodic signal in SBS-OSA. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the spectral resolution from 22MHz to 11MHz when the frequency interval is 14MHz and the signal power is -5dBm.","['Signal resolution', 'Optical distortion', 'Shape', 'Optical pumping', 'Optical polarization', 'Degradation', 'Scattering']","['Deconvolution', 'power variable PSF', 'resolution degradation', 'SBS-based OSA', 'gain saturation']"

"The radially polarized beams are modulated by phase-type optical needle modulators can be tightly focused to create needle-like focused beams, which are called optical needles. The use of optical needles with different resolutions and focal depths as direct writing heads for laser direct lithography enables periodic, cross-scale processing of high aspect ratio micro-nano structures with different line widths. The design of the phase-type optical needle modulators is the key to obtain optical needles with different resolutions and focal depths. However, the existing conventional methods for designing phase-type optical needle modulators rely on the physical model for generating optical needles and the defined fitness function, which makes their design time long and not adaptive. Based on the deep learning, a novel phase-type optical needle modulator design (PONMD) approach is proposed in this paper. The results show that the PONMD method takes 0.5526ms to design a phase-type optical needle modulator, and the similarity between the designed and target values is 96.73%.

"Low polarization-dependent semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) with an easy fabrication process and the capability to be co-integrated with passive elements are crucial in photonic integrated circuits. In this work, we design, simulate, and optimize a low polarization-dependent bulk SOA based on a novel layerstack with an unstrained bulk active layer with a robust and easy fabrication process that allows the co-integration with passive waveguides. The designed layerstack shows that the reflection between SOA and the passive waveguide is less than 1.3 × 10 −5 . Furthermore, by designing the ridge waveguide and layerstack (thickness of the core and cladding layers), the confinement factor of TE- and TM- modes (Г TE / TM ) are engineered to be approximately the same. This results in a low polarization-dependent SOA (since for the active bulk layer, the material gain of TE-mode is very close to the material gain of TM-mode). Numerical assessment of different length SOAs in terms of gain, polarization-dependent gain (PDG), noise figure are extensively investigated. Moreover, a booster SOA (1100 μm) with higher output saturation power has been investigated by widening the width of SOA from 1 μm to 3 μm. The output saturation power at 10 kA/cm 2 increases from +7.6 dBm to +13.9 dBm, when the width of the SOA waveguide increases from 1 μm to 3 μm.

Moreover, the relationship between the relative change of the F-P cavity length and pneumatic pressure, as well as the relationship between the duration of the relative change of the F-P cavity length and the frequency are analyzed comprehensively.

Under both weak and moderate turbulence conditions, at the receiving power −2.8 dBm, the measured BER of the eavesdropper exceeds 0.1, which is larger than the BER threshold of soft-decision forward error correction code.

"In the process of designing and adjusting the solar simulator, the side lobe effect and aberration of the optical integrator affect the irradiation uniformity, an integrating sphere is proposed to replace the optical integrator for uniform light and the compound parabolic reflector for beam shaping. First, based on the equal illuminance theorem and the radiation transfer theory, the calculation formula of the energy transmission efficiency of the porous integrating sphere is derived; Then, the light hole illuminance interference factor is introduced, and the effects of the aperture size of the integrating sphere, the radius of the integrating sphere, and the size and position of the baffle on the energy transmission efficiency and irradiation uniformity are analyzed. Finally, an integrating sphere uniform light system with high energy transmission efficiency and uniformity is designed and simulated with LightTools software. The simulation results show that: the average difference of irradiation uniformity and the range difference of irradiation uniformity are closest to 1 in the area where the ratio of the opening size and radius of the integrating sphere is 36%–40%, and the light is evenly distributed; When the baffle position is 0.8 times of integrating sphere radius away from the light entrance hole, irradiation non-uniformity at the outlet hole is 1.99%, which is the best position of the baffle; In the effective irradiation surface of Φ1032 mm, the irradiation non-uniformity is 1.98%, and the maximum irradiance is 0.62 solar constants, the spot simulation with high irradiation uniformity on large irradiation surface is realized.","['Radiation effects', 'Integrated optics', 'Optical reflection', 'Adaptive optics', 'Optical imaging', 'Lenses', 'Optical sensors']","['Solar simulation', 'integrating sphere', 'energy transmission efficiency', 'irradiation non-uniformity', 'large irradiation surface']"

"A miniature optical subassembly module incorporating a pair of collimating and focusing lenses was proposed and designed to provide affordable alignment tolerance in terms of optical coupling efficiency. The light source was specifically modeled taking advantage of multiple point sources placed on the emitting aperture. This scheme was practically verified to be superior to the conventional scheme involving a single point source by estimating the focal length and spot size of a focused beam. The performance of the proposed source modeling was scrutinized with respect to the number of point sources. The optical coupling of the subassembly to a fiber was investigated theoretically and experimentally in light of the characteristics of the displacement of the focused beam relative to the lateral displacement of the light source. Finally, a tradeoff between the positional 3-dB tolerance of the light source and the maximum available coupling efficiency was established with certitude.","['Light sources', 'Optical coupling', 'Lenses', 'Optical fibers', 'Apertures', 'Couplings']","['Micro-optics', 'optical interconnects', 'fiber optic systems', 'applications', 'theory and design']"

"The precise luminous intensity control for liquid crystal display (LCD) backlight units is an important issue that has not been well addressed in current research. A proper luminous intensity distribution can significantly enhance the viewing experience. In this paper, we propose a method for designing a freeform micro lens array that is capable of producing a prescribed luminous intensity distribution for direct-lit LED backlight module. As the luminous intensity distribution is usually need to be constrained within a quadrilateral pyramid region, a special coordinate system is developed by scanning two semicircles containing light rays along the X axis and Y axis to provide a flexible model for luminous intensity tailoring. Further, we convert the luminous intensity design problem to a specific illuminance problem by using a lossless energy conversion strategy. Then, an integrable ray mapping between the source domain and the target domain is established to implement the freeform optics design to regulate the converted illuminance distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via various design examples including on-axis configuration and axis-off configuration, the influence of the LED size on the optical performance is also analyzed.","['Liquid crystal displays', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Light sources', 'Optics', 'Lighting', 'Lenses', 'Optical imaging']","['Backlight system', 'freeform optics design', 'LED', 'micro lens array']"

"With the development of electric vehicles, indoor driving robots, wearable devices, etc., research on technology for recognizing one's current location continues to progress. Self-localization is an essential need for autonomous driving and mainly requires global positioning system (GPS), thereby using technologies such as LiDAR, Wi-Fi, and visible light communication (VLC). However, GPS is greatly affected by its surrounding environment, and it can make errors, especially in spaces where signals are blocked, such as tunnels and buildings. In this paper, we propose a system for estimating one's location using LED lights and frequency components with different color temperatures in an indoor space such as a tunnel. We installed three types of LED lights with different color temperatures in a tunnel-like experimental environment and collected data using RGB sensors. We also estimated the user's current location according to the color temperature and frequency component analysis from the data. In most cases, it was measured within a margin of error of 0–2 cm. It is expected that this will be used for generating data on the location of indoor service robots and autonomous vehicles in spaces where it is difficult to use GPS.","['Color', 'Temperature measurement', 'Temperature sensors', 'Image color analysis', 'Global Positioning System', 'Sensors', 'Light emitting diodes']","['Chromaticity', 'correlated color temperature (CCT)', 'indoor positioning systems', 'LED']"
"Fluorescence immunochromatographic assay (FICA) is a quantitative detection technique widely used in clinical diagnosis, environmental monitoring, and food safety. To deal with the limited applications caused by insufficient detection range, this paper proposes a photoelectric adjustment system suitable for FICA strip readers to expand its detection range. The photoelectric adjustment system is proposed based on the relationship between the excitation light intensity and the fluorescence intensity, which provides the optimal excitation light intensity and a stable baseline amplitude for the FICA strip reader. To verify the proposed system, it was applied to the strip reader we had previously developed. The results show that the linear detection range of the FICA strip reader was extended from 1.95-256 μg/mL to 1-1024 μg/mL after using the proposed method. At the same time, the accuracy of the FICA strip reader does not deteriorate and is in good comparisons with the conventional ESEQuant Lateral Flow Reader (with R 2 > 0.9987). Therefore, the proposed photoelectric adjustment method and system can improve the detection range of the strip reader or other similar devices.",[],[]

"We propose a two-level dimmer based on binary distribution matching where a low-rate signal controls the output probability distribution of a high-rate bit sequence, which can be used in region-of-interest (RoI) signaling applications. To reduce the rate loss of the dimmer, we propose the extended multiset-partition distribution matching (EMPDM) algorithm with a novel binary-tree-structure implementation. In addition, we introduce 4p-EMPDM, a compact version of EMPDM, which has a typical composition (TC) and four leading composition pairs (CPs). The codebook of 4p-EMPDM includes only run-length-aware codewords, which reduces the maximum run-length of the transmitted bit sequence by 4.27 times. Hence, it guarantees flicker mitigation for visible-light RoI signaling systems at 6 kHz without using any run-length limited code (non-RLL). Using experimental data collected from the low-rate RoI signaling prototype, we introduced a threshold range where both intensity and area information of the received training symbols can be exploited to optimize the shaping ratios of the 4p-EMPDM dimmer. Because of the non-RLL feature, the proposed system can support soft-decision forward-error-correction (FEC) decoding to improve reliability.

"We theoretically investigate dynamics of dark pulse and Raman-Kerr microcombs generation influenced by higher-order effects, including high-order dispersion (HOD), stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and self-steepening (SS) effects in silicon microresonators. These three effects cause the delay of dark pulse individually, or interact with each other to alter the drift velocity and direction of pulses. HOD effect can change pulse shift direction and even cause bifurcation. The temporal drift induced by SS or SRS effects could be balanced by the simultaneous third-order dispersion (TOD) engineering. In spectral domain, stable Raman-Kerr frequency comb will be generated due to the competition between strong SRS and Kerr effects. The Raman comb components are suppressed when HOD effect coexists, while SS effect has ignorable effect on the distribution of the Raman comb. Furthermore, the SS effect will increase the total energy of the spectrum by shifting the dispersive wave (DW) generation to the longer wavelength side. Our findings could deepen the understanding of intracavity nonlinear dynamics and provide theoretical guidance to precisely control the stabilization of dark pulse and the generation of broadband mid-infrared (MIR) microcomb.","['Microcavities', 'Dispersion', 'Silicon', 'Solitons', 'Mathematical models', 'Oscillators', 'Kerr effect']","['Dark pulse', 'high-order dispersion', 'stimulated Raman scattering', 'self-steepening']"

"Hollow waveguide (HWG) as an absorption cell for gas spectral sensing has the advantages of low transmission loss, fast response speed, and high path length to volume ratio. However, due to the tubular structure of the HWG, the spontaneous emission generated in the HWG will be transmitted together with the incident laser, which reduces the measured absorbance. We measured and verified the spontaneous emission at the outlet of the HWG by basing on the laser gas absorption spectroscopy and combining with the distinguished polarization characteristics of laser and spontaneous emission. Then, we quantitatively determined the intensity distribution of the spontaneous emission output from the HWG based on the infrared (IR) imaging using an IR camera. We also investigated the effect of the spontaneous emission on the measured absorbance as a function of the HWG length by comparative experiments. The effect exponentially decreases as the HWG length increases since the increased loss. The method could be used for designing or optimizing of HWG-based sensors.","['Spontaneous emission', 'Measurement by laser beam', 'Length measurement', 'Absorption', 'Quantum cascade lasers', 'Gas lasers', 'Distributed feedback devices']","['Hollow waveguide', 'spectral sensing', 'spontaneous emission', 'effective path length']"

A hybrid silicon/aluminum nitride waveguide on the silicon-on-insulator platform is proposed to achieve an efficient Brillouin optomechanical interaction. Both intra-optical-mode and inter-optical-mode Brillouin scattering can be achieved. The novel arrangement of symmetric electrodes provides out-of-plane electric fields for piezoelectric materials and the possibility of suspended waveguides and cavities. The piezomechanical interaction coupling strength and the Brillouin optomechanical interaction coupling strength are numerically calculated. The simulation results show that near-unity internal conversion efficiency from the microwave domain to the optical domain can be achieved. Relatively low microwave power can be used to produced up to 5 order sidebands acousto-optical modulation.

"We propose an efficient scheme of optical pumping and a compact design of an optically-pumped semiconductor optical amplifier (OP-SOA), with gain characteristics which are qualitatively similar to that of conventional (electrically-pumped) SOA. The optical pump is coupled into the ‘active waveguide’ from an adjacent channel waveguide, called ‘pump waveguide’; by suitably tailoring the coupling between the two waveguides, selective transfer of pump power all along the active waveguide can be achieved. We show that optical pumping through the coupled-waveguide configuration is efficient over the existing schemes of optical pumping in semiconductors. The optical pump can be coupled into the pump waveguide through a separate fiber-pigtail, just as the signal is coupled to the active waveguide in commercially available SOA. Thus, the OP-SOA would be a stand-alone 3-port integrated optical device, without any electrical connections. The proposed scheme enables optical-to-optical gain control, in place of the current-controlled gain in conventional SOA. Performance characteristics of the OP-SOA are simulated for an InGaAsP/InP heterostructure device using a well-established model. It is found that for an input optical pump power of 25 dBm at the wavelength of 1310 nm, a small signal gain >30 dB is achieved at the wavelength of 1550 nm.","['Optical waveguides', 'Optical pumping', 'Semiconductor optical amplifiers', 'Optical coupling', 'Semiconductor waveguides', 'Optical fibers', 'Couplings']","['Optical pumping', 'semiconductor optical amplifiers', 'waveguide coupling']"

"Transmission matrix can be used as an elegant tool to represent the light transmission characteristics of a scattering medium. In this paper, we propose a novel common path interferometer technique to measure the transmission matrix utilizing the polarization rotation of incident beam.

By rotating the polarization of the incident beam, the ratio between the powers of signal and reference light can be freely adjusted and balanced. The phase shift method is employed to retrieve the transmission matrix of scattering medium. Once the transmission matrix is known, the polarization of the incident light beam can be rotated to switch off the reference and only the signal will remain.

"To figure out the energy attenuation of micro/nanofibers (MNFs) more flexibly and conveniently, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) is proposed to forecast the output intensity of rhodamine B (RhB) doped polymer microfibers (PMFs). According to the diameter, doping concentration, and propagation distance ( L ), we realize the L -dependence of output energy predictions for the excitation light ( IE ) and fluorescence ( IF ) of the doped PMFs. Hundreds of propagation distance-intensity data pairs acquired from dozens of RhB doped PMFs are used for the BPNN training. The prediction ability of the model is evaluated by the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and R 2 . The output intensity prediction performance of BPNN is compared with the traditional exponential-fitting (EF) method. The prediction results indicate that the two-hidden-layer network with one and seventeen neurons respectively provides the best performance. After training, BPNN gives a good intensity prediction for both the I E (RMSE = 3.16×10 −2 , MAPE = 7.3%, and R 2 = 0.9802) and the I F (RMSE = 0.91×10 −2 , MAPE = 0.89%, and R 2 = 0.9696) from the output end of the PMF with different diameters and doping concentrations. The energy losses of the two kinds of light from different doped PMFs are also calculated based on the predicted values, which are similar to the ones obtained from the EF method. The approach based on the BPNN prediction for the energy attenuation of the PMFs shows superiority in flexibility and applicability toward the traditional methods, which could promote the optimal design of the MNF devices and the practical application.","['Attenuation', 'Doping', 'Fluorescence', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical variables measurement', 'Energy loss', 'Optical imaging']","['Backpropagation neural network', 'dye-doped polymer microfiber', 'energy attenuation prediction']"
"All-optical control of silicon photonic devices plays a key role in on-chip all-optical computing, switching and signal processing. However, due to the weak intrinsic nonlinear effects of silicon, current integrated devices are limited by high power consumptions. Here, an all-optical controllable optomechanical microring resonator (OMMR) is proposed and fabricated on the silicon platform. Due to the mechanical Kerr effect induced by the optical gradient force (OGF), we realize seamless wavelength tuning over a range of 2.56 nm which is 61% of the free-spectral range, with a high tuning efficiency of 80 GHz/mW. By controlling the pump power, the OMMR indicates three working regions, which are the cutoff region, amplified region and saturate region. Accordingly, this function is similar to a transistor. Furthermore, the dynamic properties of the OMMR are investigated. By analyzing the dynamic responses, we demonstrate that the OMMR is driven by the OGF, rather than other nonlinear effects. The method simplifies the experimental setup, compared with measuring the intrinsic mechanical frequency of the OMMR.

"The stabilization and tracking performance of an image-based tip-tilt system is usually deteriorated by tip-tilt vibrations and beam jitter in optical links due to a limited tip-tilt correction bandwidth.

The enhanced repetitive controller is fused with the optimized observer based on Youla parameterization, which improves the stability of the closed-loop and reduces the waterbed effect in non-repetitive frequency. Furthermore, the time delay of the closed-loop system could be compensated by the OBRC. Therefore, disturbance suppressions can be transformed into the design of a repetitive controller, which is effective and easy to be used for tip-tilt vibrations and beam jitter suppression.

"The lower luminous efficiency is a critical issue for ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) owing to the poor carrier injection efficiency and high dislocation density. Here, we can improve the luminous efficiency in two avenues by adjusting the Al composition of the InGaN/Al x Ga 1-x N pre-well superlattice. First, due to the strain-induced piezoelectric and intrinsic spontaneous polarization, a large number of electrons gather at the InGaN/Al x Ga 1-x N interface, which improves the electron concentration of the pre-well superlattice and lowers the conduction band energy of the first quantum barrier layer (FQB), thus enhancing the electron injection efficiency. Second, the pre-well superlattice can act as a hole blocking layer to prevent holes from leaking into the n-type layer and confine them in the quantum well layer. As the Al composition increases, the hole blocking effect of the pre-well superlattice is strengthened. However, higher Al composition decreases the lattice quality, which makes it possible for carrier loss through defect-related non-radiative recombination. Finally, the output power of the samples with 5% Al composition in the pre-well superlattice is 5.9% and 102.5% higher than that of the samples with 3% and 7% Al composition, respectively.","['Superlattices', 'Licenses', 'Charge carrier processes', 'Research and development', 'Epitaxial growth', 'Wide band gap semiconductors', 'Two dimensional hole gas']","['Ultraviolet light-emitting diodes', 'hole blocking layer', 'superlattice', 'APSYS']"
"Coherent diffraction microscopy (CDM) is a potential approach to image micromaterials at atomic resolution without crystals. Due to the lack of high-angle scattering, the achieved resolution is limited to several nanometers. Small-angle scattering allows researchers to reveal high-resolution 3D structures of specimens by fitting 1D diffraction signals. However, prerequisite 3D models and non-unique solutions restrict the potential to image general specimens. Under the assumption of an ensemble containing large amounts of identical specimens with the same orientation, the intensity distribution of the diffraction pattern of the whole ensemble is approximated to the form factor of a single specimen multiplied by the number of identical specimens. Since the diffraction intensities are contributed from the whole ensemble, the signal can be significantly extended to high-frequency regions.

"The Degree of Polarization (DoP) of a light beam inside a medium contains unique information about the medium. 3D imaging techniques constitute an optimal procedure for determining the DoP under low light conditions, as the computational reconstruction process can increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected light. The definition of the DoP contains a division by the total number of detected photons from the sensor. However, under photon starved conditions, the number of detected photons at a single time period may be equal to zero. This may pose a division by zero problem for the computation of DoP.

"Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) optical wireless communication systems are potential candidates for high-speed data transmission in indoor environments. In this work, we present an experimental evaluation of two different MIMO systems, i.e., conventional-MIMO (c-MIMO) and imaging-MIMO (i-MIMO) in terms of design considerations. Both systems use the same transmitter configuration featuring a one-dimensional (light-emitting diode) LED transmitting array. On the receiver side, the c-MIMO system employs a similar one-dimensional receiving avalanche photodetector (APD)-based array, whereas the i-MIMO system uses a customized imaging camera-based receiver design. To assess the performance of the two systems, the channel matrix and the bit-error rate are calculated based on the experimental data. At distances shorter than 50 m, the proposed c-MIMO system demonstrates a good transmission performance, particularly when the maximum likelihood detection (MLD) technique is applied. Whereas, at long distances ranging from 40 m to 65 m, the proposed i-MIMO system can ensure an error-free transmission due to the efficient spatial separation between the emitted optical beams. Furthermore, the experimental results confirm that our systems have the potential for high data rates over longer distances in indoor environments.","['Optical transmitters', 'Optical signal processing', 'Optical receivers', 'Arrays', 'MIMO communication', 'Optical design', 'Optical pulses']","['Imaging receiver', 'linear array', 'optical wireless communications', 'OWC', 'optical wireless MIMO']"
"The compensation process for the state of polarization (SOP) from quantum signal plays an important role in the practical implementation of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). In contrast to the previous scheme using an expensive digital dynamic polarization controller, we choose a cheaper manual polarization controller interfaced with a digital algorithm based on Kalman filter to achieve compensation of the polarization loss under the condition that the SOP of the fiber is relatively stable. This paper also enumerates the details of other digital signal processing method to achieve final secret key rate. And a pilot-sequential Gaussian modulated coherent state (GMCS) continuous-variable quantum key distribution system with a local local oscillator (LLO) is experimentally implemented based on the analysis of excess noise. Finally, the experimental results show that the method of polarization loss compensation takes advantages in maintaining the stability of the final secret key rate. And a secret key rate of 110 kbps is achieved within 20 km optical fiber (with 4 dB loss) under the finite-size block of $1 \times {10^{6}}$ during a more extended time in the laboratory.","['Modulation', 'Protocols', 'Digital signal processing', 'Phase modulation', 'Local oscillators', 'Photonics', 'Optical polarization']","['State of polarization', 'continuous-variable quantum key distribution', 'pilot-sequential', 'Kalman filter', 'digital signal processing']"

The algorithm is based on the use of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) inside the coherent digital receiver. Two types of FFNNs were considered, the first based on a regression algorithm and the second based on a classification algorithm. Both FFNN algorithms are applied to features extracted from the histograms of the in-phase and quadrature components of the equalized digital samples.

"We experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, a method for arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) with time-bandwidth product (TBP) expansion beyond the limitations set by a spectral encoder. We show that, by using an anamorphic stretch transform with a specific group delay (GD) profile, one can boost the TBP of the generated electrical waveform in time-stretch AWG. In particular, we show that the TBP expansion can be achieved, depending on the signal sparsity and proper choice of the warped GD dispersion profile. The new waveform generation system is implemented here using a nonlinearly chirped fiber Bragg grating with a warped GD profile. Experimental demonstrations in this paper show a TBP expansion of more than three times above the maximum achievable using conventional methods.

"Mode instability (MI) has become a major factor that restricts the brightness enhancement of fiber laser. This paper studies the MI threshold characteristics of the fiber oscillators with refrigerated ytterbium-doped fiber (YDF). In the experiments, two fiber lasers that can operate at low temperature were built. We rigorously tested the MI threshold of the lasers with the YDF placed in two different environments. At room temperature environment, the MI threshold of the oscillator was measured with the temperature of the YDF water cooling plate ranging from 25 °C to 5 °C. When the cooling temperature of the YDF drops from 20 °C to 5 °C, the MI threshold of the laser rises gradually, but the increase is small. In another experiment, the YDF is assembled in a constant temperature test chamber, in which the cooling of the YDF is more efficient. It is found that as the cooling temperature drops, the MI threshold of the laser has an obvious upward trend. In the process of the cooling temperature of the YDF dropped from 20 °C to −10 °C, the MI threshold of the laser was increased from 867 W to above 931 W, an increase of nearly 10%. It is the first detailed experimental demonstration which shows that decreasing the cooling temperature of the gain fiber can indeed increase the MI threshold of the fiber oscillator. This work can clarify the influence of cooling temperature on the laser thermal effect, which is conducive to perfecting the theoretical model of the MI effect.","['Cooling', 'Fiber lasers', 'Power generation', 'Oscillators', 'Pump lasers', 'Power lasers', 'Laser modes']","['Cooling temperature', 'fiber laser', 'gain fiber', 'mode instability']"
"The thickness detection of quantum well has always been the research focus, especially for In x Ga 1-x As-based indium-rich cluster (IRC) structure, which has a thickness fluctuation of normal and indium-deficient InGaAs layers caused by IRC effect. In this paper, a simple and effective detection method for the special IRC structure is proposed by point-to-point acquisition. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra emitted from different In x Ga 1-x As positions are measured by moving the metal mask with a 0.2-mm-diameter light hole. By establishing the relationship between In x Ga 1-x As thickness and spectral intensity, the thickness fluctuation of normal In 0.17 Ga 0.83 As and indium-deficient In 0.12 Ga 0.88 As layers is determined by comparing the intensity of dual peaks. The dual peaks are typical feature of this IRC structure, which is caused by the migration of indium atoms. The significance of this experimental results is that it not only can detect the thickness distribution of In x Ga 1-x As materials with different x values, but also determine the critical thickness of indium atom migration in the growth of highly strained quantum well.","['Indium', 'Indium gallium arsenide', 'Strain', 'Gallium arsenide', 'Fluctuations', 'Thickness measurement', 'Photonic band gap']","['InGaAs', 'indium-rich cluster', 'indium atom migra- tion', 'thickness distribution']"
"A recent discovery of super-Planckian radiation in the far-field has attracted a great deal of interest in thermal radiation control using photonic crystals (PC) architecture. The finding is based on a careful comparison of radiation intensity emitted from a PC nano-filament and a blackbody at the same temperature and same wavelength at λ∼1.7 μm. Extending that finding, we determined the absolute spectral radiance of such a PC filament at λ∼1.7 μm at elevated temperature, T = 445–723 ° K, and compared its value to that predicted by Planck's blackbody radiation law. Our data confirmed that the PC spectral radiance surpassed that of a blackbody by an order-of-magnitude. We also determined the spectral emissivity of our PC filament and showed that its value far exceeded unity at resonance and fell below unity away from resonance. The observation of non-equality between absorptivity and emissivity suggests that a strong optical non-reciprocity takes place in our PC nano-filament.",[],[]

"Optical camera communication (OCC) is a type of visible light communication that employs a camera as the receiver. Various flicker-free OCC methods using a general-purpose low-frame rate camera have been proposed. In particular, the undersampling method uses a short exposure camera and a light-emitting diode that blinks faster than the camera's frame rate. Despite the short exposure time, the transmitter has to send a symbol for a frame period or longer because the relationship between the symbol timing of the transmitter and exposure timing of the receiver is indeterminate. We propose resolving this indeterminacy by synchronizing the exposure timing to the transmitter. In the proposed method, the transmitter sends multiple data channels in a frame period by time division multiplexing, and the receiver selects a channel. Then, a single symbol of multilevel phase shift keying is extracted from a single pixel value in a frame. Experiments confirmed that the exposure timing could be synchronized even with a degraded signal–noise ratio and that the receiver could select the desired channel. The proposed method achieved a bit error rate of 10^{-6} at a signal–noise ratio of 46.2 dB under various modulation schemes.","['Cameras', 'Demodulation', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Receivers', 'Radio transmitters', 'Synchronization', 'Symbols']","['Coherent demodulation', 'non-flickering communications', 'optical camera communication (OCC)', 'synchronization', 'visible light communications (VLC)']"
"Random numbers generated via quantum process is indeterministic, which are of essential to the cryptographic communication and the large-scale computer modeling. However, in realistic scenarios, classical noises can inevitably contaminate the raw sequences of a quantum randomness number generator (QRNG), and then compromise the security of the QRNG. Min-entropy is a useful approach that can quantify the randomness independent of side-information. To enhance the extractable randomness of the raw sequences arising from the QRNG, we propose a new method which exploits non-uniform quantization methods instead of uniform sampling methods and effectively enhances the extractable randomness from the QRNG at a high quantum-to-classical-noise ratio (QCNR). Given a QCNR as 50 dB and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), the worst-case conditional min-entropy of the non-uniform quantization scheme is improved by nearly 11% compared with that of the uniform sampling scheme.","['Quantization (signal)', 'Entropy', 'Detectors', 'Fluctuations', 'Sampling methods', 'Probability density function', 'Elementary particle vacuum']","['Quantum random-number generation', 'Min-entropy']"

"Deep neural networks have been successfully applied to forward predicting optical response and inverse designing topological structure of nanophotonic devices. However, the existing deep learning based methods need sufficient simulated data to train the model effectively. For those devices with complex structures that containing many design variables, obtaining enough training data through numerical simulations will become extremely time-consuming. In order to reduce the requirement of large amounts of training data, we present a new deep learning approach based on the Capsule Network in this paper. By employing the proposed model, we have designed and verified a series of silicon-based wavelength demultiplexer with more than one thousand design variables. The numerical simulations validate that the trained model can both effectively predict the optical response with a fixed topological structure, and inverse design the approximate topological structure for a needed given optical response. Comparison with the classical convolutional neural networks show that our model can obtain nearly the same performance when using only 60% of the training data.","['Nanoscale devices', 'Training data', 'Optical devices', 'Optical design', 'Neurons', 'Optical computing', 'Neural networks']","['Capsule network', 'forward prediction', 'inverse design', 'nanophotonic device']"

"The remarkable evolution of ytterbium-doped fiber (YDF) lasers and amplifiers is interrupted by a limiting thermo-optical effect called transverse mode instability (TMI).

"High-density and low-crosstalk waveguide arrays are critical components in optical phased arrays (OPAs) and are widely used in solid-state light detection and ranging (LiDAR). In this work, silicon nitride waveguide superlattices with air gaps are proposed and analyzed theoretically. Mode analysis shows that the introduced air gaps beside the waveguide help shorten the skin depth of the evanescent field and increase the effective index range of the waveguide under single mode conditions. Lower crosstalk is demonstrated between a pair of waveguides with air gaps compared with those without air gaps. On this basis, a waveguide superlattice with air gaps is designed by combining the eigenmode expansion method and particle swarm optimization. The crosstalk of the waveguide superlattice is optimized to −24.3 dB when the waveguide pitch is 0.9 \mu \text{m} , the propagation length is 1 mm, and the wavelength is 905 nm.

"We demonstrated highly-efficient pulsed mid-infrared generation based on intracavity difference frequency mixing inside a continuous-wave (CW) PPLN optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The near-infrared pulsed fiber source was located at 1120 nm with variable pulse width and repetition rate. The pump source of OPO was a CW linearly-polarized high-power 1060 nm fiber laser. The 1120 nm and 1060 nm pump beams were simultaneously incident into the OPO cavity.

"Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor of the biliary system. The structural characteristics of the bile duct tissue can reflect the changes in its function. The visualization of these specific features is of special significance for understanding the degree of invasion of HCC and tumor borders. Radical R0 resection is the only cure for HCC. Currently, the commonly used medical imaging diagnostic methods can only provide a rough tumor range and require a histopathological analysis. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) not only has an ultra-high spatial resolution but is also extremely sensitive to collagen fibers with noncentrosymmetric structures. In this study, MPM is applied to image the boundaries of HCC tumors. First, the experimental results show that MPM can clearly reveal the existence of residual cancer cells at the surgical margin. Second, the density of the collagen fibers and the dispersion of the 2D direction angle of the collagen fibers of normal and cancerous tissues are further calculated quantitatively. The collagen fiber signals before and after cancer cell invasion into the different tissues are found to be different. Finally, through a logistic regression prediction curve, combined with the collagen fiber density and 2D direction angle as indicators, it is further judged whether the resection margin is negative, which is closely related to the prognosis of HCC. The experimental results indicate that MPM imaging can serve as a new tool for diagnosing whether the HCC tumor boundary reaches R0 resection.","['Tumors', 'Cancer', 'Ducts', 'Imaging', 'Muscles', 'Optical fiber dispersion', 'Microscopy']","['Multiphoton microscopy', 'hilar cholangiocarci- noma', 'tumor boundary', 'collagen']"

"Laser energy cost is one of the primary energy budgets in integrated photonic switching systems. Traditional photonic switch testing injects random traffic to the switches, which only generates a “static” laser energy cost result. However, the laser's energy per bit performance fluctuates due to different process mapping scenarios of applications. In this paper, we did experiments to study the influence of the application's process mapping on the photonic switches' injection traces. Then we built a model to show the connection between the traces and the laser's energy per bit performance. To get the energy fluctuation results quickly and accurately, we propose a heuristic-based energy boundary searching methodology, with the model we built being considered. We also analyze the speedup and convergence of the methodology. Two photonic switches are studied under five kinds of application traces. The study shows an over 60% searching speedup and 90% accuracy in most cases, compared with the enumeration method, and the lasers' energy fluctuations vary from nearly 0% to over 150%. We further analyze the factors inducing such huge fluctuation variations, and a qualitative criterion that predicts the magnitude of the variations is proposed and discussed.","['Photonics', 'Optical switches', 'Laser applications', 'Fluctuations', 'Laser modes', 'Costs', 'Switching systems']","['Application characteristics', 'laser energy flucitation', 'photonic switch', 'computing systems']"
"We use a drift-diffusion model that includes the effect of bleaching to study the impact of nonlinear distortion in a p-i-n photodetector (PD) on RF-modulated frequency combs. This work complements a similar study that we carried out for a modified uni-traveling carrier (MUTC) PD. We begin by using experimental responsivity data to develop an empirical model of the bleaching in a p-i-n PD when operating in pulsed mode. We then incorporate this model of bleaching into a drift-diffusion model. Next, we use this drift-diffusion model to determine the impact of nonlinearity on the second- and third-order intermodulation distortion products IMD2 n and IMD3 n as a function of the comb line number n. We then determine the corresponding output intercept points OIP2 n and OIP3 n and distortion-to-signal ratios ρ 2n and ρ 3n . In contrast to MUTC devices, we find that bleaching increases ρ 2n and ρ 3n at all comb line numbers. However, these distortion products change little as n increases, in contrast to MUTC devices where they grow rapidly as n increases.","['Bleaching', 'Optical pulses', 'Optical attenuators', 'Optical imaging', 'Holography', 'Holographic optical components', 'PIN photodiodes']","['Photodetector', 'nonlinearity', 'frequency combs']"
"In this paper, a physical model is established to reveal the relationship between polarization phase of incident light and in-plane spin splitting (IPSS) of reflected beam, and the impact of polarization phase on the IPSS is systematically investigated. Three interesting features of the effect of polarization phase on IPSS were discovered. Furthermore, it is found that the IPSS can be effectively enhanced and suppressed by adjusting the polarization phase near ±π/2. The enhanced IPSS shift can almost reach its upper limit (that is, half of the beam waist) and the suppressed IPSS shift can be reduced to zero. In addition, it is also found that the spin cumulative direction of spin components can be reversed adjusting the polarization phase at ±π/2.

Additionally, fibers lasing at a longer wavelength may have a lower laser threshold. For ultra-high pump ratio or high fiber temperature, the laser operation state changes from a quasi-four-level to a quasi-three-level scheme, and the laser wavelength may blue-shift.

"Silicon photonics has been studied in various areas by providing small-footprint, high-performance, and mass-producible optoelectronic components integrated on a chip. For the photonic packaging, ultraviolet (UV) curing techniques have been widely utilized. Meanwhile, silica cladding absorption to UV light could alter its refractive index (RI), affecting the optical testing of silicon devices during or after the device packaging. Therefore, it is significant to characterize the dynamics of RI changes induced by UV-light irradiation. However, the in-situ characterization of such devices is seldom explored. Here, we studied the influence of UV-light irradiation on silicon photonic devices by probing resonant wavelength shifts of a racetrack microring resonator. Specifically, we studied the temporary variation of the resonant wavelength and its recovery time under different UV-light exposure durations. Experimental results show that with a UV energy of 21 J/cm 2 , the resonator had a maximum resonant wavelength shift of 0.31 nm, corresponding to an effective RI change of 0.0009 and recovering time of 95 minutes.

"All-dielectric metamaterial structures in the role of the cladding of optical waveguides (WGs) in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are investigated and optimized by means of numerical simulations to increase the integration density of PICs. First the role of the refractive index (material platform) on the effects of metamaterial cladding is studied. The results of a quantitative analysis show that only material platforms with a high refractive index contrast (such as existing Si or membrane InP platform) can noticeably benefit from optimized metamaterial cladding in terms of integration density. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive optimization of the geometry of metamaterial claddings in Si platform to achieve the lowest possible gap width between cores of two adjacent WGs, while keeping the cross-talk bellow the targeted limit of −30 dB at the length of 2 mm. By doing this we can, for the first time, explicitly show how much the integration density of a PIC can be increased. We demonstrate that a metamaterial cladding can, in best case, reduce the gap width by 60% compared to Si WGs with normal cladding in case of 450 nm wide core. The wavelength dependence and sensitivity to fabrication variability are also studied, revealing a trade-off between the lowest possible integration density and usable wavelength range.

The OCT setup is specially designed to create two sampling optics, called dual-side view OCT (DSV-OCT), which allows for imaging IOL from the two opposite sides simultaneously in single OCT volume scanning. This can produce a three-dimensional surface contour without suffering image distortions due to the refraction of the curved surface. Then, the thickness and surface curvature can be easily computed from the surface contours. In addition, DSV-OCT is able to measure the refractive index. Three IOLs with different dioptric powers (5D, 20D and 28D) were chosen to evaluate this method. The results show that this method is capable to provide a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of IOLs from the aspects of thickness, refractive index and dioptric power, and hence can be potentially used as a quality assurance tool by IOL manufacturers.","['Refractive index', 'Thickness measurement', 'Imaging', 'Optical imaging', 'Lenses', 'Optical variables control', 'Optical refraction']","['Optical coherence tomography', 'dual-side view', 'intraocular lens', 'inspection', 'in vitro measurement']"
"Recently an innovative bifocal optical metrology method was proposed for space applications (e.g., rendez-vous and docking), based on unmodulated white LEDs. Here we design, realize, and test a solution that upgrades the metrology to include a digital communication feature, with no modification of the optical elements of the original system: indeed, the scheme exploits the same optical sources that are needed for metrology, which are now also working as optical antennas as their intensity is now modulated. At the receiver side, the conventional camera is now sided by a common photodiode. The system provides unidirectional data communication at 10 kbit/s speed. It is designed to support manoeuvres up to 400 m distance.

"Fiber-optic seismic sensor has become an emerging effective tool for microseismic monitoring, which is of importance for oil and gas production improvement. When processing the fiber-optic data, the recognition of microseismic events is the first crucial step, which is rarely reported due to the lack of such data. In this paper, based on the features of central data distribution, skewness, kurtosis, energy entropy, etc., the classification accuracy of microseismic (MS) events obtained by fiber-optic MS monitoring system and electronic one is compared using machine learning algorithm (e. g. SVM and KNN) for the first time. The results show that fiber-optic data has higher classification accuracy than electronic data when using the feature of central data distribution owing to the high signal-to-noise ratio of fiber-optic data. However, when choosing the features of energy entropy, zero-crossing rate and the energy proportion of specific frequency band, electronic data has higher classification accuracy than fiber-optic data benefiting from the longer events duration and the lower frequency components of electronic data. When using skewness and kurtosis, the classification performance in fiber-optic data is almost consistent with the electronic one. Moreover, the results indicate that the characteristics of MS signal itself have a greater impact on the discrimination ability of MS events than the applied machine learning classification algorithm.","['Optical fiber sensors', 'Monitoring', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Optical fiber networks', 'Entropy', 'Support vector machines', 'Optical fibers']","['Fiber-optic sensor', 'machine learning', 'microsei- smic events recognition']"

"Inverse lithography technologies (ILTs) are critical for improving the imaging performance of lithography in advanced technology nodes. Pixel-based source optimization (SO), as an efficient part of ILTs, can be implemented via heuristic approaches to achieve high-performance lithographic imaging.

The pixelated source can be decoded into the optimized variables of the merit functions in the SO model. The proposed PSO–GA algorithm, as a high-efficiency hybrid algorithm, can transform the discrete SO problem into the optimal search solution for the merit function, thereby inversely enhancing the lithographic-imaging performance.

"Increasing the threshold of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) by frequency and phase modulation is a productive approach to suppress SBS in optical fiber communications. Generally, the modulation frequency is much higher than the Brillouin-gain bandwidth (about 10 MHz). However, the property of the SBS-produced gain is unclear when the frequency of intensity modulation is much lower than the Brillouin-gain bandwidth. Here, we find that the SBS-produced gain increases remarkably near its threshold under the above conditions. It is due to the nonlinearity feature of the SBS. A numerical simulation of the SBS coupled amplitude equations is studied to explain this phenomenon. We demonstrate that the modulation on/off gain produced by this slow intensity modulation is related to the modulation frequency, the waveguide length, and the modulation waveform. According to these new findings, we design a modulation waveform to boost the SBS-produced gain near its threshold by 35 dB in a 1 km length single-mode fiber. The method presented in this paper is expected to apply in SBS studies when the incident optical power is limited.","['Scattering', 'Modulation', 'Gain', 'Frequency modulation', 'Intensity modulation', 'Optical pumping', 'Bandwidth']","['Stimulated brillouin scattering', 'intensity modulation']"

"Spectral radiation could cause color damage to dyed cultural relics, and finding a method to obtain a minimum-damage light source is a key issue to be solved. In this paper, the color change behavior of pigments under exposure was experimentally investigated by irradiating 17 typical inorganic pigments used for dyed cultural relics with 10 different narrow-band LED light sources. Through an analysis of the color difference of the test pigments against the amount of exposure, the responsivity equations of the pigments were obtained and a mathematical model for predicting the color damage degree was proposed. The 10 kinds of narrow-band light were combined to obtain 10 6 LED by using the exhaustive method. The Ra, R 9 , and | Duv | value of the above spectra were calculated. Ra≥90, R 9 ≥0, and | Duv | ≤0.0054 were taken as the evaluation basis, and 35,398 spectra that met color rendering requirements were obtained. The established mathematical model was used to calculate the color damage value to find the minimum-damage spectrum, which was then input into a Thouslite LEDCube system for reduction.

"Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are widely used for weak light detection due to their high gain and high sensitivity. Unfortunately, SPAD devices have random telegraph signal (RTS) noise during the avalanche transition phase, which makes circuit design more difficult. Therefore, the modeling of RTS noise in SPAD devices is of great significance for the design of signal processing circuits. However, RTS noise is not included in the traditional equivalent circuit model. In response to the above problems, this paper implements an equivalent circuit model with RTS noise based on the Cadence. The model is built based on the basic components in the library, and it has strong application universality. The model is validated in a novel embedded photogate SPAD device (EP-SPAD). It accurately simulates the RTS noise and IV characteristics of the EP-SPAD device. In addition, the threshold voltage of EP-SPAD device operating in Geiger mode is precisely defined based on the characteristics of RTS noise.

"We present a monolithically integrated three-section all-active AlGaInAs/InP tunable distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) ridge waveguide laser diode that uses thermal tuning mechanism and mode-hopping tuning principle to achieve wide-range wavelength tuning. It is similar to the traditional three-section DBR laser structure, including a gain section, a phase section, and a DBR grating section. The difference is that the phase section and the DBR section incorporate the same active quantum well structure as the gain section. In this case, weak effective refractive index changes of the three active sections affected by the current injection will occur since the carrier density is clamped by the threshold gain condition of the DBR laser diode. Despite this limitation, a noncontinuous tuning up to ∼30 nm (1564–1594 nm) can be observed using only current injection at a constant temperature of 25 °C. Significant thermal effects occurred during the tuning process. In addition, a discontinuity is introduced in the tuning because it does not contain a passive region for phase adjustment. However, the device still provides a stable single longitudinal mode output with nine channels, a wavelength spacing of about 4 nm, and a side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of more than 30 dB.

"Multi-wavelength polarizers have many essential applications in optics, quantum communication, Q switch and relating research fields. However, polarizing waveband of the traditional polarizer is restricted in the structure of fibers, which results in finite polarizing wavelengths. In this work, a novel D-shaped microstructure fiber polarizer (DMFP) with metal grating was proposed. Utilizing the abundant harmonic vector characteristics on the surface of metal grating, the DMFP can realize the function of multi-band polarization filtering. Numerical results show that it can achieve three bands of polarization filtering in x-polarized mode from 350 nm to 1600 nm and the resonance wavelengths are periodically modulated by grating. In the meanwhile, by optimizing grating parameters, the number of bands of polarization filtering can be further increased, thus, it fulfills the effective adjustment of polarization filtering. It is promising that metal grating based DMFP has great potential values in the fields of optical filter, communication, and functional devices, etc.","['Metals', 'Gratings', 'Couplings', 'Filtering', 'Optical fiber filters', 'Fiber gratings', 'Optical fiber polarization']","['Microstructure optical fiber', 'multi-band polarizing filter', 'metal grating']"

"The burst-mode continuous phase frequency shift-keying (CPFSK) transmitter that combines a directly modulated laser diode, an electro absorption modulator and a semiconductor optical amplifier is attractive as a cost-effective transmitter for phase modulation formats for digital signal processing (DSP)-based coherent passive optical network (PON) upstream signaling. However, since highly accurate wavelength controllers for the transmitters in optical network units (ONUs) create excessive cost burdens, large carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) must be expected. Thus, a CFO compensation method with wide compensation range is required. This paper proposes a novel CFO estimation and compensation method for burst-mode CPFSK signals in upstream PON signaling. The proposed method is based on a simple blind algorithm and does not require any training symbols. We demonstrate wide CFO compensation range, from −12 to 14 GHz, with high receiver sensitivity, less than −42.5 dBm for 10 Gbit/s binary CPFSK signals. This range far exceeds that of the conventional CFO compensation method using a blind algorithm. Moreover, the proposed method can enhance the convergence of finite impulse response (FIR) filters. The feasibility of the proposed CFO compensation technique is successfully demonstrated for burst-mode CPFSK signals.","['Passive optical networks', 'Optical network units', 'Optical receivers', 'Optical transmitters', 'Optical filters', 'Optical fiber sensors', 'Optical amplifiers']","['Passive optical network (PON)', 'time division multiplexing (TDM)', 'continuous phase frequency shift-keying (CPFSK)', 'burst-mode coherent receiver (BMCR)', 'carrier fre-quency offset (CFO)']"
"The Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) is widely used in high-speed optical communication, and the stability of its bias point is the key to maintain the performance of the communication system. Numerous automatic bias control methods have been proposed to stabilize the bias point, which can be classified into power-based and dither-based methods. The power-based method features low-complexity and is considered of low-precision, thus it is usually applied to low-order modulation. In contrast, ditherbased method features high-complexity and is considered of highprecision, therefore it is usually applied to high-order modulation. This paper explores the bias impact mechanism and analyzes the impact of the bias and dither signal. Traditional view is that the performance of dither-based outperforms power-based ones. However, the impact of dither is ignored. Here we compare the performance of the power-based and dither-based method under fair conditions. The results show that the power-based method has higher SNR and better performance taking into account the impact of dither, which indicates that practically it is more suitable for high-order modulation","['Modulation', 'Optical filters', 'Harmonic analysis', 'Feedback control', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Optical feedback', 'Nonlinear optics']","['Bias control', 'MZM', 'coherent communication']"

"On-chip high extinction ratio Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) have always attracted interest from researchers as it can be used in many applications including astrophotonics, optical switching, programmable photonic circuit, and quantum information. However, in previous research studies, ultra-high extinction ratio on-chip MZIs have only been achieved by using a multi-stage MZI approach. In this paper, we investigate a high extinction ratio single-stage MZI based on two cascaded multimode interferometers (MMI). We determine that TM noise is an important factor that can prevent us from achieving high extinction ratio MZI. By introducing a bend-based TM filter without additional loss, we experimentally demonstrate that such a TM filter can improve the maximum extinction ratio of the MMI-MZI by more than 10 dB. With the TM filter, we report a record high 61.2 dB extinction ratio on a single stage, thermally tunable MMI-MZI with only 1.5 dB insertion loss and more than 60 nm bandwidth.

"Optical vortices (OVs) have received much attention in recent years and are widely explored in communication applications. The on-chip vortex emitter/modulator is preferred when it comes to photonic integration and chip-scale communication.

Here, we propose a metasurface OV emitter based on wave vector synthesis for vortex generation and modulation. A thorough theoretical analysis of the OV generation by two approximate methods was carried out, which suggests the superiority of Wave Vector method over Phase method. Afterwards, the wave vector manipulation implemented by Phase gradient metasurfaces was studied for controlling the topological charges of generated OVs. Finite element method simulations showed that, in the topological charge range of −6 to 6 and the wavelength range of 1.45 μm to 1.55 μm, the effective vortex emission efficiency of the proposed emitter is around 45%.

"On-chip arbitrary-elliptical-polarization converter plays a key role in optical information processing.

"The compression of the ciphertext of a cryptosystem is desirable considering the dramatic increase in secure data transfer via Internet. In this paper, we propose a simple and universal scheme to compress and decompress the ciphertext of an optical cryptosystem by the aid of deep learning (DL). For compression, the ciphertext is first resized to a relatively small dimension by bilinear interpolation and thereafter condensed by the JPEG2000 standard. For decompression, a well-trained deep neural network (DNN) can be employed to perfectly recover the original ciphertext, in spite of the severe information loss suffered by the compressed file. In contrast with JPEG2000 and JPEG, our proposal can achieve a far smaller size of the compressed file (SCF) while offering comparable decompression quality. In addition, the SCF can be further reduced by compromising the quality of the recovered plaintext. It is also shown that the compression procedure can provide an additional security level, and this may offer new insight into the compressive encryption in optical cryptosystems.

"Compact and low-loss waveguide devices are highly desired in the development of THz-wave circuits. Nonradiative dielectric (NRD) waveguides having simple structures and very low loss are promising platforms for THz-wave circuits, and previously some basic devices have been reported. As the NRD guide has a non-radiative nature, the NRD grating bandpass filters that have been reported for millimeter-wave circuits are more suitable to design in THz-wave range. In this paper, we present THz NRD grating bandpass filters and develop an efficient optimal design method to realize these devices based on genetic algorithm (GA) and effective index method (EIM). The optimized device achieved the desired flat top transmission band within the aimed frequency range with only 0.46 dB of avg.

"Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems have been widely implemented in guided and non-guided communications. Even though they are becoming a standard for popular technologies such as WiFi, their implementation in newly emerging ones is still in evolution. As the number of connected devices increases, the radio frequency (RF) channel gets crowded. Here is where visible light communication (VLC) links gain interest. VLC offers a wireless alternative to RF with a trade-off between the necessity of line of sight with the offer of a free, highly secure, and immune to electromagnetic interference communication channel. This paper proposes a programmable software implementation of an OFDM system using a novel phase correction technique for VLC channels. The new equation considers two types of phase shifts, one that will be non-deterministic (has a random variation) and another that will be deterministic and, therefore, can be estimated and corrected. This second can be split into two: one that comes from the clock differences and has more impact on higher subcarriers, and the second that appears from the electronics of the link and will directly impact the symbols' phase. The main difference with current phase correction techniques is the identification and estimation of the deterministic noise specific to VLC systems. The deterministic noise impact all subcarriers equally and must be subtracted before the measure of the shift induced by the differences between the transmitter and receiver clocks. Another difference is that the analysis and tests have been done with data collected in an actual hardware implementation.","['OFDM', 'Symbols', 'Visible light communication', 'Optical modulation', 'Hardware', 'Adaptive optics', 'Optical transmitters']","['Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)', 'frequency correction', 'visible light communication (VLC)', 'phase shift']"

Optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) is an alternative of RF oscillator that allows overcoming the phase noise limitation of electrical oscillator. Here, we propose a novel photonic RF synthesizer by using a voltage-controlled optically tunable OEO as VCO in a PLL. By phase-locking OEO to a tunable RF reference, tunable RF carrier with precise frequency can be synthesized. The OEO incorporates a RF photonic filter as the mode selector harnessing the light-sound interaction in a fiber, namely the stimulated Brillouin scattering. Due to the low dissipation rate of the confined acoustic wave, a narrowband anti-Stokes loss spectrum is formed, which can be transformed into a high quality factor tunable RF bandpass filter with the aid of a phase modulated optical probe wave. It facilitates the removal of the supermodes and enables the frequency tuning of OEO. Experimentally, we attain a RF synthesizer with frequency synthesis tuning range from 6 GHz to 12 GHz. The minimum tuning step is 8 Hz. At 8.4 GHz, the phase noise is −125 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset. The phase-locking dynamics, frequency tunability, and phase noise are thoroughly investigated. Our approach offers the prospects of low phase noise RF synthesis with wide frequency range.","['Frequency synthesizers', 'Radio frequency', 'Phase locked loops', 'Tuning', 'Frequency conversion', 'Phase noise', 'Photonics']","['Photonic RF synthesizer', 'phase-locking', 'optoelectronic oscillator', 'stimulated Brillouin scattering']"
"Two structures that can realise optical single sideband modulation without generating both second order upper and lower sidebands are presented. They are based on a dual-parallel Mach Zehnder modulator (DP-MZM) with an optical filter and a dual-polarisation dual-parallel Mach Zehnder modulator (DPol-DPMZM) with a 90° hybrid coupler. The former is an all-optical structure and hence it has a very wide bandwidth. The latter uses one DP-MZM to realise single sideband suppressed carrier modulation while the other DP-MZM simply passes the optical carrier. It also suppresses the third order sideband on the same side as the wanted fundamental RF modulation sideband. Hence, in an ideal situation, there is no second order harmonic component generated after photodetection. Experimental results are presented for the novel structures, which demonstrate the realisation of optical single sideband modulation without second order sidebands. The results also show large fundamental to second order harmonic power ratio over a wide input RF signal frequency range even after inserting a long single mode fibre into the system for signal transmission. The new optical single sideband modulators find applications in improving the multioctave spurious free dynamic range in a long-haul fibre optic link and reducing measurement errors in an optical vector analyser.","['Radio frequency', 'Amplitude modulation', 'Optical fibers', 'Modulation', 'Fiber optics', 'Optical modulation', 'Optical filters']","['Optical single-sideband modulation', 'electro-optic modulators', 'radio over fibre (RoF)', 'optical vector network analyser']"

"A photonic wheel describes a special structure in which the electric vector spins (with time) in a plane containing the propagation direction, while around a C-point (a point with circular polarization) the polarization Möbius strip can be formed topologically in three-dimensional (3D) space. These two interesting but very different structures are both unique to 3D structured fields, and in this article they are studied together and also their connections are analyzed. By highly confining the trigonometric beams, the three-dimensional (3D) fields with a wide area of photonic wheels are constructed, and the characteristics of the photonic wheels in different regions are analyzed. The expression for the C-lines of the photonic wheels is derived, which provides a simple way to get the exact position of the C-lines and also is a basis for observing polarization Möbius strips. Along a C-line, the behaviors of the polarization Möbius strips, including two typical (generic) Möbius strips with opposite indices, and two special topological events seemingly violating the topological law are examined. Our results show that the trick and the paradox in the two special events actually are the manifestations of the trace-dependent property and the observer-dependent property of the polarization Möbius strips respectively. The finding also suggests that even in a short segment of a C-line rich topological events related to polarization Möbius strips can be observed. Our research provides a way to observe the photonic wheels, the polarization Möbius strips and their connection, also supplies a theoretical foundation for special structures in 3D fields.","['Wheels', 'Three-dimensional displays', 'Photonics', 'Strips', 'Optical beams', 'Stokes parameters', 'Polarization']","['Photonic wheel', 'spin density vector', 'polarization Möbius strip', 'spin angular momentum', 'orbital angular momentum']"
"A novel photonic scheme based on parallel dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator (DDMZM) to generate flexible and switchable multi-band linearly frequency modulated (LFM) microwave waveforms is proposed. In the scheme, a radio frequency (RF) local oscillator is applied to one arm of DDMZM1 and DDMZM2 with a relative phase of 90°, respectively; while a single-chirp signal to the other arms of the two DDMZMs with a tunable relative phase shift. The generated two independently lightwaves are detected by a balanced photodetector (BPD) and the switchable multi-band LFM signals are generated flexibly. By appropriately adjusting the phase difference θ , dual-band complementary LFM signals and multi-band LFM signals can be easily switched. Based on simulations, the dual-band complementary LFM waveforms centered at 10 GHz and 30 GHz are generated with a doubled bandwidth (3.2 GHz) as θ = 0, the multi-band LFM microwave waveforms with center frequency-bandwidth of 10 GHz-1.6 GHz, 20 GHz-6.4 GHz and 30 GHz-1.6 GHz, covering X, K and Ka bands, are simultaneously obtained with flatness of 1.9 dB as θ = π/2 or 3π/2.

"The quantization technique with a low-bit resolution can significantly reduce the cost and power consumption of analog-to-digital converter (ADC). It will play an important role in energy conservation and cost reduction for the incoming B5G millimeter-wave (MMW) communication systems. In this paper, we propose and demonstrated experimentally a low-bit Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based non-uniform adaptive vector quantization (AVQ) scheme for the low-cost intensity modulated envelope detection photonics-assisted 28 GHz MMW communication system for the first time. The principles of GMM-based one-dimensional adaptive scalar quantization (ASQ) and multi-dimensional AVQ are first introduced, and then are used to realize the low-bit non-uniform adaptive quantization for reducing the ADC bit resolution of MMW receiver. Furthermore, the performance of traditional uniform quantization, the present K -means and proposed GMM-based non-uniform ASQ/AVQ schemes are evaluated and compared in detail. Utilizing the proposed GMM-based AVQ scheme, the ADC quantization resolution in our MMW receiver can be reduced from 5 bits of the traditional uniform quantization to as low as 2 bits, without noticeable performance penalty. Moreover, as compared with the K -means-based quantization scheme, the MMW receiver enabled by GMM-based ASQ/AVQ scheme can save about half of the quantization time under similar performance. This is mainly because the clustering based on probability converges faster than the Euclidean distance, which significantly reduces the number of iterations required. Therefore, the GMM-based AVQ scheme is a promising solution to realize high performance ADCs with low-bit resolution for future MMW-enabled optical fiber wireless access networks.","['Adaptive systems', 'Vector quantization', 'Predictive models', 'Costs', 'Adaptation models', 'Estimation', 'Photonics']","['Vector quantization', 'Gaussian mixture model', 'K-means clustering', 'low bit', 'MMW', 'optical fiber wireless access']"

"In this paper, the physical layer security (PLS) analysis for a decode-and-forward (DF) protocol based multi-hop hybrid radio frequency (RF)/ free space optics (FSO) is presented. Herein, two different scenarios are considered for detecting the secured information at the destination. In the first scenario, at each hop, the received signals with higher secrecy capacity are selected. However, in the second scenario, the RF and FSO signals are simply decoded and forwarded to the next hop and selection is done at the last hop only. Each node in the system is connected to its subsequent node through parallel RF and FSO links. The FSO links and RF links are characterized by Málaga ( \mathcal {M} ) and Nakagami- m composite distributions respectively. For both scenarios, the secrecy outage probability (SOP), strictly positive secrecy capacity (SPSC), intercept probability (IP), and effective secrecy throughput (EST) are obtained as performance metrics. These performance metrics are obtained by considering pointing error, different optical signal detection methods, turbulence effect, and the RF link fading parameter ( m ). Using the results, the security and reliability trade-off analysis is discussed for two scenarios. In addition, the asymptotic results are also obtained to study the system in depth. Further, the secrecy diversity order (SDO) and secrecy coding gain (SCG) are obtained to analyse the system in depth. Finally, Monte-Carlo Simulation is performed to verify the obtained results. The results manifest that the scenario with selection at each hop provides better secrecy performance than the scenario with selection at the last hop.",[],[]
"The risk of information leakage increases when the relay technology is introduced to extend the communication range and improve the quality of communication services of cell-edge users in visible light communication (VLC) systems. To evaluate these security risks, physical layer security (PLS) performance for decode-and-forward (DF) relay-aided VLC system is investigated in this paper. Specifically, the theoretical expressions of the upper and lower bounds of the security outage probability (SOP) for the DF relay-aided VLC system under the amplitude constraint are obtained based on a stochastic geometry analysis method. Monte Carlo simulation validates the correctness of the derived theoretical expressions of the upper and lower bounds of the SOP. Moreover, simulation results show that the security outage performance of the DF relay-aided VLC system is deteriorated compared with the non-relay VLC system. Furthermore, the influences of the eavesdroppers' distribution density, the radiation radius of LED source, the radiation radius and deployment height of the relay on the SOP have been investigated. Last but not least, the optimal deployment height of the relay can be determined for achieving the optimum security outage performance. These parameters can effectively guide the design of the secure relay-aided VLC system.","['Visible light communication', 'Relays', 'Security', 'Light emitting diodes', 'Probability', 'Power system reliability', 'Geometry']","['Decode-and-forward', 'physical layer security', 'relay', 'security outage probability', 'visible light communication']"
"Visible light communications (VLC) is a good candidate technology for the 6th generation (6G) wireless communications. Red, green, and blue (RGB) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based VLC has become an important research branch due to its low price and high reliability. However, the saturation of photodiode (PD) caused by the ambient background light may seriously degrade the bit error rate (BER) performance of an RGB-VLC system's three spatially uncoupled information streams (i.e., red, green, and blue LEDs can transmit different data packets simultaneously) in practical applications. To mitigate the ambient light interference in point-to-point RGB-VLC systems, we propose, PNC-VLC, a network-coded scheme that uses two LEDs with the same color at the transmitter to transmit two different data streams and we make use of the naturally overlapped signals at the receiver to formulate physical-layer network coding (PNC). The adaptivity of PNC-VLC could effectively improve the BER degradation problem caused by the saturation of PD under the influence of ambient light. We conducted simulations based on the parameters of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products to prove the superiority of the PNC-VLC under the influence of four typical illuminants. Simulation results show that the PNC-VLC system can maintain a better and more stable system BER performance under different ambient background light conditions. Remarkably, with 2/3 throughput efficiency, PNC-VLC can bring 133.3% gain to the BER performance when compared with RGB-VLC under the Illuminant A interference model, making it a good option for VLC applications with unpredictable ambient background interferences.","['Light emitting diodes', 'Optical transmitters', 'Visible light communication', 'Optical saturation', 'Optical receivers', 'Optical filters', 'Image color analysis']","['Visible light communications', 'physical-layer network coding', 'ambient light noise', 'photodiode saturation']"

"High-precision pointing is a key technology in free-space optical communication, as it improves the acquisition probability and reduces the acquisition time. High-precision pointing of an optical communication terminal (OCT) on a motion platform is particularly important for establishing a global communication network. An OCT on a motion platform is subjected to both linear and nonlinear pointing errors. The present paper analyzes both types of pointing errors in detail. Linear pointing errors can be well corrected by the parameter model. This paper proposes a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm that corrects nonlinear pointing errors and verifies its effectiveness through tracking star experiments. After correcting the nonlinear pointing errors through KNN algorithm, the modified and actual open-loop pointing errors were 69.0 and 70.8 μrad, respectively, reduced from 87.3 and 91.9 μrad, respectively, in the parameter model.

"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a well established imaging modality for high-resolution three-dimensional imaging in clinical settings. While imaging, care must be taken to minimize the imaging artifacts related to the polarization differences between the sample and the reference signals. Current OCT systems adopt complicated mechanisms, such as the use of multiple detectors, polarization-maintaining fibers, polarization controllers to achieve polarization artifacts free sample images. Often the polarization controllers need readjustment which is not suitable for clinical settings. In this work, we demonstrate a simple approach that can minimize the polarization-related artifacts in the OCT systems. Polarization artifact-free images are acquired using two orthogonally polarized reference signals where the orthogonal polarization is achieved using a Faraday mirror. In the current approach, only a single detector is required which makes the current approach compatible with swept-source or camera-based OCT systems. Furthermore, no polarization controllers are used in the system which increases the system stability while minimizing the artifacts related to the sample birefringence, polarization change due to the sample scattering, and polarization change due to the optical fiber movements present in the system.","['Mirrors', 'Imaging', 'Optical imaging', 'Gold', 'Optical polarization', 'Optical reflection', 'Nails']","['Optical coherence tomography', 'biomedical optical imaging', 'polarization artifacts', 'birefringence']"

"All-dielectric metasurfaces, which are periodic 2D gratings on slab waveguides, are designed to obtain angular-dependent polarization-insensitive guided-mode resonance filters operating in the terahertz region.

When the grating periods along the y -axis are adjusted to the above values, such polarization-independent resonances show good robustness, which means the polarization-independent resonance frequency of the split bands is mainly determined by the grating periods along the x -axis and is in an inverse proportion. Meanwhile, there are additional polarization-independent resonances formed by the intersection of the split and degenerate bands for the two unequal grating periods.

"Intensity-modulation direct-detection (IM/DD) probabilistically shaped (PS) 8-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) signal is promising for high-speed intra-data-center networks. However, the challenges of a PS-PAM-8 transmission system are complicated distribution matcher (DM) and nonlinear equalizer. In this work, we propose a simple PS-PAM-8 transmission system, where the probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) encoder consists of an energy-level-assigned (ELA)-based DM and a low-density parity-check (LDPC) encoder. In the ELA-based DM, a simple lookup table is designed to realize an approximate bilateral Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution by assigning energy levels to various symbols.

In addition, a simplified Volterra equalizer (SVE) is introduced to eliminate the inter-symbol interference and improve the receiver sensitivity of PS-PAM-8 signal, where the SVE only includes the 2-order kernel to reduce its complexity. We experimentally demonstrated the proposed PS-PAM-8 scheme and verified its outperformance over uniform PAM-8 signal in the back-to-back and 2-km standard single mode fiber (SSMF) transmission.

"We consider a normal dispersive fiber with a dominant dark soliton playing the role of a background pump, we introduce a weak moving pulse (signal) and numerically show that for small enough velocities, this pulse can be trapped into the dip of the potential well formed by the strong dark soliton (pump) and undergoes harmonic oscillations.

"This paper investigates pulse-profile-maintaining characteristics of a gain-switched nanosecond Raman fiber laser (RFL) and its Raman fiber amplifier (RFA). It is found that the pulse profiles can be precisely maintained after the gain-switched Raman conversion, only if the pump pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is an integer multiple of, a unit fraction of, or multiple unit fractions of the fundamental cavity-defined PRF. The produced Raman pulses are then amplified in an RFA, and the pulse profiles can also be precisely maintained. However, it is further noticed that the detuning-induced defects can be amplified if they are with the pulse itself. All these observed phenomena should originate from the transient property of Raman gain, not involving any notable delaying or saturation effects that are typically seen with rare-earth-doped gain fibers. Our results demonstrate that, in the nanosecond scale, the Raman-converted pulse can well maintain its profile and shows strong resistance to detune between PRFs of the pump and Raman pulses. Benefiting from that, we can reasonably neglect the pump depletion effect due to walk-off effect typically seen in various short pulse regimes, which can largely simplify the design of nanosecond pulsed pumping Raman sources.","['Optical fiber amplifiers', 'Stimulated emission', 'Pump lasers', 'Optical resonators', 'Optical pumping', 'Erbium-doped fiber lasers', 'Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers']","['Fiber lasers', 'laser amplifiers', 'stimulated Raman scattering']"

"A double Sagnac interferometer (DSI) and vernier effect sensor for relative humidity (RH) is proposed and experimentally implemented, in which two single Sagnac interferometers (SI1 and SI2) cascaded in parallel to construct the structure of the sensor.

The experimental results show that in the range of 30∼80%RH, the RH sensitivities of the spectral envelope can reach −0.48 nm/%RH, which is 60 times higher than that measured by the single Sagnac interferometer sensor (8 pm/%RH).

"Cross-eye jamming technology has been used in electronic warfare, which attempts to protect a military platform from monopulse tracking radars. The cross-eye jamming technology has the ability of inducing angular errors to the monopulse tracking radars by transmitting two jamming signals with equal amplitudes and opposite phases. At present, high operation frequency and broadband cross-eye jamming system has been rarely demonstrated. Therefore, the present cross-eye jamming systems are hard to jam frequency-agile radar or multi-band radar, whose carrier frequency covers a large spectral range. In this paper, a photonic-assisted broadband radio frequency (RF) cross-eye jamming system is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. To achieve effective jamming effect, the intercepted radar signal is modulated to optical carriers and the phase shift is realized by optical spectrum processing. The relationship between system parameter tolerances and jamming effects are also simulated. Furthermore, the RF transfer function of X-band, Ku-band and K-band has been obtained in the experiments.

"Currently, the engineering of miniature spectrometers mainly faces three problems: the mismatch between the number of filters at the front end of the detector and the spectral reconstruction accuracy; the lack of a stable spectral reconstruction algorithm; and the lack of a spectral reconstruction evaluation method suitable for engineering. Therefore, based on 20 sets of filters, this paper classifies and optimizes the filter array by the K-means algorithm and particle swarm algorithm, and obtains the optimal filter combination under different matrix dimensions. Then, the truncated singular value decomposition-convex optimization algorithm is used for high-precision spectral reconstruction.In terms of spectral evaluation, due to the strong randomness of the target detected during the working process of the spectrometer, the standard value of the target spectrum cannot be obtained. Therefore, we adopt the method of joint cross-validation of multiple sets of data for spectral evaluation. The results show that when the random error of +/− 2 code values is applied multiple times for reconstruction, the spectral angle cosine value between the reconstructed curves becomes more than 0.995, which proves that the spectral reconstruction under this algorithm has high stability. At the same time, the spectral angle cosine value of the spectral reconstruction curve and the standard curve can reach above 0.99, meaning that it realizes a high-precision spectral reconstruction effect. A high-precision spectral reconstruction algorithm based on truncated singular value-convex optimization, is established in this paper, providing important scientific research value for the engineering application of micro-spectrometers.","['Filtering algorithms', 'Information filters', 'Detectors', 'Optimization', 'Optical filters', 'Reconstruction algorithms', 'Standards']",['Spectral reconstruction spectral analysis convex optimization cross-validation']

"In this paper, a self-adaptive resource-allocation scheme combining traffic prediction with user satisfaction is firstly established in multi-wavelength VPON. Among VPONs, by proposing a (wavelength utility)-based dynamic wavelength allocation algorithm, the optimal allocation of wavelengths can be achieved. In a VPON: under condition that the total requested bandwidth is larger than the total bandwidth, by introducing a bandwidth constraint factor ϵ , the maximum amount of bandwidth granted for high-priority service can be limited, and the “starvation” problem of low-priority service can be prevented. By solving the user satisfaction model, not only the optimal allocation of low-priority service can be obtained, but also the comprehensive user satisfaction is maximized. Under condition that the total requested bandwidth is smaller than the total bandwidth, by combining an ANN prediction model with a user satisfaction model, a bandwidth allocation model based on traffic prediction and user satisfaction is created. By this model, not only the resource utilization is improved but also the transmission delay is reduced. At the same time, user satisfaction is maximized. By adjudicating on the set judgment condition, the self-adaptive function of control system for the above two conditions is implemented.

We reveal that it is possible to produce optical whispering gallery modes resonators in low-temperature heating mode and create a triangular-shape microresonator solely with the negative variations. The negative variations may also occur in peripheral areas of high-temperature heated fiber while introducing positive effective radius variations.

"Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis is a crucial component of optical system development for space remote sensing instruments. It serves as a quantitative assessment of the imaging quality and radiometric characteristics of space remote sensing. This paper utilizes the working principles and energy transfer principles of space remote sensing instruments to conduct SNR analysis and model development for commonly used spaceborne imagers, spaceborne imaging spectrometers, micro-optical remote sensing instruments, and point-source spatial targets. Additionally, the paper also examines the impact of the presence and width of slits in different space environments on the SNR of space remote sensing instruments. The calculation results indicate that the analysis of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for different space remote sensing instruments requires the establishment of distinct SNR models. The magnitude of SNR primarily depends on crucial factors such as optical system quality, detector performance, and the space environment. Therefore, in the instrument design and data processing processes, it is essential to consider how to maximize SNR and establish more accurate corresponding SNR models to provide high-quality remote sensing data.","['Instruments', 'Remote sensing', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Aerospace electronics', 'Detectors', 'Pupils', 'Optical surface waves']","['Signal-to-noise ratio', 'space remote sensing', 'energy transfer', 'detector']"
"We propose a novel design to enhance third harmonic generation (THG) using individual Au nanorods (NRs) coated with gain materials. The present design avoids the use of conventional gap systems, where complicated semiconductor techniques must be used in order to realize the corresponding high-resolution planar structures. As such, this design can contribute to a significant THG enhancement from nanoparticles; this THG is especially favorable for many applications (e.g, photovoltaic devices, bioimaging, and therapy). We perform numerical simulations using a finite-difference time domain (FDTD) in order to identify the origin of the enhanced nonlinear response based on the present system. In addition, we present an effective method to characterize the third harmonics by using Fourier analysis separating them from the excited light. The results show that the THG enhancement of the gain-assisted Au NR with a critical gain coefficient is one to two orders of magnitude greater than the highest values reported for gap THG systems.","['Gold', 'Harmonic analysis', 'Electric fields', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Optical harmonic generation', 'Silicon compounds', 'Scattering']","['third harmonic generation', 'Au nanorods', 'gain materials']"

"New microwave photonic signal processing structures for generating in-phase and quadrature phase RF signals are presented. They are based on designing the bias angles of a dual-drive Mach Zehnder modulator (DDMZM) or a dual-parallel Mach Zehnder modulator (DPMZM) to introduce a specific phase shift to the optical carrier and using a wavelength division multiplexer to separate the lower and upper RF modulation sidebands. The optical carrier beat with the sidebands in a pair of photodetectors generate two output RF signals with a quadrature phase difference. The two proposed structures are simple, low cost and free of electrical components. The upper operating frequency of the two microwave photonic signal processors is only limited by the optical modulator bandwidth.

"We propose and demonstrate a new simultaneous optical and radio frequency (RF) transmission scheme using optical phase stabilization combined with phase conjugate technology. The acousto-optical modulator (AOM) is used as a frequency actuator to compensate the optical frequency phase noise introduced by the optical fiber link, and the electro-optical modulator (EOM) is used to modulate two optical carrier sidebands simultaneously to stabilize the RF phase by phase conjugate technology. The novelty is that forward and backward RFs are distinguished by the AOMs used in standard optical carrier transfer to avoid the backscattering without WDM, so that the optical link is more symmetric, reducing the degradation of frequency stability due to polarization fluctuation and chromatic dispersion thermal sensitivity. We experimentally demonstrate 193.4 THz optical frequency transfer with a frequency stability of 1.2 \times 10 −17 at the integral time of 1 s and 3.3 \times 10 −19 at 10000 s, 1 GHz RF with a frequency stability of 7 \times 10 −13 at 1 s and 3 \times 10 −16 at 10000 s over a 50.4 km fiber spools.

Here, we demonstrate that two raised cosine pulses with the same center wavelengths of 2.0 μm are firstly coalesced into a single combined pulse and then realize nearly self-similar compression in the dispersion exponentially decreasing silicon waveguide, where the final compressed pulse was reduced from 200 fs to 49 fs with a compression factor of 4.08. Additionally, the peak power of the compressed pulse steadily rises to 2.16 times of the initial peak power. For further development, we also illustrate two input pulses with different center wavelengths to realize effective combination and self-similar compression.

"Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) imaging is a promising technique for reducing radiation dose and accelerating data acquisition in medical imaging. However, the challenges of handling a reduced number of projection views persist for both iterative estimation and deep neural reconstruction methods. In this paper, to address these challenges, we present a singular value decomposition-based adaptive sampling approximate message passing network (ASAMP-Net) sparse-view CT imaging method. To achieve multiple sparse views projection within a single scene imaging and alleviate the computational burden, our proposed ASAMP-Net method incorporates an adaptive sampling module into the AMP deep unrolling network. This module dynamically adjusts the data samples used during the learning process, making our method highly adaptable to various projection matrices. Moreover, by decomposing the projection matrix into its principal components, our approach identifies the respective contributions of independent structures. We then select the most significant principal components to construct a projection matrix model with increased orthogonality, thereby enhancing reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Notably, ASAMP-Net handles various sparse projection views with just a single training process, achieving prominent imaging results compared to other methods in the literature.","['Image reconstruction', 'Computed tomography', 'Training', 'Matrix decomposition', 'Imaging', 'Iterative methods', 'Signal processing algorithms']","['Adaptive sampling', 'Deep unfolding', 'ASAMPNet', 'Sparse-view CT', 'Image reconstruction']"

"A technique called weak-lock (WL) has been proposed and applied to a simple optical on/off switch to increase its working speed from 1 to 12 Gb/s with clear output waveforms, whereas the required injection power is decreased. The switch is based on the injection-locking property of a single-mode Fabry-Pérot laser diode (SMFP-LD). Unlike the case of full-lock (FL) in which self-locked mode and all side modes of the SMFP-LD are fully suppressed due to high injected input power, in the WL case, the injection power is gradually decreased as if the SMFP-LD's self-locked mode is still maintained. It was observed that the output waveform's rising edge, taken at the self-locked mode's wavelength after the filter, in the WL case is clean at speed of 12 Gb/s compared to the blur and noisy rising edge in the FL case even at much lower speed (1 Gb/s). In summary, the WL technique shows advantages compared to the conventional FL technique in terms of lower injection power and higher on/off switching speed.","['Optical switches', 'Optical wavelength conversion', 'Logic gates', 'Laser beams', 'Measurement by laser beam', 'High-speed optical techniques']","['Weak-lock', 'full-lock', 'single-mode FP-LD', 'optical on/off switch']"

"Electro-optic modulation with a constant modulation depth plays important roles in quantum metrology, microwave photonics, and optical precision measurement and sensing, etc. To compensate the continuous drift of the half-wave voltage and maintain the modulation depth, we incidentally generated a reference laser to make intermedia optical beatings with the carrier and +1st sideband, and tightly locked the carrier to sideband ratio by extracting the relative microwave power of those intermedia beat signals using a home-made electronic control module. Experiments of the short-term test for locking bandwidth, the anti-jamming capability, and the long-term stability were demonstrated. As is verified that, the locking bandwidth was estimated up to tens of kHz, and the anti-jamming capability was confirmed despite of a strong hair-dryer agitation. The long-term stability for the modulation depth stabilization showed that the peak-to-peak relative stability for 150-minute was 5.67 × 10 −6 , and the Allan deviation reached a minimum of 2.19 × 10 −7 at an averaging time of 400 s, which is improved by more than four orders of magnitude compared with the open-loop regime.

"We propose and demonstrate a photonic microwave signal harmonic down-converter with image rejection capability via stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). A dual-polarization dual-parallel Mach–Zehnder modulator (DP-DPMZM) is driven by a radio frequency/image (RF/IM) signal and a local oscillation (LO) signal to realize equivalent phase modulation and 4th-order double sideband modulation respectively. The optical carriers from the two arms of the DP-DPMZM can cancel out each other after polarization combining, thereby increasing the useful optical signal power in photodetection. Since the beating notes between the IM-modulated signals and LO-modulated 4th-order sidebands interfere destructively, the down-converted IM signals disappear naturally, which makes the down-converted image parts be suppressed in optical domain. By using an SBS-based dual-band microwave photonic filter to suppress the RF modulated -1st-order sideband and amplify the +1st-order sideband, destructive interference can be broken. Therefore, the RF signal over frequency range of 21-28 GHz can be down-converted to intermediate frequency (IF) band, and the image rejection ratio (IRR) can be also improved to more than 55 dB.

"The extended reality (XR) display, including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), requires ultrahigh-resolution and high-luminance pixel technology. GaN-based micro-LEDs are the most promising for high-density pixel applications. However, it is necessary to simultaneously fabricate full-color R/G/B emitters on a single substrate. Moreover, the efficiency droop at long wavelengths with high-indium InGaN still remains a challenge.

"Adaptive optics (AO) can effectively improve the beam quality of solid-state slab lasers. However, the aperture of the output beam increases as the output power of the laser increases, resulting in a larger measurement system. Ultimately, a more complex AO system needs to be designed. To meet the requirements of conjugate imaging in an AO system, it is of research significance to coordinate and optimize the system's structural dimensional parameters while enabling the detection of multiple parameters, such as the wave-front and beam quality. In this paper, a multiparameter measurement technique in a large-aperture rectangular laser beam aberration-correction system is proposed. The system layout is optimized with total dimensions of 400 mm × 150 mm × 246 mm (L × W × H). The AO system conforms to the requirements for conjugate detection and can perform wave-front detection, far-field evaluation, and near-field detection of a 160 mm × 120 mm rectangular beam produced from a solid-state slab laser.

"Optical networks-on-chips (ONoCs) are the key technology for the sustainable development of multiprocessors system-on-chip (MPSoC) in the future. Micro-ring resonators (MRs) are widely used in ONoCs as key device to select and redirect optical signals. However, MRs have the inherent property of being sensitive to environmental temperature. With the fluctuation of environmental temperature, its resonance wavelength drifts, which can introduce more loss and crosstalk noise to ONoCs and make the network performance decline sharply. Therefore, it is very important to analyze the influence of thermal effect in ONoCs to solve this problem. In this paper, the theoretical models of loss and crosstalk noise changing with temperature are established from device level to network level, respectively. And a series of network performances of mesh-based ONoCs caused by thermal effect are systematically modeled and analyzed employing formal methods. Finally, we conduct case studies for mesh-based ONoCs using optimized crossbar optical router and crux optical router to evaluate the proposed method. The simulation results show that the performance of mesh-based ONoCs declines with the increase of temperature, such as the decrease of optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) and the increase of bit error rate (BER), which severely limits the network scalability. The formal analytical models provide a criterion for the performance analysis of thermal effect in ONoCs. In addition, the formal methods have high portability and scalability, and can provide technical support for future research work.","['Optical crosstalk', 'Optical waveguides', 'Optical losses', 'Thermal analysis', 'Adaptive optics', 'Optical refraction', 'Optical noise']","['Thermal effect', 'micro-ring resonators (MRs)', 'optical networks-on-chips (ONoCs)', 'optical crosstalk noise', 'optical losses']"

We analyzed the effect of the supercontinuum beam diameter and the crystal length to generate second harmonics. The walk-off effect on the second harmonics was also investigated; the efficiency was limited by the walk-off, and the beam of the second harmonic was out of shape. A tunable ultraviolet in the range of 285–340 nm is obtained with the pump of a visible supercontinuum, which is generated by a laser with an all-fiber device.

"Tuning the plasmonic resonance peak to the deep ultraviolet (DUV) band is critical for plasmonic-enhanced AlGaN-based DUV photodetector. However,the high refractive index of AlGaN layer seriously limits the plasmonic resonance peak in DUV band. Therefore, in this work, we study how various Al nanoparticles on the AlGaN layer surface affect the plasmonic resonance performance. Compared with the Al-based nanosphere, nanohemisphere and nanodisk, the Al-based nanorod is the most suitable candidate for AlGaN-based DUV photodetectors. This is because the DUV plasmonic dipolar mode excited from the upper part of nanorod is not affected by the interface between the nanorods and the AlGaN layer. However, the interface also leads to another plasmonic dipolar mode at longer wavelengths. Moreover, the DUV plasmonic resonance peak will be influenced by the diameter, the height and the Al 2 O 3 layer thickness. We also find that the diffraction can enhance the resonance peak intensity when the Al nanorod period is smaller than the resonance peak wavelength. Besides, to make the enhanced electric field located in active layer, a layer of Ga 2 O 3 shell is proposed to cover Al nanorods, which causes a quadrupole mode in DUV band excited from the sidewall of Al nanorods.","['Wide band gap semiconductors', 'Aluminum gallium nitride', 'Nanoparticles', 'Nanobioscience', 'Photodetectors', 'Metals', 'Indexes']","['AlGaN layer', 'Al nanoparticles', 'DUV', 'localized surface plasmon resonance']"
"We present a probabilistically shaped (PS) time-frequency-packing (TFP) wavelength-division multiplexing superchannel system employing higher order modulation (HoM) formats, with an objective to improve the spectral efficiency (SE). However, TFP systems suffer from inter-symbol interference (ISI) and/or inter-carrier interference (ICI). Additionally, the bandwidth limitations of the wavelength selective switches in the fiber link may cause severe ISI for the edge sub-channels (SCs) in a superchannel. Mitigation of such interferences is particularly challenging for HoM systems, since the implementation of the well-known turbo equalization schemes, such as the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv equalizer, is computationally challenging for larger constellations. In this paper, we investigate an expectation propagation based, computationally efficient, turbo decision feedback equalizer for ISI cancellation, in tandem with a parallel interference cancellation based ICI mitigation. By optimizing the parameters in the shaping and the packing dimensions, we show through our numerical results that the proposed PS-TFP superchannels enabling 1.8 Tbps data rates offer up to 1.05 dB packing gain over an unpacked system using the same modulation format, and a 1.15 dB shaping gain over an unshaped system that uses a lower modulation order to achieve the same SE.","['Wavelength division multiplexing', 'Decision feedback equalizers', 'Modulation', 'Gain', 'Parity check codes', 'Time-frequency analysis', 'Integrated optics']","['Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN)', 'time-frequency packing (TFP)', 'probabilistic shaping (PS)', 'decision feedback equalization (DFE)', 'expectation propagation (EP)', 'superchannel']"

"With the traditional multilayers coating, it is difficult to achieve broadband and wide-angle antireflection optical properties simultaneously. As one of the most promising candidates for omnidirectional and broadband antireflection coating, the moth-eye structure has gained considerable attention in the past several decades because of its excellent optical performance and self-cleaning function. The challenges in the use of this technology, namely, its manufacturing cost and mechanical structural stability, limit its popularization. In this paper, a moth-eye structure surface combined with a residual layer of an identical material is proposed; the proposed composite structure can be formed by a one-step process of half-etched technology. For the design and optimization of the composite moth-eye structure, composite structures were compared by performing effective medium approximation (EMA) and rigorous coupled– wave analysis (RCWA). The structural parameters of the micro–nano surface were optimized to increase the mechanical stability considerably. The results showed that the optimized composite moth-eye structure has high transmittance for incident angles from 0° to 80° in the infrared spectrum.

"Optical wireless data transmission from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to a sea-surface buoy has become a viable solution to support the increasing needs for many applications in the field of marine technology. Despite having unique characteristics and advantages, underwater wireless optical communication remains a challenging field due to the difficulties associated with the harsh marine environments and severe attenuation caused by the bubbles and particulates. This study aims to evaluate the uplink UWOC system in the presence of particles and bubbles under various wind speeds. To calculate the link distances and signal loss between a transmitter and a receiver of the UWOC system, simulations were performed with the inputs of the water optical properties obtained from the Bay of Bengal and Southern Ocean waters and bubble properties derived from the Hall-Novarini (HN) model. Consequently, the normalized received power were calculated for the different receiver configurations and oceanic conditions without and with bubbles. Our results showed that the received power decreased with the increasing wind speeds and smaller bubble populations. The angular and spatial distributions of the received beam increased for smaller bubble populations under high wind speeds. When compared to the clean bubbles, the received power slightly decreased for the non-absorbing coated bubbles with different film thicknesses (0.01 ∼ 1.0 μm) and increased for the absorbing coated bubbles with higher thicknesses (≥1 μm). These results will significantly help the system designer to develop and optimize an UWOC system under different bubble populations and wind speed conditions.","['Wind speed', 'Scattering', 'Water', 'Optical fiber communication', 'Oceans', 'Uplink', 'Ocean temperature']","['UWOC', 'uplink channel', 'optical communication', 'optical properties', 'bubbles', 'Monte Carlo method']"

"Effect of cerium codoping on Stokes or anti-Stokes luminescence of BiOCl:Er 3+ crystals, which were controlled by a special photon avalanche (PA) mechanism under 980-nm excitation, was investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicate that Ce 3+ ions were successfully doped into BiOCl lattices. However, in PA photoluminescence behaviors, the doped Ce 3+ ions did not present efficient resonant energy transfer (ET) processes between the Er 3+ ions as generally reported. As a result, the intensity of visible PA upconversion emission and 1.54μmdownshifting near-infrared (NIR) emission of Er 3+ ions shows the same concentration dependence of cerium dopants. This phenomenon can be understood by the influence of cerium dopant content on the magnitude of internal electric field in layered BiOCl crystals, which may play a more important role on the upconversion (UC) and NIR luminescence of Er 3+ than the traditional ET between rare-earth (RE) ions.

"We define a new kind of radially polarized twisted sinc-correlation Schell-model (RPTSCSM) source and establish the source parameter conditions necessary to produce a physical beam. With the help of the extended Huygens-Fresnel integral, Several typical numerical examples are provided to study the influence of the source parameter and turbulent parameter on the statistical properties of such beams on propagation. It is shown that the intensity profiles of such beams always exhibit rotation and self-splitting on propagation, which is caused by the twisted phase of the beams. Moreover, the light intensity splits into an array and maintains its array distribution in free space. While the array gradually evolves to a hollow distribution with a dark core in a turbulence medium, indicating that the light beam may automatically restore the radial polarized light intensity distribution in atmospheric turbulence after a certain distance of propagation. Compared with the intensity, the impact of the twisted factor on the degree of polarization is to produce noticeable distortion around its distribution centre. When propagating in a turbulent atmosphere, the degree of polarization of such beams exhibits well-turbulent resistance. The degree of coherence would also experience self-splitting and rotation caused by the twisted factor, and a turbulent atmosphere has an important influence on the degree of coherence.

"It is generally impossible to maintain tight focusing over a long distance because of diffraction; this so-called Rayleigh's curse may be broken for a femtosecond laser if the wavefront curvature varies with laser wavelength. This paper reports on a nonlinear technique to produce a wavelength-dependent wavefront. We reveal a wavelength-dependent wavefront mechanism that is induced in optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification (OPCPA) where the crystal effect of group-velocity mismatch (GVM) dominates. Both analytical and numerical investigations show that the sign of the produced wavefront can be changed by GVM, and the magnitude can be enhanced by multistage OPCPA. The results suggest that the Rayleigh range at a fixed beam waist size can be significantly increased by the OPCPA-induced wavelength-dependent wavefront.","['Laser beams', 'Laser excitation', 'Spatiotemporal phenomena', 'Lenses', 'Crystals', 'Chirp', 'Pump lasers']","['Optical parametric amplifiers', 'rayleigh range', 'spatiotemporal couplings']"

"Weak optical signal processing based on nonlinear effects offers new approaches for imaging through scattering media. A novel incoherent optical signal amplification method based on spatial modulation instability is proposed for imaging through fog. We experimentally demonstrated the amplification and recovery of degraded weak incoherent optical image signals after passing through dense fog in a photorefractive crystal. Our experimental results indicate that the intensity profiles of the output images can be redistributed from disordered to ordered when the nonlinear strength exceeds the threshold of incoherent modulation instability, which shows that the partially disordered incoherent probe light intensities are orderly transferred to enhance the signal intensity profiles and the residuals become a uniform background. The restored nonlinear output images with high visibility were observed for a proper optical thickness of fog, and weak optical imaging from undetectable to detectable with relatively poor visibility for a larger optical thickness was also realized in the experiment. This incoherent optical signal amplification method based on modulation instability has a potential application for image recovery in atmospheric scattering imagings.","['Optical imaging', 'Nonlinear optics', 'Stimulated emission', 'Optical scattering', 'Scattering', 'Imaging', 'Optical diffraction']","['Incoherent optical amplification', 'spatial modulation instability', 'fog', 'disordered', 'scattering imaging']"

"A new photonic-assisted instantaneous frequency measurement system is presented. It overcomes the latency problem in the reported structures based on the frequency-to-time mapping technique or the frequency-to-power mapping technique that involves a long length of fiber, and at the same time, enables the incoming microwave signal frequency to be measured over a wide frequency range with only small errors. The system generates three low-frequency signals. The phases of the three low-frequency signals are compared. One of the two low-frequency signal phase differences is used to estimate the incoming microwave signal frequency unambiguously over a wide frequency range and the other is used to provide accurate microwave signal frequency measurement. A proof-of-concept experiment is set up. Experimental results show, by measuring the phase difference of two low-frequency signals, the frequency of the input microwave signal can be determined unambiguously in 15 GHz and 500 MHz frequency ranges with errors below ±220 MHz and ±10 MHz respectively. Hence, by using two low-frequency signal phase differences, the input microwave signal frequency can be determined accurately over a wide frequency range. The new photonic-assisted frequency measurement system has a fast response time, which is an order of magnitude shorter than that of the systems based on the frequency-to-time mapping technique and the frequency-to-power mapping technique with a kilometer-long fiber.","['Frequency measurement', 'Radio frequency', 'Microwave measurement', 'Modulation', 'Optical fibers', 'Optical polarization', 'Optical reflection']","['Optical signal processing', 'microwave measurement', 'fiber optics links and subsystems', 'radio frequency photonics']"

"The papers in this special section focus on progress in photonic spin-order interaction (SOI). Spin and orbital angular momenta (SAM and OAM) are two distinct components of light beams. The SAM is associated with polarization of the light, whereas the OAM is related to a helical wave front, which has an azimuthal dependence of phase and can be described by a topological charge. These two different forms of AM are independent of each other within the boundaries of paraxial propagation in space. However, they become intertwined when the light beam is traveling through inhomogeneous and anisotropic media, or is tightly focused beyond the paraxial condition, leading to the photonic SOI. The photonic SOI underpins many optical processes, thus playing a significant role in the modern optics. The photonic SOI has led to such intriguing optical phenomena, as photonic spin Hall effect, orbit Hall effect, spin-orbit Hall effect, optical Skyrmion, and interconversions between the spin and the orbital terms, among others. Importantly, the photonic SOI also holds promise for potential applications in nanophotonic devices, quantum information processing, precise metrology, and optical (including quantum) sensing.","['Special issues and sections', 'Photonics', 'Optical polarization', 'Hall effect', 'Adaptive optics', 'Micromagnetics', 'Geometrical optics']",[]

It is shown that with a high crossover frequency of the drive system open-loop transfer function, and a current-loop that is much faster than the speed-loop, it is possible to use simplified s-domain motor transfer functions to design both the current-loop and speed-loop controllers. The simplifications allow students to concentrate on the task of designing the controllers without being distracted by unnecessary mathematical analysis. Experimental results show that satisfactory drive dynamic behaviour can be achieved despite these simplifications.

This marvellous French Huguenot and his party of French speaking Huguenots left the town of Orange after they had fled from France in 1688. Paul Roux, the first, in South Africa was Teacher, Doctor and Church Minister for this first group of French speaking Huguenots. He had seven children and made the earnest request that in each generation at least one son must be named after him, namely Paul. This reasonable request was carried out faithfully and consequently, my son, Dr Paul Roux, is Paul Roux the tenth, i.e. ten generations from the first Paul Roux our great and gifted leader of 1688.","['Government', 'Machinery', 'Sun', 'Jacobian matrices', 'Instruments', 'Ethics', 'Weapons']",[]

"The majority of papers on code synchronization loop design for DSSS communication systems concentrate on noncoherent schemes employing binary spreading sequences. These loop structures comprise early and late arm structures with squaring devices which are very prone to arm imbalance effects. In this paper a combined coherent carrier recovery and Decision-Directed Delay-Lock-Loop (DD-DLL) synchronization scheme for a DSSS communication system is proposed. The novelty of the technique lies in the fact that it extends the structure proposed by de Gaudenzi et al [1] to enable synchronisation of systems employing both binary and complex spreading sequences. Typical advantages include features such as less sensitivity to arm imbalance problems due to the elimination of squaring devices, improved tracking capability and simplified hardware by requiring only two correlators in stead of four in the DLL structure. The simplified loop structures is the direct result of the novel use of difference signals in both the spreading, demodulation/despreading and DLL processes, leading to the elimination of unwanted cross product interference terms when employing complex spreading sequences. The loop response is analysed analytically and its performance verified through computer simulation in the presence of AWGN and typical non-stationary channel effects, employing both binary as well as a relatively new family of complex Linearly and Non-Linearly Root-of-Unity (L- and NL-RU) filtered spreading sequences, including a recen tly introduced subclass of Analytical Bandlimited Complex (ABC) spreading sequences [2].","['Spread spectrum communication', 'Synchronization', 'Transmitters', 'Receivers', 'Clocks', 'Generators', 'Delays']","['DS/SSMA communication systems', 'Complex spreading sequences', 'Decision-directed delay-lock-loop', 'Synchronisation']"
"For a single-input controllable system the solution of the pole-placement problem, (using a linear feedback combination of state variables), results in a unique set of feedback-weighting coefficients. These coefficients may be calculated by a number of methods including matrix trace techniques. For multi-input systems there are a theoretically infinite number of combinations of feedback coefficients that satisfy the pole-placement condition. In practice, the choice is much more limited if the feedback coefficients are to be of acceptable magnitudes; thus there is a need for constraining the problem so that a practical design is produced. A semi-systematic way of achieving this goal is via the dyadic method [1] in which the feedback matrix is a product of two dyads. If the value of one of these dyads is specified, this is tantamount to assigning a weighting on each of the inputs, then the other may be found systematically by way of a “fictitious” single-input system model. This paper uses the dyadic method, in combination with matrix-trace techniques, to design feedback systems for the longitudinal flight dynamics of a helicopter, an observer for a single-input system (observer design is usually a multi-input problem), and to achieve both zero- and pole-placement for a particular, restricted class of system.","['Mathematical model', 'Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions', 'Control systems', 'Observers', 'Helicopters', 'Blades', 'Matrices']","['Pole placement', 'Dyads', 'Matrix Traces', 'Helicopter Flight-Dynamics', 'Observers']"

"Professor W. Buchanan (Member) : The present paper reminds one of the many discussions that took place some 15 to 20 years ago regarding the relative merits of alternating and direct current supply for town lighting, but it must now be admitted that considerable success has been attained with both systems. Since both the Ward-Leonard and the Three-Phase systems of winding seem to contain the elements necessary for success, the present controversy regarding their relative merits will no doubt reach a perfectly satisfactory conclusion. Although we may agree that it is preferable to use electricity instead of steam for all winding plants, it is very improbable that any one electric system will give the most economical results under all working conditions, — each case must be considered as a special problem, maximum economy being obtainable only by a careful study of the particular features and details of each system.","['Windings', 'Induction motors', 'Wires', 'Oils', 'Friction', 'Heating systems', 'Core loss']",[]

"The author assumes that members are already acquainted with the essential features of the Ward-Leonard and Three-Phase systems, and this paper is, therefore, confined mainly to a comparison of costs. The great advantages of the Ward-Leonard system, particularly safety and ease of control, are well-known and generally admitted, but the opponents of the system frequently consider its apparently high first cost prohibitive. The author proposes to show that even granting that the first cost is higher than for the Three-Phase system, in very many cases this is largely counterbalanced by the difference in working costs It would, of course, be impossible m a short paper such as this to institute comparisons between all possible cases, and the author is well aware that in many instances the working costs of the Three-Phase may be as low as those of the Ward-Leonard system but he is of opinion that in the majority of cases, and more particularly where hoists are installed for winding from deep shafts and at high speed, the determining factor must be by all means that of safety and not of cost, although the author holds that the latter are more favourable with the Ward-Leonard, as will be proved to you later on. It will no doubt be possible to so improve the Three-Phase control as to make the system as safe as the Ward-Leonard, but a comparison of executed examples of each undoubtedly points to the superiority of the latter m this respect.","['Windings', 'Rocks', 'Power demand', 'Generators', 'Shafts', 'Safety', 'Maintenance engineering']",[]

"It is only when a particular type of equipment starts giving excessive trouble that its importance to the community becomes apparent. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the case of electric cables — normally taken for granted by the average engineer and quite certainly to be buried and forgotten.

"This paper describes the arithmetic section of a digital correlator, which is used in conjunction with a mini-computer to perform real time spectral analysis of radio astronomy spectral line signals, having bandwidths of up to 5, 12 MHz. The radio astronomy signals are both noiselike and deeply buried in noise, much of which is contributed by the receiving system. The correlator employs 1 024 identical ‘channels’ to calculate correlation coefficients for 1 024 different values of delay. Each channel is capable of performing a multiplication and addition every 97,6 ns. The input signal is coarsely quantized into three levels (–1, 0 or + 1) in order to simplify the correlator circuitry at the expense of signal to noise ratio. By varying the clock rate, spectral bandwidths from 40 kHz to 5, 12 MHz may be analysed. The instrument may be used as a single 1 024 channel, dual 512 channel or quad 256 channel correlator. Both auto-correlation and cross-correlation may be performed on up to four signals or pairs of signals.

"The provision of variable frequency and voltage from a fixed frequency and constant voltage supply by the combination of two solid state switching converters is described. No intermediate dc link is employed and it is shown that the output voltage and supply currents contain no harmonic components below 300 Hz in a 6-step system. The converters are force-commutated and bi-directional and therefore capable of direct regeneration to the supply. Frequency is continuously variable from zero to a value which is only limited by the switch and motor losses. The results of a numerical analysis performed on a 3,5 kW, 3-phase induction motor when fed from the output of this converter, are described.

"A unique feature of DS-CDMA cellular networks is its universal frequency re-use concept In other words, neighbouring cells operate on the same frequency channels. Because of this universal frequency re-use concept, the admission of a user into the network affects the level of communication quality of all the other users. Call admission control then becomes critical and a new user will be accepted only if the additional interference that it creates does not degrade the overall communications quality of the already admitted users beyond some acceptable level. Most of the call admission control schemes that have been analysed in the literature are centralised in nature and there has not been much work done on distributed or decentralised schemes. This paper proposes a distributed call admission control protocol for DS-CDMA cellular networks. In this distributed scheme, channel access decisions are made by the mobiles based on information broadcast from the base stations. This is different from the access strategies that have appeared in the literature where call requests are processed solely by the base stations. Teletraffic performance measures that are considered are the probability of blocking calls, probability of forced termination, grade of service and outage.","['Base stations', 'Interference', 'Computer architecture', 'Microprocessors', 'Probability', 'Multiaccess communication', 'Call admission control']",[]

"Results of rain-attenuation prediction on earth-satellite paths in the USA, utilizing a rain-rate model based on southern African extreme rain-rate data, are presented. The model, based on Lin's extreme-value theory, was used to provide 5-minute rain-rate distributions. These were then used in an existing attenuation model to provide the attenuation distributions for a total of 16 earth-space paths, at frequencies of 11 to 29 GHz. Good agreement with the experimental distributions is obtained over a range of climates. These results, together with earlier results obtained with the prediction of 5-min rain-rate distributions in the USA, have brought about a high degree of confidence in the method for rain-attenuation prediction. The method should be useful, not only for the continental USA, but also for southern Africa. The method is easy to use. The rain-rate model requires only the mean annual rainfall and a designation of the location as climatically coastal or inland.","['Attenuation', 'Sea measurements', 'Predictive models', 'Rain', 'Ions', 'Africa', 'Read only memory']",[]
"The author wishes to thank those who contributed to the discussion on the broken-conductor problem at road crossings by overhead transmission lines. The deficiencies in his method of arriving at the sag under broken conductor condition are fully appreciated and were, in fact, detailed fairly fully in the paper. It is maintained, however, that the formula described gives a quick and ready means of checking whether sufficient clearance is obtained provided the user is aware of its limitations. It should not be overlooked that calculations of this nature are usually made for the maximum designed working temperature of the conductor whereas, it may be reasonably assumed, the line will trip out on a break occurring and the resulting cooling off of the conductor will cause it to lift by an amount which in most cases more than compensates for the optimistic result obtained with the formula.","['Conductors', 'Shafts', 'Lifting equipment', 'Poles and towers', 'Windings', 'Power transmission lines', 'Insulators']",[]
"In this paper a basic mode! for the cumulative probability distribution of the k-factor, commonly used in radio propagation studies for communications, is proposed. Available South African and Namibian data is used to test the model. Further investigation using regression analysis results in a set of coefficients, which could be used to predict the cumulative probability for various values of the k-factor in South Africa. It is clear from the analyses that there may be climatic factors, which must still be incorporated in the proposed model in a statistical manner. Although the available data is limited in terms of the numbers of observational sites, the proposed model suggests that it may be possible to make significantly better predictions of the k-factor than the simplistic 4/3rds earth approach, and thus to extend the limited coverage of the available observations","['Refractive index', 'Earth', 'Atmospheric modeling', 'Regression analysis', 'Planning', 'Mathematical model', 'Indexes']","['Radiowave propagation', 'effective earth radius', 'k-factor']"

"This paper examines the problem of designing an underground mine so as to optimise the development and haulage costs. It focusses particularly on the costs associated with the ramps and shafts which provide passage to and from the ore zones. This mine optimisation problem is modelled as a weighted network. The controls (variables for the optimisation process) and operational constraints are described. A main constraint in mining networks is that all ramps have gradients no more than a given maximum value m. In this paper we describe the mine design problem as an optimisation problem, and prove that under reasonable conditions the cost function of an underground mining network with maximum gradient constraint m is convex. The convexity of the objective function ensures the existence of minimum cost mining networks, and theoretically any descent algorithms for finding minimal points can be applied to the design of minimum cost mining networks.","['Shafts', 'Junctions', 'Topology', 'Ores', 'Mathematical model', 'Network topology', 'Meters']","['underground mine', 'optimisation', 'convex function']"

This latter assumption is rather a big one to make, as it is not often that such a condition holds good. The more difficult problem is to determine this power factor, and with ordinary instruments practically an impossibility, as about full load the variation of power factor is exceedingly small and cannot be determined in the ordinary way. A further requirement, surely, is the efficiency of the motor, but this seems to be neglected: without this, how can the performance of the motor be determined ?

"Noise is best defined as ‘unwanted sound’ and the most obvious reason for its abatement is the annoyance factor, because this is generally the yardstick by which the average person classifies and determines whether a sound is, in fact, noise. Unfortunately, from the point of view of physical science, annoyance criteria are very difficult to establish as so much is dependent upon the psychological effect on the individual and the appropriate circumstances, that hard and fast rules based on fact or precedence are most difficult to co-relate. Nevertheless, in recent years physicists in co-operation with psychologists have made considerable progress, in relating mans' reaction to different types of noise in various situations1. The results of this type of work are extremely important for the purpose of community planning and the design of corrective measures should the annoyance factor be present. By this is implied that although it is theoretically possible to eliminate an annoying source of noise, it is seldom economical to do so completely; the most effective design, therefore, is that which reduces the overall effect of the noise to a point where it ceases to be annoying. The establishment of criteria of annoyance are therefore essential to the art of effective abatement.","['Noise level', 'Auditory system', 'Frequency measurement', 'Psychology', 'Noise measurement', 'Standards', 'Meters']",[]

"As the traffic on a LAN increases, the response deteriorates and the rate of increase in the throughput also decreases. One of the most frequently used methods of alleviating the problem is to divide the LAN up into two or more LANs linked by bridges. This paper shows that a bridge may not necessarily improve the performance on LANs, but compound the problem. A LAN bridge atempts to limit traffic to those LANs linking the LAN of the source station and that of the destination station, but the bridge also introduces a delay, for packets passing from one LAN to the other. This may not give the improved performance that was expected from the bridge link. Several of the key load and device related factors, which must be considered in assessing bridged-LAN performance, are discussed.

"(Member): I will first suppose that this machine is able to produce an E.M.F. and consider what some of the results will be following from the design. First, we have a 12 pole field producing bunches of lines running more or less radially through what might be termed the field distribution ring; and passing very rapidly through these bunches we have numerous very large and quite solid armature teeth — surely these teeth will heat up very considerably. Then conversely when the machine is running and the rotor is excited the armature teeth will carry round bunches of lines which will produce eddy currents in the field distribution ring. Again the excited rotor poles will, in proportion as the reluctance of the complete magnetic path rises and falls, generate an increasing and decreasing current in the field coils of the stator, and since all these coils are in series and wound with fine wire, the potential at the terminals will probably be excessive. Now most of these effects could be obviated by using a one coil field construction which would give a smooth field distribution, and such a design, based on the inventor's line of thought, can be made very much more simply and cheaply. I made a small rough model to see if any effect whatever could be obtained, but though I forced about 3 amp. through the fine wire windings there was no tendency to turn in either direction, nor could one feel any sense of lag when turning the model and then switching on the current.","['Rotors', 'Force', 'Compressors', 'Coils', 'Wires', 'Windings', 'Torque']",[]

"One of the first points to note in internal combustion motor operation, whether of the reciprocating or turbine type, is that we are dealing with a mechanism operated directly by forces developed by “explosion” or “combustion.” These two terms “explosion” and “combustion” provide the keys which are being used today to unlock the mysteries of the phenomenon known as “detonation.” Whatever may be the true explanation of this elusive characteristic in fuel reactions with air or oxygen, the reason for its annoying effects on internal combustion motor performance is clear enough. We know that to obtain sweet performance of any mechanism there must be conformity between the rate of application of the force applied at any instant and the velocity of the mechanism at that instant, otherwise much of the energy delivered will be dissipated in impact losses. The more rapid the application of the force and the slower the moving mechanism the greater will be the magnitude of that energy loss. The factors which contribute towards detonation effects are numerous, but those most directly involved may be summarised in order of importance as follows","['Combustion', 'Fuels', 'Engines', 'Hydrocarbons', 'Sparks', 'Temperature', 'Gases']",[]

The effect of geological formations, heights of towers, span lengths, etc., are discussed, and the performance of an instrument for recording lightning strokes is described. Part II of the paper compares the actual with the estimated performance of the 88-kV line and curves and data are included to indicate the probable performance of typical lines of various voltages up to and including 220-kV. Recommendations for outage levels are made and the earthing conditions to meet them are discussed. Standard impulse insulation levels for transmission lines are suggested, and the factors governing the design of lightning-resistant lines are enumerated.","['Lightning', 'Poles and towers', 'Ions', 'Ammeters', 'Magnetic shielding', 'Magnetic noise', 'Current measurement']",[]

"The failure of software development projects has been a cause for concern for a long time. South Africa's software development industry is no exception. In fact, in South Africa the majority of the software development organizations are small to medium sized. Some even have one developer developing large systems. As is common with software development organizations, most of the applications are developed without following any development methodology and sometimes without following any project management methodology. This scenario leaves the South African industry prone to failures and catastrophes that have devastated the software industry for many years. This review aims to bring an awareness of an emerging software development discipline called Agile methodologies that claims to deal adequately with issues such as the social side of software development, where the interactions among developers, users, customers, managers and the proposed system actually affect the quality, cost, and time of software development.","['Software', 'Industries', 'Unified modeling language', 'Planning', 'Programming', 'Internet', 'Software engineering']","['Agile methodologies', 'traditional methodologies', 'rigorous methodologies', 'iterative incremental development']"

The method, which is based on an analysis of the system's equilibrium points, is illustrated using three examples, including one which exhibits chaotic behaviour. Using the proposed methodology, the design of controllers for such systems is shown to present no great difficulties, provided that the desired modes of the linearized process are controllable.","['Process control', 'Xenon', 'Lyapunov methods', 'Systematics', 'Linear systems', 'Closed loop systems', 'Asymptotic stability']","['Equilibrium surface methodology', 'nonlinear processes', 'chaotic systems', 'nonlinear control']"

"The earliest report on contact rectification dates back to 1874 when Braun published the results he obtained from experiments with natural metallic sulphides and also with some specially prepared compounds suitably arranged between contact clamps. Branley subsequently studied the rectifying properties of copper oxide in contact with different metals. In 1904, Midgley described a detector consisting of an asymmetrical junction between a metal such as silver and a metal oxide such as silver oxide or copper oxide. In the following four years the crystal detector appeared and reports on the characteristics of crystal detectors or rectifiers were published by Dunwoody, Pearce and others. In 1908 Thompson patented the first copper oxide rectifier. This consisted of a small copper disc on the one edge of which an artificial layer of oxide was produced by the action of heat. This was pressed against a soft metal electrode of lead or tin. In the years following up to 1925 may types of contact rectifiers were described and patented The latter year saw the commercial development the contact rectifiers. The two principal developments were the cupric sulphide rectifier described by Ruben, and the copper oxide rectifier described by Grondahl and his associates. The former type is of the low resistance class and is mainly used for high current densities. This type has received scant treatment in the literature on the subject. The latter type is of the high resistance class and is better adapted to the case where the current to be passed is small.","['Rectifiers', 'Selenium', 'Metals', 'Resistance', 'Lead', 'Electrodes', 'Copper']",[]

"In hierdie artikel word gekyk na die gebruik van 'n versadigbare kapasitor as 'n afskakelgapser, wat 'n aan/af-skakelende elektroniese drywingskomponent beveilig. Hierdie gapserbaan tree as hulpstroombaan op deur die lokus van die drywingskakelaar tydens die afskakeloorgang gunstiger te dwing. Alhoewel daar tot dusver uitsluitlik gebruik gemaak is van lineêre kapasitore – dit is kapasitore waarvan die kapasitansie konstant bly – word in hierdie artikel aangetoon dat die gebruik van 'n nie-lineêre kapasitor, waarvan die kapasitansie spanningsafhanklik is, groot voordele inhou, veral vanuit 'n energie-oogpunt beskou. Ná 'n inleiding oor die gebruik van gapsers by hoëfrekwensie-drywingseiektroniese energie-omvorming, word daar eerstens na die nie-lineêre kapasitor gekyk. Hierna word hierdie versadigbare kapasitor as nie-lineêre gapserelement beskou deur dit kwantitatief met die bekende lineêre kapasitor te vergelyk. Uit die ontleding blyk dit duidelik dat die nie-lineêre kapasitor as die algemene geval beskou kan word, met die lineêre kapasitor as die spesiale (onversadigde) geval. Berekende krommes wat die gestoorde energie in die kapasitor as 'n funksie van die spanning aantoon, asook die invloed van die nie-lineêre afskakelgapser op beide die afskakelverlies in die drywingskakelaar en die totale energieverlies in die stelsel weens die skakeloorgang, word getoon. 'n Eksperimentele meting is ook uitgevoer om die gesimuleerde resultate te toets. Uit al die resultate blyk dit dat kommersiële keramiese kapasitore met 'n ongekompenseerde ferroelektrikum, wat goed versadig word d.m.v. 'n relatiewe groot spanning, sowat 1/10 van die hoeveelheid energie stoor wat 'n ooreenkomste lineêre kapasitor by dieselfde eindspanning stoor. Terselfdertyd word kwantitatief aangetoon dat die nie-lineêre afskakelgapser ongeveer dieselfde gapsing vir die drywingskakelaar verskaf in vergelyking met die lineêre gapser, veral vir groter relatiewe kapasitansiewaardes. Die artikel word afgesluit met 'n kritiese beskouing van die voordele en beperkings verbonde aan bestaande nie-lineêre kapasitore vir gapsertoepassings.","['Integrated circuits', 'Transistors', 'Snubbers', 'Barium']","['Gapsers', 'nie-lineêre gapsers', 'versadigbare kapasitore', 'drywingselektroniese skakeling']"

"The Action of the X-Ray in Large and Small Doses. — Since the discovery of the X-rays and their application to therapeutics, many and various results have been obtained from their use, results often quite contradictory in character, the explanations of which have at times been distinctly puzzling.

In recent years, however means have been devised of regulating the dose of the X-rays and of estimating in units the amount of radiation being administered in each case. This has made the study of the action more accurate and has enabled the illumination of several obscure points. In the Berliner klinische Wochenschrift for May 23, 1910, H. E. Schmidt reports a small series of experiments into the effect of various doses of the X-ray upon cell growth. Having soaked a number of beans in water for six hours he treated the different beans with different doses of rays, and then planted them. His results were quite uniform and demonstrated two points of interest. Whereas those beans which were treated with large doses of the rays were partially or completely inhibited in their growth, as compared to untreated control beans, those which received very small doses were distinctly stimulated; not only were the plants larger and more vigorous, but the flowers were larger and the resulting crop of beans better. From these findings Schmidt suggests that the same principle may apply to animal cells, and experiments which he carried out on an ulcer on the arm suggested that this is the case. If this be so, it is evident that in treating conditions in which healing is desired, as a sluggish ulcer, very small doses of the X-ray should be used, whereas in cases of malignant growth, where tissue destruction is required, large doses are needed, and small doses instead of destraying the neoplasm may do harm rather than good by stimulating it to renewed activity. — Electrical Review and Western Electrician, July 30. 1910, p. 234.","['Lead', 'Circuit faults', 'Electric breakdown', 'Soil', 'Shafts', 'Rails', 'Earth']",[]

If no tail rope is used, and the load on the up-going cage is just balanced by the load on the down-going cage, then the rope weight will, in the first half-trip, exercise a positive, and in the second half a negative torque, and the winding machine has at first to act as a motor and then as a brake.","['Induction motors', 'Torque', 'Resistance', 'Brakes', 'Windings', 'Generators', 'Regulators']",[]

Mr. Noel Murray, a member of the Council of the Institute, desired that the municipal authorities be approached in the matter, as at present there was an enormous amount of bad work being put in. The only way to obviate this, in Mr. Murray's opinion, was to issue licenses to the wiremen in the same way as is done with engine drivers and plumbers. which would give the authorities control over the men. If a man wired a building in a faulty manner, then he should have his license suspended for six or twelve months, and this would be the means of raising the standard of work in the wiring world. A man should also be made responsible for the material used as well as for the work done. Mr. P. Rosling, the newly-elected president of the Institute, stated that the committee had considered the matter, but nothing could be done without passing au Act of Parliament. He therefore suggested that the matter should be left over until the wiremen's wages board was settled. Mr. E. H. W.

"(C.) 435/10. Arthur Martin Ludwig Dammrich (1), Charles Hansen (2) Improvements m means for conveying and distributing water or other liquids in mines and the like. 3.9.10. This invention relates to means for conveynig and distributing water or other liquids in mines or any other place where the conditions met with are more or less similar to those in underground workings. The special object that the inventors have ha in view is to lay out or provide a water service in a mine, or any other place where the conditions are analogous, in such a way that the pipe system shall not be subjected to excessive hydraulic pressure whatever may be the vertical distance between the points of supply and the lowest point of the distributing system. It is claimed that the improved system is applicable for conveying and distributing water or other liquids to any depth without exceeding a safe pressure, such pressure, if so desired, not to exceed, say. 50 lb to the square inch or thereabouts. Briefly stated, the invention consists of supply tanks in each level fitted with a float, an electric contact for signalling when the tank is empty a tap for drawing off the water as required, and an overflow pipe near the top of the tank to act as an air vent and overflow outlet The main supply pipe is taken from the surface to the bottom of the first tank, and from a point in this tank, below the level of the overflow pipe, a pipe is taken to the bottom of the second tank which acts as the supply pipe to that tank. Similarly, the water is taken from level to level throughout the mine. It will be obvious therefore, that as long as the capacity of the overflow pipes fitted to the tanks is greater than that of the mail supply pipe, the hydraulic pressure in any section will not be greater than that due to the vertical head between the tanks in the levels above and below the section in question.","['Induction motors', 'Technological innovation', 'Liquids', 'Logic gates', 'Rotors', 'Resistance', 'Hydraulic systems']",[]

"Conducted common mode EMI in switchmode power supplies originates due to an excess or deficiency in charge required by the physical circuit structure, in order to attain the operational potentials. As the operational potentials change during switching conditions, the required charge must be drawn from an external source, giving rise to a common mode current. The physics of this process is explained, and a simple but effective experimental procedure is described in order to determine the charge distribution, and self-capacitances of points in a physical circuit. Mitigation of the common mode current problem by means of an internal charge balance is presented.","['Capacitance', 'Electric potential', 'Switches', 'MOSFET', 'Current measurement', 'Resistors', 'Electromagnetic interference']","['Electromagnetic interference', 'Common mode EMI', 'EMI Mitigation', 'Switching power supplies']"

"The shortcomings of conventional pulse amplifiers for radar with respect to ringing, shortest pulse still amplified and signal-to-noise ratio are investigated. Integrating methods using the gating technique are shown to eliminate ringing, make the amplification of shorter pulses possible and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The improvement in signal-to-noise ratio is achieved at the expense of the speed with which information can be received. The amplification of d.c. pulses is investigated by the simple gate, the double gate and the phase-modulated gate. All three methods eliminate ringing and enable the amplification of shorter pulses. With respect to noise reduction, the simple gate is shown to be inferior to the other two methods due to flicker noise of valves at low frequencies. Neglecting flicker noise, the improvement in signal power to noise power ratio, by using any of the three methods, is equal to the ratio of pulse recurrence frequency to the bandwidth of the amplifier following the gate. An experimental double-gate amplifier is described. The measured signal-to-noise ratio was slightly below the theoretical value, but an improvement of 31 db was nevertheless achieved by gating. The application of the gating technique to a.c. pulses is considered and methods to produce the necessary a.c. pulses locked to the leading edges of d.c. modulating pulses are described.","['Bandwidth', 'Logic gates', 'Harmonic analysis', 'Frequency modulation', 'Valves', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Limiting']",[]

"The single lumped-element equivalent circuit model fails for inclined strip dipoles near a microstrip feedline. A new three-port S-parameter model for the isolated inclined dipole is introduced. The new model is accurate, but simple, and is used in an iterative design procedure for linear arrays of strip dipoles which are proximity-coupled to a continuous microstrip feedline. Previously available design methods are extended by allowing the dipoles to be inclined in the plane of the substrate. This gives flexibility regarding polarization. The design procedure is accurate if mutual coupling via guided mode scattering dominates coupling via radiation and surface waves. The important case of 45° inclination angle is investigated in some detail. Arrays using dipoles parallel or perpendicular to the feedline can be designed as special cases of the method.","['Scattering parameters', 'Integrated circuit modeling', 'Power transmission lines', 'Microstrip', 'Mutual coupling', 'Microstrip antenna arrays', 'Impedance']",[]

"The recording of the thermal properties of objects by optical remote sensing is based on the fact that surfaces at natural environmental temperatures emit radiation predominantly at infrared wavelengths. In consequence, airborne thermal infrared reconnaissance is concerned with the 3 μm to 30 μ m region of the spectrum to measure thermal characteristics in a ground (or water) scene. Since practical photographic emulsions are not sensitive at these wavelengths, solid state devices are needed to detect the emitted radiation. An efficient way of producing a thermal image of the scene over which an aircraft passes is to use a scanning radiometer or linescanner. This paper describes some concepts involved in designing a high performance linescanner. Particular reference is made to the design considerations of a custom-made linescanner (21) capable of recording multispectral thermal imagery with high thermal and spatial resolution. Use of this instrument in a geological application is also described and an example of thermal imagery presented. 10 Summary The concepts involved in the recording of the emitted IR radiation from a ground scene as imaged by an advanced IR line scanner operated from an aircraft have been described. In particular the RS-25 IR line scanner manufactured by Texas Instruments is discussed and a detailed breakdown of its optical and electronic design features is given. These non-standard features were incorporated in order to recover IR imagery of the same spatial and radiometric fidelity maintained by the high performance detector system and scan optics. The RS-25 described is presently a unique system, custom-made for the purpose of geological exploration in Southern Africa. An example of a geological application is given in which thermal differences within a geological sequence were recorded.

"Many researchers tend to employ analysis/synthesis techniques in the coding of speech for use in cochlear implants (bionic ear). In systems employing 6 or 8 electrodes, as in the system described in this paper, the non-linearity of the stop consonants suggests that other features may be utilized for their synthesis. An alternative strategy to analysis/synthesis, is the recognition/synthesis strategy, which is proposed in this paper. We propose a strategy in which a linear mapping of the speech spectrum onto the cochlea is used in the case of vowels, while non-linear recognition/synthesis is used in the case of the stop consonants. Such a strategy ensures that the stop consonants always sound the same and are thus easier for the patient to learn, provided that a correct recognition is performed. Very promising results were obtained and it even suggests the possibility of creating a natural sounding cochlear prosthesis.","['Electrodes', 'Prosthetics', 'Ear', 'Speech recognition', 'Speech coding', 'Time-frequency analysis', 'Task analysis']",[]

"This paper assesses the performance of commercially available systems, noting their strengths and weaknesses and proposes a novel system offering superior performance. The criteria defining the system performance are presented, with particular emphasis placed on an assessment of the volumes of detection. A novel volume of detection offering superior features is discussed along with the horn-lens fed cylindrical reflector antenna combination required to establish this. Comparative tests performed on the new system and a common system using a cheese antenna are given. It is shown that the new volume of detection offers substantial advantages in terms of the important system criteria. Several results from the field trial of the prototype are included to emphasise the substantial improvements, both financial and in performance, of the new system over commercially available systems presently in use.","['Antennas', 'Reflector antennas', 'Dairy products', 'Horn antennas', 'Shape', 'Sensitivity', 'Receiving antennas']","['Microwave intrusion detection system', 'horn-lens combination', 'shaped cylindrical reflector', 'volume of detection']"
"Describes improvised apparatus for detecting midget submarines, installed at Durban harbour entranco in 1942. The entrance to this harbour is bet.ween two parallel breakwatBrs some 1 ] 00 yards long and 250 yards apart. Two loops of 6-coro submarine cable each 150 feet wide were laid acros.., the channel with a spacing of 700 foet between cent,ros. Theso two loops of six turns each are connected in opposition, with a Grassot fluxInoter in shunt. A deflection of the fluxmeter is convcrt.t:\d to an audible warning by means of a photo tube, amplifier relay and alarm bell. A midget submarine 50 feet long entering at 3 knots will produce an indication of some 10 seconds duration when ovor either loop; and these indications will be separated by an interval of 110 seconds duration while the submarine is between the two loops. Depth chargo throwers were mounted on the breakwater to doal with any submarino detected.","['Underwater vehicles', 'Relays', 'Photoelectricity', 'Magnetic flux', 'Instruments', 'Underwater cables', 'Seaports']",[]

"It was with interest I read the paper by Mr. Keller introducing a discussion on lead accumulators, and I think a word of congratulation is due to the author for introducing this very important but neglected electrical engineering unit. Batteries have failed after a few years of service through, in a majority of instances, ignorance and neglect, and I have often heard engineers say that they would not have a battery in the place, as it is too much trouble to look after them, I would like to outline from my point of view what I consider some of the most important points in the maintenance of a battery, I am not going to touch on the technical and chemical details, but more or less try and deal with some of the practical points for maintenance. The most important point to my way of thinking is the steps to be taken when a battery is to be installed new. On the question of erection, in the majority of instances the details are supplied by the makers, detailing the stands, insulators, separators, etc. The battery may be well fitted together, and its electrical connections may be all that is desired, but when this is all done the point is, and the most important point is, what is put into the battery in the way of acid and water. One cannot emphasize too much the correct chemical contents of these two items. If proper attention is not given in the smallest detail to the correct electrolyte, then the battery must suffer in the years to come, and no matter how careful one may be after, the battery is sure to suffer should any trace of iron, etc., be left in the electrolyte.","['Batteries', 'Standards', 'Sockets', 'Metals', 'Electron tubes', 'Particle separators', 'Maintenance engineering']",[]

"The Aim of this paper is to examine the causes of insulator pm corrosion on d.c. insulators, and to this end experiments were conducted to determine the relative effect of different contaminations on leakage currents, in the presence of moist atmospheres. Further experiments were performed to explain the presence of brush discharge and to examine a few methods of alleviating pin corrosion. It was learned from these experiments that salt was the most important contaminating factor, soot a lesser factor and an acid film the least important factor. The average type of contamination acquired m service, containing neither visible salt nor soot, was of a nature intermediate between a pure salt and a pure soot film. It was thought that brush discharge occurred because of the contaminated condition of the underside of the insulator. With regard to preventive measures it was found that an insulating coat over the pin proved effective experimentally in reducing leakage current, but this has been found unsatisfactory in practice. Conversely a method found to be effective in operation, namely, that of surrounding the base of the pin with a lead washer, did not, under laboratory conditions, reduce leakage current. The conclusions reached were that load washers prevent corrosion by providing an alternative source of metal for electro-deposition; in addition the lead itself is inert to acid or atmospheric corrosion. It was thought that corrosion could be reduced by setting the pin in lead and by increasing the leakage distance of the upper portion of the insulator.","['Insulators', 'Pins', 'Leakage currents', 'Lead', 'Humidity', 'Corrosion', 'Pollution measurement']",[]

"Meteor Burst Communication Links offer the facility for transmitting data via trails of ionised particles, which form continually as meteors enter our atmosphere. Unfortunately, this propagation medium is exposed to countless external disturbances, and is therefore inherently noisy. Most commercial systems have overcome this difficulty by means of Automatic Repeat Request (AHQ) protocols, where received frames containing errors are simply retransmitted. This paper investigates the viability of an alternative system, viz. the Forward Error Correcting (FEC) protocol, where sufficient redundancy is inserted at the transmitter to enable correction of the noise-corrupted bits by the receiver. An accurate simulation of the complete link was implemented in software (C), effectively modelling the encoding, modulation, noise-corruption, demodulation and decoding processes. Four coding schemes were examined (Reed-Solomon, Golay, Viterbi and Iwadare), and comprehensive testing was performed using live trail data.

"Sequence discriminators have been proposed for use as wide-band quadrature phase shift networks. This article briefly describes the operation of these networks, and derives an expression for the phase shift of a simple RC sequence discriminator. Equiripple quadrature phase shift networks were designed using this expression, and their actual responses compared against the theory. A set of design curves giving equal phase error off quadrature for different bandwidths and network sizes is presented. The sensitivity of these networks were investigated using Monte Carlo analysis and the results summarised. On the basis of these results, a design rule giving the least sensitive network configuration is presented. An active variation of the network is investigated and shown to have a far lower sensitivity.","['Sensitivity', 'Bandwidth', 'Resistors', 'Transfer functions', 'Capacitors', 'Loading', 'Signal resolution']","['Sequence Discriminators', 'Quadrature Phase Shift Networks']"

"It is not very many years ago that the corrosion of metals was considered, more or less, as an unavoidable evil, but the enormous field for saving directed the attention of the world's scientific workers to this subject, with the resultant development of the electro-chemical theory of corrosion, which is now generally accepted as the one best explaining a multitude of facts concerning the corrosion of metals. This theory suggests that all corrosion is due to the flow of current through an electrolyte connecting the anodic and cathodic areas. It is not the intention of this paper to discuss metallic corrosion in general, but to outline briefly that small, although important section of the problem which affects the life of buried metallic structures, such as cable sheaths, water and gas pipes, concrete reinforcing, etc., and which is commonly known as “Electrolytic Corrosion.”","['Corrosion', 'Metals', 'Steel', 'Lead', 'Iron', 'Concrete', 'Earth']",[]

This paper analyses the transient and steady state behaviour of a three phase induction motor supplied from a current source inverter. It replaces the blocks of stator current by a truncated Fourier series and evaluates the required number of harmonics to use in order to ensure acceptably accurate results. Rectangular as well as trapezoidal blocks of stator current are considered and the results show that the torque pulsations due to trapezoidal current waveforms are smaller than those due to rectangular current waveforms. Commutation circuits in the inverter could therefore be used to ensure required trapezoidal waveforms in order to ensure certain reduced torque pulsations.,"['Induction motors', 'Harmonic analysis', 'Torque', 'Inverters', 'Stator windings', 'Rotors', 'DC motors']",[]

"The paper presents a method for analysing the dynamic and transient behaviour of synchronous generators in a multigenerator power system. The method describes the generator as well as the transmission network by their nonlinear two-axis equations, thereby allowing for the effects of shunt and series capacitive network elements. It is completely general and is not only applicable to a predetermined network configuration. The nonlinear equations are linearized in order to carry out an eigenvalue analysis of the system's small signal stability. A computer program has been developed which allows the user simply to specify the network topology, loads and generators of the system. The program then automatically configures the network, sets up all the equations, carries out a load flow solution for steady initial conditions, and calculates the transient response. The results of a two generator case study show the effects of shunt loads and series capacitive elements on the system's response.","['Rotors', 'Ions', 'Mathematical model', 'Generators', 'Stators', 'Transient analysis', 'Random access memory']",[]

It is shown that WPT efficiency increases not only at the uniform or taper distribution but also when the field intensity is raised at the edges of the radiating apertures.

There are severe limitations to the connection end location of the coils of a tutor winding so that they produce a satisfactory revolving field. The influence of these restrictions can be formulated in terms of modulating functions which yield a series of revolving field components. This technique is readily extended co solid state frequency and voltage converters in which the stator phase connections are continuously altered relative to the supply. Relationships are preserved which enable the calculation of the angular velocities and magnitudes of the revolving fields produced by a practical stator winding when excited by a fundamental and a series of harmonic voltages. Converter output voltages may be calculated and it is shown how motor currents may then be reconverted to find the supply currents.,"['Harmonic analysis', 'Frequency conversion', 'Conductors', 'Angular velocity', 'AC motors', 'Windings', 'Coils']",[]
"This paper presents an overview on the lightning research and studies carried out by the Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais - CEMIG (Brazil), in its Lightning Research Programme. This Programme started with the measurement of the keraunic levels (number of thunderstorm days per year) and lightning current intensities on transmission, distribution and telecommunication towers, using magnetic links. Later the Programme was extended to include a lightning-flash counter network (cloud-to-ground flash densities), a lightning research station (Cachimbo Station) and a lightning detection and tracking system (LPATS). In parallel to this Programme, the CEMIG also undertook a systematic survey of soil resistivity and tower-footing resistances, as well as a survey on the lightning performance of power lines and telecommunication stations. The data obtained so far, especially from the research station and the tracking system, are considered as preliminary and are still being carefully analysed.","['Lightning', 'Poles and towers', 'Soil', 'Conductivity', 'Systematics', 'Storms', 'Earth']",[]
"A transient suppression technique is presented for utilisation in channel simulators which are required to simulate very low fading rates. The fading is simulated by driving specially designed narrow band digital filters with two independent random Gaussian processes, resulting in a Rayleigh amplitude and uniform phase distribution of any signal subjected to (i.e. multiplied by) the outputs of the fading filters. Transients appearing at a filter output as a result of an input sequence before time k=0, when the simulator is switched on, hamper the effective use of the simulators. In this paper a systematic procedure is developed whereby the transients can be eliminated by specifying the initial conditions of the fading filters to ensure a stationary filter output at time k = 0. It is shown that this simple but effective transient suppression technique may also be used to incorporate random Frequency Hopping (FH) in existing fading channel simulators. A well known “step-down” procedure is employed to calculate a matrix which is multiplied by a vector of independent, zero mean, unit variance, Gaussian random variables to obtain the initial conditions of the narrow band fading filters. In order to emulate FH, the proposed algorithm is not only applied during the initialisation period of the channel simulator, but is thereafter re-executed whenever the simulator is required to emulate channel conditions at the next hopping frequency. Results are included to demonstrate that the detrimental effects of frequency hopping in digital communication systems can indeed be effectively and realistically emulated by this algorithm, without any sign of unwanted transient effects.","['Transient analysis', 'Digital filters', 'Filtering theory', 'Filtering algorithms', 'Switches', 'Rayleigh channels', 'Mathematical model']","['Transient suppression', 'channel simulation', 'frequency hopping', 'digital shaping filters', 'auto-regressive moving average (ARMA)']"

"A two dimensional Finite Element/Boundary Element (FE/BE) method for solving electromagnetic scattering from human cross-sections has been investigated, implemented, validated and used to investigate — approximately — the electromagnetic interaction of a manpack radio with its operator. Validation has been done by comparing results computed using analytical solutions for scattering from multi-layered right circular dielectric cylinders with line source excitation. The problem of a manpack antenna, which by definition radiates in the very close presence of the operator, has been approximated by a two dimensional model of a representative human cross-section with a line source radiating cylindrical waves modelling the antenna. From the FE/BE method solution one can obtain approximations of the near fields in and around the human cross-section, as well as the far-fields. This enables one to calculate the power dissipated in the human cross-section (the effect of the radio on the operator) as well as the influence of the human cross-section on the far-field pattern of the line source (i.e., the effect of the operator on the radio). We comment on possible applications to radiation hazard evaluation for personnel, and also outline further work required in this field.","['Finite element analysis', 'Antenna radiation patterns', 'Mathematical model', 'Computational modeling', 'Finite difference methods', 'Nonhomogeneous media', 'Material properties']",[]

"(Associate) : Mr. G. V. Adendorff in his paper says — ""It is well known that there is no electric force within a closed conductor, and the obvious method then is to completely surround the line in a metallic shield."" This statement, though quite correct when statical charges only are under consideration, is by no means so when dynamical charges are dealt with as in the case of lightning discharges. In order to be sure of this point I have performed experiments (under Professor Buchanan's guidance) in the laboratory of the School of Mines, using a Whimshurst machine and Leyden jars to produce a miniature lightning flash, of the type known as the ""B"" flash, to use Sir Oliver Lodge's nomenclature. The first experiment was to see if one wire from a tin plate was sufficient to protect a second earthed wire under the tin plate : AB being the tin plate : earthed by means of AC : DE being the wire it was required to protect. When DE was close to AB it was found that a spark could be obtained between E and AB. A second wire was added from B to earth, to make the earthing of AB more symmetrical, but still a spark could be obtained between E and AB. To make the experiment yet more conclusive, the wire ED was surrounded by a metallic conductor — a piece of steel pipe. The connections of the apparatus were as shown in the diagram, Pig. 2. The pipe was connected to the tin plate to which the knob D was fixed by means of three copper wires, the object being to leave a space through which the gap EF could be watched. An electrostatic voltmeter was connected across the small gap EF. On a spark occurring across AB, a ""B"" flash occurs between C and D, and a small spark can be obtained between E and F. Thus the wire is not protected, although surrounded by a closed metallic conductor. A momentary deflection is produced on the electrostatic voltmeter.","['Wires', 'Conductors', 'Discharges (electric)', 'Windings', 'Voltmeters', 'Tin', 'Lightning']",[]
"(Visitor): For the design of proper protective gear against lightning it is of the greatest importance to know, if lightning discharges are oscillatory or not, and if oscillatory, whether of high or low frequency. Opinions differ very much about this. Some investigators say, that the lightning is oscillatory and of very high frequency from 500,000 to several millions of cycles per second. Others say, that the lightning is oscillatory, but of a frequency never over 8,000 cycles ; and still others say, that the lightning discharges generally are unidirectional, seldom oscillatory, and if so not of very high frequency. There does not seem to be any doubt, that the lightning is a condenser discharge, and we know, as also pointed out by Mr. Adendorff, that the condition for such a discharge being oscillatory is, that the resistance of the conductor, along which the discharge takes place, must be less than","['Lightning', 'Earth', 'Discharges (electric)', 'High frequency', 'Conductors', 'Wires', 'Solenoids']",[]
"In replying to the discussion on my paper, I shall deal with them in the order in which they occurred In reply to the contribution of Mr. Kirkland I must first thank him for some illuminating remarks on lightning phenomena, although it seems that he is speaking from the American standpoint rather than that of local conditions. He makes two statements to which I must take exception, firstly, the capacity of a sphere is proportional to its radius and not to the square of its radius as he states, and secondly, I cannot agree with him that a lightning- flash one mile in length, is unheard of. He assumes that most discharges occur as an equalisation of potential from point to point in a cloud and not as in the case of a condenser bursting its dielectric. This seems to be the general opinion with American authorities, and I have no doubt he is quoting largely from their views. For instance, in a paper read before the N.E.L.A., June, 1907, by Dr. C. P. Steinmetz, I find the following statement: “Lightning flashes usually occur within thunder clouds and only rarely from cloud to cloud or from cloud to ground. This seems to sum up American opinion on the subject, but I do not agree with it—not for conditions existing in south Africa, at any rate.","['Resistance', 'Lightning', 'Discharges (electric)', 'Oscillators', 'Clouds', 'Wires', 'Production']",[]

"The acquisition of rights by an employer in the inventions of his employees is a topic generally apart from the question of giving the employee-inventors rewards for making the inventions in issue.

Likewise, in the case of the ‘shop right’, a licence has usually been royalty free. In Germany on the other hand a special statute governs the reward to be paid to employee-inventors. Reading Mr Adams' contribution one gains the impression that he would not be averse to the introduction of something similar to this country.

There is however a fundamental difference in that the oil in a transformer performs the dual function of acting as an insulator and as a heat transfer medium.

Sweden pioneered h.v.d.c. transmission, and South Africa, together with Mozambique, now has in operation the Cabora Bassa-Apollo line with the highest dc voltage used so far in the world. The successful operation of this line is very encouraging for the future of h.v.d.c. systems.","['Arresters', 'Surges', 'Switches', 'Circuit breakers', 'Poles and towers', 'Zinc oxide', 'Thyristors']",[]

"Mr Howe suggests that in assessing step and touch voltages consideration should be given to assuming a man's weight to be 50 kg instead of 70 kg. This would obviously lead to lower permissible body currents and consequently the need for more elaborate and expensive earthing arrangements to ensure safety of personnel. Since there arc so many variables involved in calculations of body currents such as skin resistance, tolerance to electric shock, characteristics of crushed stone, soil resistivity and magnitude of fault current, and the typical parameters used for each variable represent the worst possible conditions we feel that the design criteria used are already very conservative. It hardly seems justified therefore to change the design basis to allow for what must surely be considered to be a below-average body weight.","['Inductors', 'Testing', 'Surges', 'Lighting', 'Arresters', 'Shunts (electrical)', 'Resistors']",[]
"I would like to thank Prof Hellawell for his remarks. He, however, seems to be pessimistic about the chances of survival of an electrode system in the final application of this method of beach protection. The eddy current electrode would be the obvious choice in this application as it merely consists of a single cable. Experience with communication submarine-cables show that their main source of damage is from trawling activities and dragging anchors. At a sandy beach they become covered by a few metres of sand which protects them against the destructive action of the breakers. The sand very rarely scours out to the ultimate depth of the cable and even then it is exposed for a short period only. Such deep scouring may lake place at roughly 5 year intervals only.","['Marine animals', 'Electrodes', 'Lead', 'Rocks', 'Pain', 'Corrosion', 'Temperature measurement']",[]

"Mr Jack raises the interesting point, that full use should be made of the properties of the polyimide armature winding insulation and states that the film has reversible properties above 200 °C. Increasing the normal maximum permissible temperature of the armature winding to a figure above 200 °C (BS 173 stipulates 185°C for class H insulation) means in effect an increase in the rating of the motor provided the ratings of the field system and commutator can also be increased. As the traction motors of the classes 6E and 6E1 locomotives already develop tractive efforts close to, and in excess of, the adhesion limits (depending on rail conditions), increasing the rating (and with it the hauled loads) means that more wheelslips will be encountered. However, the suggestion of operating a polyimide-insulated armature winding at normal maximum temperature in excess of 200 °C could result in considerable savings in a new design of traction motor. Regarding the class B bonding varnish used with mica in the insulation of the commutator segments, BS 173 stipulates a temperature rise, measured by thermometer, of 90 °C for commutators. Under test (short-time and continuous) the commutator temperature rises of the classes 6E and 6E1 traction motors were of the order of 65 °C. This leaves a fair reserve.","['Traction motors', 'Rails', 'Windings', 'Insulation', 'Choppers (circuits)', 'Bellows', 'Thyristors']",[]

However, I feel that the mining industry, which tends for very sound reasons to be conservative compared with some other industries in the field of control, should note what is happening in other industries. There is no doubt that the new semiconductor devices described tonight have almost superseded all other devices. In some cases it is because of fashion, but, in general, it is because the advantages in performance are self-evident and the expectation in reliability, although not yet fully proven, is not less than with other devices.","['Lifting equipment', 'Converters', 'Read only memory', 'Position control', 'Magnetic separation', 'Ions', 'Integrated circuit reliability']",[]

A small government department cannot invite engineers in terms of rands and cents; it can only do so in terms of enthusiasm and dedication, and therefore our neighbours in commerce and industry will continue to attract graduates with salaries which are far above our modest means. It is significant, however, that, with graduates who enter the signalling field, resignation to enter some other field is virtually unknown.","['Rails', 'Wheels', 'Switches', 'Steel', 'Insulation life', 'Degradation', 'Contacts']",[]

"I agree with Mr Roberts that it is most unlikely that a tolerable level of PI) related to a given test voltage can be defined and found generally acceptable. His remarks about his experience has shown to be necessary to achieve a background level of 25 pc are most interesting and indicate that a PD test on a large high-voltage transformer is likely to be an expensive operation and therefore can only be contemplated as a development test or possibly a type test. His suggestions for a method of carrying out a PD test are very practical and in general I would agree with them, particularly the stipulation that there should be no measurable increase above the background level which should, I suggest, be specified (say 25 pe). Some discussion took place at the 1968 CIGRE meeting regarding the voltage value for such a test (120 percent or 150 per cent).","['Partial discharges', 'Windings', 'Voltage measurement', 'Discharges (electric)', 'Sea measurements', 'Sea level', 'Power transformer insulation']",[]
"A.W. Richards: To date very little work has been done on the problem of electrical equipment operating in areas where flammable or explosive substances that burn without an external oxygen source are present. The stability range of such materials is extremely wide and because of this it is difficult to prescribe equipment suitable for general use. Ideally, electrical equipment to be used in such areas should be tailored to suit the environment. In certain cases intrinsically safe equipment may be suitable but it must be borne in mind that the ignition energies of many explosive substances are well below those that may be released in most intrinsically safe circuits.","['Monitoring', 'Ions', 'Explosives', 'Atmosphere', 'Flanges', 'Switches', 'Standards']",[]

"First of all Mr Brinkworth asks why magnetic phase shift is used. I have described a well proven circuit which is in current use. Its rate of response is already higher than can be permitted from the point of view of rate of change of current which can be tolerated in machine armature circuits. We are already able to provide transistor control amplifiers for all sizes of phase shifters. The next stage is a semi-conductor type of phase shift circuit. This is developed and will be going into service in the near future. The advantage then will not be so much the fact that still faster phase shift is obtainable but that appreciably more sophisticated methods can be adopted. With very fast phase shift it is possible to dispense altogether with circulating current control on cross-connected rectifiers because immediate transference of current from, say, a rectifying to an inverting anode will be feasible.","['Rectifiers', 'Contactors', 'Generators', 'Traction motors', 'Plugs', 'Fasteners', 'Converters']",[]
"Mr Lindley (in reply): I would like to thank Mr Bishop for his comments on the paper and for raising a number of interesting points. The ‘pebble-bed’ reactor is quite a fascinating theoretical concept but in my view suffers from a number or fundamental technical objections. To be economic a power plant must have an acceptable first cost, a satisfactory efficiency, moderate maintenance costs, and a high ‘availability’ (i.e. out of action only for maintenance, etc., for short periods of time in total per annum). If any of these four criteria is grossly violated then the system proposed is most unlikely to be satisfactory for electric power generation. With a plant of high capital cost it is particularly important that the availability should be high and maintenance costs low. The ‘pebble-bed’ plant with its highly radioactive coolant circuit, boilers, etc., will, I feel sure, show a disappointingly low availability and high maintenance costs. In addition to these problems there are a large number of technical difficulties in the design and control of the reactor which remain to be resolved.","['Inductors', 'Instruments', 'Power generation', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Coal', 'Art', 'Productivity']",[]

"Dr Hewitt asks whether my Company has published any independent data on the values of various types of terrain for producing a back scatter signal, but, as far as I know, they have not. Investigation of this phenomenon has been carried out for a long time and 1 think it is fair to say that investigation of back scatter on microwaves has been going on since the days of the H2S, which was about the earliest of the vertical incidence radar scanners used on aircraft. Since that time there has been quite a lot of work done, much of it by Government Departments or by firms under Government development contracts, and there have not been very many papers published. Of the papers used by my own organization, the first was produced by Wiltshire, Schlesinger and Johnson entitled “Backscattering Characteristics of the Sea” in the region of 10 to 15 000 megacycles”, that is to say from 2 cm to 30 metres. This was published in the “Proceedings of the I.R.E.”, an American Journal, in February 1957. A second paper was published in July, 1959, by Grant and Yattley on “Backscattering from water and land, centrimetric and milimetric wavelengths”, also in the Proceedings of the I.R.E., July, 1957, and J.P.

I feel the stage is being reached where some consideration of solid-state structure and solid-state properties is an essential part of the engineering course, and it would begin to seem also that some study of plasmas is becoming an essential, or a near essential, feature of a course for engineers, particularly for electrical engineers.","['Time-frequency analysis', 'Sun', 'Photovoltaic cells', 'Solar energy', 'Chemicals', 'Surface impedance', 'Solar radiation']",[]

"Dr Posel (in reply): I thank Professor Heymann for the trouble he has taken in preparing his contribution to the discussion. In reply to his statement that a transient analysis of the parallel-T should have been given ab initio and thereafter the steady-state solution should have been extracted from it, I would like to give the following reasons which advocate, in my opinion, the presentation of the steady-state analysis first. The design of the parallel-T will invariably be approached from the viewpoint of the transfer sensitivity under steady-state conditions, and as a result of these considerations certain restrictions can be placed first on the magnitudes of network components and second, certain combinations of components may be grouped together. As an example of the former there is the finding that the value of R 1 should be made equal to that of R 2 , and as an example of the latter there arises the combination of network components which was denoted by “d”. Both of these findings emerged from the steady-state analysis and as a result thereof the transient analysis was given in a form more compact than that occurring if the latter investigation had preceded the former. Furthermore, if a reader wishes to use the parallel-T in the application indicated, and if transient analysis per se happens to be not to his liking, the design is accomplished from steady-state considerations with the assurance that the network behaves itself in the transient operation.","['Transient analysis', 'Sensitivity', 'Vibrations', 'Steady-state', 'Impedance', 'Cathodes', 'Capacitors']",[]

"Mr Brummer has described the germanium and silicon rectifiers developed in the United States of America. In England too, silicon rectifiers are undergoing intensive development and experimental cells have been produced which are capable of operating at a d.c. output of 1 kW and a junction temperature of 200°C. The low reverse current of a silicon rectifier compared with that of a germanium rectifier does not seem to offer any practical advantage except in so far as it enables higher operating temperatures to be used. The reverse current of the germanium rectifier is already so low that it has little effect on the efficiency or heating. The possibility of detecting a failing silicon rectifier by the increase in reverse current is attractive; a method by which this can be done in an equipment having a large number of cells in series and parallel will be quite interesting to develop.","['Rectifiers', 'Germanium', 'Silicon', 'Selenium', 'Resistance', 'Ions', 'Inductors']",[]

Until very recently, when this apparatus was tested in a coal mine, it was not realized that this apparatus would be useful in such geological situations and consequently the apparatus was never designed for operation in these conditions.","['Faces', 'Transistors', 'Microphones', 'Safety', 'Gold', 'Fuel processing industries', 'Silicon']",[]

The complex control systems envisaged in the paper must be very reliable otherwise the delays they cause will more than outweigh the advantages they introduce. To ensure a high degree of reliability and to minimize any downtimes, the availability of good maintenance and operating instructions is essential. Every effort is made to use equipment and schemes which are simple and reliable but nothing is 100 per cent reliable and the more components that there are the more likely it is statistically that there will be a failure. Therefore, the maintenance personnel must be trained and given every facility for instruction. In this direction we agree entirely with the idea of showing the actual build-up and principles employed by the designer in constructing the scheme. Short notes with skeleton diagrams can augment the normal instruction manuals.","['Reliability', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Control systems', 'Training', 'Reliability engineering', 'Generators', 'Personnel']",[]

The authors recognised that this could be the case and seeing that the emphasis was on large motors, all the measurements and experimental work described in this paper were thus carried out on large motors. However, as shown in reference 1 below, measurements were also performed on smaller laboratory machines and after having accounted for the different orders of the parameters, very good agreement was achieved between theory and measurement.","['Vibrations', 'Bars', 'Rotors', 'Induction motors', 'Shafts', 'Frequency measurement', 'Coils']",[]

Meek made the point, with which the authors concur, that the distance of 56 feet assumed for the length of a lightning leader side-flash which would approach a transmission line, might not be accurate. The emphasis on average conditions, perhaps, should have been more accentuated, whereby it would have been appreciated that 50 per cent of strokes having greater than average charges were likely to strike a transmission line from greater distances, and vice versa. The average peak current observed was used, together with assumptions as to the wave form, and critical disruptive gradient for air, to apply Golde's analysis, and the authors believe that these assumptions arc substantially correct, in view of the agreement with other observers over the approximate number of lightning strokes to ground. The calculations should, in any case, provide a greater measure of accuracy than so far achieved in evaluating the comparative performance of transmission lines of differing heights.","['Poles and towers', 'Lightning', 'Ions', 'Discharges (electric)', 'Power transmission lines', 'Transmission line measurements', 'Gold']",[]

"Mr Cheek has raised an extremely interesting point concerning the psychological reactions of most mechanical engineers to electronic control, particularly if this electronic control has invaded a domain previously occupied solely by mechanical devices. The only ultimate answer to this is the relative merit of each device. Does the electronic system perform its job more satisfactorily? Is it cheaper? Is it more reliable? If it does fail, does it fail safe? If, after a period of several years’ operation, the answer to all these questions is ‘yes’, then no reasonable person can really have any objection to the system.","['Brakes', 'Ions', 'Valves', 'Torque', 'Oils', 'Steady-state', 'Regulation']",[]

"The steam turbine governor of James Watt was the first automatic control developed by man. Automatic control is generally understood to mean closed loop control where information is fed around a loop. In the typical automatic control problem the variable to be controlled, called the ‘controlled variable’, is measured. This measurement is compared with a desired or reference value of the controlled variable and the difference or 'error“ is computed. The controller has this system error as its input and on the basis of this error varies the value of the controlling or 'manipulated' variable. This variable is the input to the system to be controlled, the output of the system being the controlled variable. The manipulated variable is varied by the controller so as to keep the controlled variable at or near its desired value. This desired value may be changing according to some schedule.","['Mathematical model', 'Standards', 'Pistons', 'Engines', 'Servomotors', 'Voltage measurement', 'Transient response']",[]
"The reliability of high frequency radio telegraph systems has always been a limitation in international communications. Transmission errors are liable to result from the vagaries of propagation via the ionospheric transmission medium, and from interference. Until recently reliable service for public telegraph traffic has been achieved by high operating standards, with visual inspection of received messages, and correction of errors by repetition on request. This procedure results in poor circuit efficiency, and high operating costs. The demand for international telex and leased circuits in recent years has required the provision of circuits having high transmission accuracy. These demands have given considerable impetus to the development of error correcting telegraph systems. In 1956 at Warsaw the C.C.I.R. recommended the system developed by Doctor H.O.A. van Duuren of the Netherlands for international standardisation. Since that date equipment operating on the van Duuren principle has been installed on most important radio telegraph circuits.","['Standards', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Reliability', 'Redundancy', 'Read only memory', 'Parity check codes', 'Modulation']",[]
"The natural power factor of the electrical distribution system in that fantastic land served by the Oranjemund Power Station is a mere 0.5. There are a variety of good reasons why this figure should be so abysmally low, but the two chief causes are the persistent longevity of some of the old motors with large air gaps, and the necessity of having motors which occasionally, depending on weather conditions, have to operate at full load, but more often loaf.","['Switches', 'Reactive power', 'Power generation', 'Standards', 'Sparks', 'Skeleton', 'Meteorology']",[]
"One of the most important operations in the control of power station plant is that of connecting synchronous machines or a.c. networks in parallel. This operation is generally known as “synchronising“, and can usually be carried out only when the phase position, frequency and voltage of the two systems are as nearly identical as possible. If the respective generating systems have identical voltages and frequencies, the difference between their voltages at any given instant will be zero provided that their phase positions coincide exactly, but if the frequency is not exactly the same a resultant voltage — known as the beat voltage — varying cyclically between a maximum and zero will be produced. The frequency of the beat voltage gives a measure of the frequency difference between the two systems, and is commonly expressed as the “beat period” or time between two successive zero values on the curve. The beat period will increase in length the closer the respective frequencies become. When the phase displacement is zero, the beat voltage will be passing through zero at the same instant, provided that the two system voltages have the same amplitude. The ideal condition therefore for the perfect synchronising of two systems, whose respective frequencies are approximately the same, is that the breaker connecting the two systems closes at the exact moment when the beat voltage (and phase displacement) is zero. For a perfect understanding of all the conditions governing synchronising, it is essential to have very clearly in mind the distinction between frequency, phase position and voltage and how these influence the process of synchronising.","['Generators', 'Frequency synchronization', 'Transient analysis', 'Power generation', 'Current transformers', 'Synchronous machines', 'Limiting']",[]
"The paper tends to discount the lost-call theory of on-demand systems with so-called non-waiting arrangements, as well as the grade of service conception deduced therefrom. In its place an outlook is offered based on an appreciation of traffic theory which provides a set of continuous relationships covering the practical problems produced in any on-demand as well as any trunk-line system. The whole sphere cannot be covered adequately in one paper and for reasons of general interest the paper has been limited in mathematical argument. The basic traffic theory has perforce had to be reviewed to build up the outlook.","['Integrated circuits', 'Telephone sets', 'Delays', 'Registers', 'Time measurement', 'Meters', 'Loading']",[]
"This paper discusses two aspects of testing of the coders and encoders (codecs) and associated circuits in pulse code modulation (pcm) systems. The first is a method of measuring analogue signal parameters such as mean square levels and dc values. The second, considered in broad terms only, is the generation of suitable test signals. The two techniques are discussed in the context of automatic testing of pcm systems. Pulse code modulation was initially introduced into public telephone networks to increase the capacity of existing inter-exchange connections in densely populated areas. The emergence of fully electronic exchanges using pcm to produce digital signals for switching is responsible for an increase in the number of codecs in use. Future trends towards digital subscriber loops will result in a very large number of codecs situated away from the exchange plant. The need for automatic testing of systems containing pcm codecs will thus increase in future.","['Codecs', 'Phase change materials', 'Distortion measurement', 'Measurement uncertainty', 'Decoding', 'Test equipment', 'Signal generators']",[]

Each class is defined by different resource and performance requirements, characterized by different bit rates on the uplink and downlink, and different QoS parameters. The CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) multiple access scheme is used and a mobility model is adopted to represent the relative motion of mobile terminals over the satellite spot beams. We investigate the blocking behavior of each traffic class in the network and consider the impact of sub-optimal re-distribution of band resources between the uplink and downlink.

These methods vary according to their treatment of the uncertainty associated with forecast loads. The calculation algorithms are frequently concealed in sophisticated computer packages where output accuracy is often taken for granted.

"Load data collected in the national load research project in South Africa has shown that residential loads can be modelled as Beta probability distributions, but it has not been evident what Beta parameters should be used. This paper presents a technique for analysing the data to identify the parameters which can best represent the loads and describes how the parameters may be derived from the collected data. Among other things, it is shown that the worst condition for the voltage drop on a radial feeder supplying a finite number of customers depends on both the system demand and the (statistical) variance between the customers, and may not occur at the time of system maximum demand. The selection of Beta parameters for the load model can be associated with the risk that the target voltage drop will be exceeded, linking the load model directly to quality of supply criteria. The techniques can be applied in any country to derive locally appropriate load parameters.","['Load modeling', 'Circuit breakers', 'Dispersion', 'Limiting', 'Current measurement', 'Standards', 'Probability distribution']","['Electrification', 'domestic customers', 'load models', 'beta distribution']"

"The vast majority of steam generating plants have to deal with steam-using equipment, the demand of which varies from hour to hour, minute to minute, or even from second to second. The transference of the steam demand, unaltered, to the steam generating section of the plant imposes a duty on the latter which is frequently very severe, and which seldom permits of the boilers operating at their best efficiency, not to mention the strain placed on the operating staff in many instances. The desirability of approximating as closely as possible to constant-firing conditions, maintained over longish periods of time, is almost self-evident, and this is the object aimed at in what I have termed Boiler-house Load Equalisation.","['Boilers', 'Firing', 'Combustion', 'Economics', 'Lifting equipment', 'Fluctuations', 'Coal']",[]

The book is very well illustrated, and this adds considerably to its enjoyment. Beginning with fuel from coal, Dr Allibone traces the history of important nuclear discoveries from Dalton and Faraday. A chapter is devoted to the atom and another to the nucleus. Several interesting experiments at the lectures are described and they enrich ones understanding of the subject. Next fission of uranium, nuclear power stations, the production and uses of isotopes, and power from fusion are dealt with.

The design and dimensions of cast and tubular sockets have not been altered as compared with the previous edition of the specification, but an important modification has been made in that hot-pressed sockets are now recognised as standard, whereas formerly cast sockets and tubular sockets were the only types recognised as standard. The material for the manufacture of hot-pressed sockets is specified, as are also the dimensions. A useful feature of the revised specification is the insertion of tables giving the approximate current (at the Institute Electrical Engineer's rating) of the largest conductor for which the different sizes of socket is suitable. A new appendix has been added to the specification, giving the International Standards of resistance for copper.","['Standards', 'Sockets', 'Batteries', 'Metals', 'Wires', 'Fans', 'Electron tubes']",[]

"Broadcasting is a technology based industry which is developing fitter than most industries. The present surge of technological change in broadcasting is based on the transistor and its microelectronic derivatives, integrated circuits and semiconductor stores In particular. The transistor and its derivatives have also made computers practical Broadcasting engineers have applied computer technology to broadcasting and as a result more and more signals are being handled in digital form. Transistor technology makes equipment smaller, lighter, cheaper and more reliable. Digital technology makes signal storage, processing and distribution easier white maintaining the original quality unimpaired. The paper discusses how these developments are likely to affect broadcasting and its reception in the 1980s.","['TV', 'Standards', 'Broadcasting', 'Encoding', 'Bit rate', 'Power capacitors', 'Image color analysis']",[]

Columnar Scanning is presented here as an alternative to Raster Scanning. Columnar Scanning has been found by the author to provide significant improvements on data compression ratios over Raster Scanning. This improvement is limited to data compression methods which use the relationships between adjacent data in the uncompressed source data; ie methods such as run-length-coding [1] and Lempel-Ziv-Welch coding [2]. It does not improve on such data-sequence-independent methods such as Huffman coding [3]. Columnar Scanning is completely lossless, it does not alter the image data in any way, but makes it more useful to a data compression method. Attention is given to how it improves the data compression of a small black and white image (512×256 pixels).","['Image coding', 'Streaming media', 'Probability', 'Image color analysis', 'Huffman coding', 'Electrical engineering', 'Testing']",[]

"The interaction of the measurements of cost centres and profit centres, and the resultant effect on an organization's profit is examined by applying the Theory of Constraints thinking processes. Two cases are described based on the measurements that a profit centre should maximize profit and a cost centre should at least recover its costs. These cases illustrate that some outsourcing decisions taken in isolation can lead to a spiral of declining competitiveness; and that the attempts by a cost centre to maximize cost recovery leads to a lower profit for the organization. The thinking process logic shows that these negative effects are caused by the application of wrong measurement criteria.","['Organizations', 'Investment', 'Outsourcing', 'Tariffs', 'Spirals', 'Costing', 'Productivity']",[]

"The magnitude of the problem of handling constantly increasing traffic necessitates straight thinking years before the projects mature. The progress that is being made to-day is due to the correctness of decisions made by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and engineers abroad as far back as 1936. This advance planning must go on as a continuous process—at least until there are some indications of satura tion—a state of, affairs which no tele communications man has ever yet exper ienced. Hence, this paper does, I think, afford a timely opportunity to consider briefly the possible trend of future activities. So far as open-wire routes are concerned, it would appear that the conventional type of construction prevents exploitation at frequencies above 150 kilocycles per second, certainly with the equipment that is at present available. Such a route and systems can provide approximately 130 telephone channels between primary centres. Present plans envisage, say, forty tele phone channels between Johannesburg and Bloemfontein and Johannesburg to Pietermaritzburg. It is my own opinion that within a few years certain primary centres may require more than 130 telephone channels linking them. How could this need be met by using systems which are at present developed.","['Wires', 'Telephone sets', 'Planning', 'Coaxial cables', 'Resistors', 'Repeaters', 'Multiplexing']",[]

"Zero voltage switching in resonant inverters has proven itself as an effective way to minimize the switching losses present in high frequency inverters. The resonant pole inverter has lately been identified as a suitable inverter for larger power levels. Switching times are not directly related to switching losses as in the case for hard switching - a fact which can be used to advantage when selecting devices. On the other hand, larger than 1 p.u. peak device current stresses are present which requires overdimensioning of the switches and could give rise to larger conduction losses in the semiconductor devices. The resonant pole inverter requires an additional inductor which further contributes to losses. In this paper the losses are modelled and the trade-off between the different loss components and suitability of device types are investigated using the hard switched inverter as reference. An important conclusion is that semiconductor power devices need to be designed differently for soft switching application, with more emphasis on reduction of conduction losses.","['Switches', 'Resonant inverters', 'Inductors', 'Switching loss', 'Semiconductor diodes', 'Capacitors', 'Stress']",[]

A comparison between Zadoff Chu (ZC), Oppermann & Vucetic (OV), and Constant-Envelope Root-of-Unity (CE-RU) filtered Generalized-Chirp-Like (GCL) sequences is presented including the special class of Analytical Bandlimited Complex (ABC) spreading sequences. This comparison is based on aperiodic correlation characteristics rather than traditionally discussed parameters like periodic, even, and odd correlations and the emphasis is based on practical considerations rather than rigorous mathematical derivation as found in the most of the literature. This paper is unique in the sense that it also presents the effect of filtering on polyphase sequences by using proper filtering methods. The said classes of the sequences are filtered by using a Nyquist filter, and a Constant Envelope Root-of-Unity (CE-RU) filtering process. It is shown that RU filter performance is better than that of Nyquist filter and also provides a substantial processing gain over Nyqiust filtered sequences. This paper also examines the performance of three classes of sequences using the criterion of mean square values of aperiodic cross-correlation.","['Correlation', 'Filtering', 'Phase change materials', 'Bandwidth', 'Bit error rate', 'Gold', 'Frequency modulation']","['Generalised-Chirp-Like (GCL)', 'Aperiodic Auto Correlation (AAC)', 'Aperiodic Cross-Correlation (ACC)', 'Constant-Envelope Root-of-Unity (CE-RU)', 'Root-of-Unity (RU)', 'Analytical Bandlimited Complex (ABC)', 'Zadoff-Chu (ZC)', 'Oppermann & Vucetic (OV)', 'Processing Gain (PG)', 'Mean-Sqaure Aulo-Correlation (MSAC)', 'Mean-Square Cross-Correlation (MSCC)', 'Power Correlation Margin (PCM)', 'Constant-Envelope Root-of-Unity filtered Double Side Band (CE-RU DSB)', 'Single Side Band (SSB)', 'Multi-User-Interference (MUI)', 'Bit Error Rate (BER)']"

"It is generally accepted that the type of control obtainable with the Ward-Leonard drive is the most suitable for mine winder operation and all developments on other electrical drives for winder have striven to achieve a similar control. There are, however, a number of other factors which affect the decision on the type of drive to use on any particular installation. The most important of these, viz power consumption, voltage regulation, maximum demand, capital cost, heat dissipation and harmonics, are considered in the paper and a comparison is made between Ward-Leonard, rectifier and a.c. drives in relation to these factors. For many years, open-loop control of winders has provided adequate control characteristics but the more stringent operational requirements for modern electric winders have resulted in the development of closed-loop control systems. Two such systems, one for a Ward-Leonard drive and the other for a rectifier drive, are described and the arrangements for obtaining automatic retardation of the winder as the conveyances approach the terminal points of the shaft are discussed. Operational results obtained on winders employing these systems arc given and attention is given to the means for stopping the winder in emergencies. It is concluded that the results obtained with the closed loop Ward-Leonard system are sufficiently accurate to meet present requirements but that some improvement is still desirable on the rectifier winder. Future developments would, therefore, appear to be aimed mainly at the application of new techniques to achieve similar results.","['Windings', 'Reactive power', 'Voltage control', 'Power demand', 'Shafts', 'Rectifiers', 'Induction motors']",[]

"This work considers the performance of Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum Multiple Access (DS/SSMA) transmission with space- and time diversity for the uplink of a cellular Indoor Wireless Communication (IWC) channel. Due to fading associated with the IWC channel and the asynchronous arrival of the received signals a coherent reference is difficult to obtain and hence Differential Phase Shift Keying(DPSK) is assumed as modulation scheme. The indoor communication channel, which is multipath faded, is modeled by a discrete set of Nakagami faded paths which has been shown to fit empirical data of the IWC channel better than other distributions [1]. Instead of using the commonly assumed Gaussian Assumption to describe the Inter User Interference (IUI), the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method [2] is used to infer the IUI distribution accurately [3]. The average error rate and capacity of a DS/SSMA system under typical IWC channel conditions is therefore accurately calculated using the IUI distribution obtained by the MaxEnt method. Numerical results reveal that for non-diversity receivers, Nakagami fading is very hostile to the SSMA signal. However, using space diversity with Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) and time diversity (in the form of convolutional coding) at the base station, the average error rate can be reduced dramatically, allowing for reliable communication.","['Nakagami distribution', 'Diversity reception', 'Receivers', 'Differential phase shift keying', 'Transmitters', 'Time division multiple access', 'Rayleigh channels']","['Spread Spectrum', 'Error Control Coding']"

In order to assemble the many factors involved in a reasonably logical sequence, the various sections of the paper follow, generally, in the same order as the chronological process of analysis, design, engineering, testing and finally proving a high-voltage system. No attempt has been made to deal with the equally important subjects of the specification, testing, construction, inspection and testing of plant, although it will be readily appreciated that modern systems designed for high circuit loadings are made possible only by the use of the best equipment available.","['Insulation', 'System analysis and design', 'Switches', 'Shunts (electrical)', 'Rail transportation', 'Loading', 'Inductors']",[]

Strain gauges are attached to the ankle and interfaced to a PC via the games (joystick) port where ankle movement is used to control any number of joystick games and applications, thereby providing a motivational means of exercise and rehabilitation. A flexible diagnostic tool, for assessing the condition and rehabilitation of a patient, was developed.

"AUTHOR'S REPLY TO DISCUSSION Replying to Mr C. Ryder, generators controlled by the latest type of automatic voltage regulator, which has no ‘dead band’ and a high speed of response to voltage, load, and power-factor changes, can be operated much closer to the stability limit than is possible when they are controlled by the older vibrating contact type regulators. This should make it possible to use generators with lower short-circuit ratios than were previously required to deal with leading load conditions.","['Generators', 'Rotors', 'Regulators', 'Stator cores', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Voltage control', 'Hydrogen']",[]
"Summary The paper deals with some of the problems encountered in the design of the larger turbo-type a.c. generators which were built during the last 15 years, and those under construction at present. The main problem is to produce reliable, efficient machines with long life and requiring the minimum maintenance, at an economic price, and of weight and dimensions which are within the available transport limits. In many cases the latter item presents the greatest difficulty because it conflicts with the other main requirements. It is regretted that in many countries transport facilities have not kept pace with the demands of the times. Basically a turbo-generator consists of a stator, with its frame, core, and insulated windings, a solid steel rotor with its insulated windings and means for removing the heat losses from these parts. Most of the new problems encountered have been concerned with conditions which have arisen due to the increased capacity of units and the introduction of hydrogen cooling.","['Stator cores', 'Steel', 'Windings', 'Stator windings', 'Generators', 'Rotors', 'Magnetic cores']",[]
"This paper presents the design of a turbo encoding scheme with embedded Walsh-Hadamard (WH) codewords, and a suitable decoder structure based on an iterative decoding technique, akin to the work on “superorthogonal” turbo codes presented by Pehkonen and Komulainen. The main contributions of this paper are a detailed design of the turbo decoder structure required to perform the required decoding steps, and theoretical analysis to provide upper bounds on bit error rate performance. Attention is focused on an 8-state rate 2/64 coded QPSK DS/CDMA system, in agreement with the rate offered by the IS-95 coding scheme. The bit error rate performance of the proposed iterative turbo coded DS/CDMA system operating on the AWGN channel is studied by means of simulation and compared to that of a DS/CDMA system employing the IS-95 front-end coder for the reverse link channel. Both single and multi-user system performance are considered.","['Encoding', 'Decoding', 'Phase shift keying', 'Iterative decoding', 'Turbo codes', 'TV', 'Reliability']","['Concatenated Coding', 'Soft-Input Soft-Output Decoding Algorithms', 'Iterative Decoding', 'Code-Division Multiple Access']"
"The finite element method is used to design an etched microstrip balun for transforming a 100 ohm balanced impedance to a 50 ohm unbalanced coaxial cable. Design curves for determining the required impedances along the balun are presented. An etched balun was incorporated into a planar Archimedes spiral antenna and the performance of this antenna is compared to that of a second spiral antenna fed by a tapered coaxial line balun. Examination of the VSWR, patterns, axial ratio, squint and gain shows that the performance of the two baluns is equivalent with the etched balun having superior squint properties.","['Baluns', 'Spirals', 'Finite element analysis', 'Antenna measurements', 'Microstrip', 'Antennas', 'Transmission line measurements']","['Balun', 'Finite Element Method', 'Spiral Antennas']"

"Given a control problem, informations (e.g., measurements) of the state gathered along time are described by a informational tube. The detector associates with any current time the (possibly empty) subset of states that can be reached by a evolution from the initial time up to the current time “detectable” in the sense it satisfies the given measurements. Once defined, this detector is characterized and studied with the tools of viability theory.

"Conceptually, a broken rotor bar in a squirrel cage induction motor would imply an open circuit in one of the bars. On the contrary, research [1] has shown that in most, copper cage motors, the contact impedance between bar and core is small, allowing current to continue to flow into the broken bar. This current enters the broken bar, and flows through the core to the adjacent healthy bars, as interbar currents. The paper shows that these interbar currents produce an axial force, and by monitoring the associated frequencies - interbar current and consequently broken rotor bars are detected at an early stage of development such as a high resistance joint (bar-end ring joints) or one broken bar. Experimental measurements in part II of the paper verify the theory presented in this paper.","['Bars', 'Rotors', 'Stator windings', 'Amplitude modulation', 'Stator cores', 'Copper', 'Monitoring']","['Squirrel cage induction motors', 'broken rotor bars', 'interbar currents', 'condition monitoring', 'preventative maintenance']"
"Experimental measurements on three squirrel cage induction motors are presented to verify the theory developed in part I of this paper. The axial vibration and stator current spectra were measured on all three motors. The first is a 55kW motor having large interbar currents, while the remaining motors are two, identical 75kW motors, one with a broken bar (having small interbar currents) and one with a healthy cage. A comparison between the axial vibration and stator current measurements are made, showing that while the stator current technique uses the magnetic disturbance to detect the fault, the axial vibration technique relies directly on the interbar currents present in the motor. As interbar currents are present in the initial stages of the fault, early detection of broken rotor bars can be achieved by monitoring the axial vibration. This correlates with the theory presented in part I of the paper.","['Bars', 'Vibrations', 'Frequency modulation', 'Rotors', 'Amplitude modulation', 'Force', 'Stator windings']","['Squirrel cage induction motors', 'broken rotor bars', 'interbar currents', 'condition monitoring', 'preventative maintenance']"

"The expression ‘dc transmission’ is an all-embracing term with many facets, including power system engineering, converter stations design, special equipment design, and like all engineering it is greatly influenced by economics. In essence, a dc transmission scheme will draw its power from some ac source — either directly from generators or alternatively from a power system which in itself can have varying degrees of complexity — and after rectification, transmission and inversion feed the power into another ac system, again of varying complexity, or into another part of the same system. The dc transmission system has to be assessed in terms of economics and reliability compared with alternative ac methods of transmission.","['Valves', 'Ions', 'Urban areas', 'Rivers', 'Bridge circuits', 'Surges', 'Feeds']",[]

A model of the Rogowski coil and the associated passive integrator circuit is presented and a technique for designing a Rogowski coil for a given application is described.

These are used to obtain the number of turns on the coil and the values of the passive integrator resistor and capacitor required. The implications of these specifications on the voltage stress applied to the coil is also discussed.

"A charge controlled model of the transistor in the active region is defined by a non-linear differential equation which expresses the base current in terms of the charges in the active base region and in the two depletion regions. The parameters associated with the differential equation were determined by a set of small signal a.c. measurements covering the active region of the transistor. Integration with respect to time of the equation mentioned above yields the total charge which must be delivered by the base current in order to change the quiescent point of the transistor, and also shows the distribution of this charge in four components, viz. Q a the charge added to the active base region, Q r the charge lost through recombination and Q tc and Q te the charges necessary to change the voltages across the depletion regions. Calculated values of these charges (for a specific change in operating point) were verified experimentally by means of a pulse test proposed by Sparkes3. Two transistors were considered, viz. a planar diffused Si switching transistor (BSY 25) and an alloy junction Ge transistor (OC 44). Good agreement between calculated values and pulse measurements was obtained for the BSY 25. The poorer agreement obtained in the case of the OC 44 is attributed to the fact that the construction of these transistors is such that charges can be stored in the base material in regions relatively far from the active base region immediately between the two junctions; as shown by Verster 4 a more complete charge controlled model is necessary to describe the operation of such transistors.","['Transistors', 'RNA', 'Gold', 'Switching circuits', 'Slag', 'Rail to rail outputs', 'Mathematical model']",[]

This is limited to classical areas of processing in the time or frequency domain using Fourier transformations, spectral analysis, filtering, correlation of convulation. Prior to the introduction of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), digital signal processing in engineering applications was limited mainly to time domain solutions. The FFT opened up the whole field of frequency domain processing for digital techniques. This in turn stimulated the development of new algorithms or methods for solving of problems which in the put were not possible with analogue techniques. After a brief review of early developments and means for information reduction, the FFT, the chirp Z-transform, the Cepstrum, Fast Number Transform, linear prediction and adaptive filtering, are discussed.","['Program processors', 'Frequency-domain analysis', 'Signal processing', 'Fast Fourier transforms', 'Time-domain analysis', 'Correlation', 'Spectral analysis']",[]

"Over the past few years, digital computers have played an ever-increasing role in the field of process control, in a supervising as well as a direct controlling capacity. Direct digital control applications have not been common in electrical engineering applications, owing to the fast sampling rates required. The use of minicomputers specifically for direct digital control purposes may well change this situation, particularly as the cycle time and price of such computers is decreased. This paper describes an actual example of the use of a minicomputer to effect the speed control of a separately excited dc machine. Digital data input and output facilities were used, with a hard-wired interface to effect the phase control of a thyristor bridge, and a digital tachometer. The system was analysed using z-transform methods, and a degree of compensation, based on the sampled-data nature of the system, introduced. The algorithms developed were found to be economical of computer time, because of the use of the hard-wired interface. Two machines were controlled on a time-sharing basis, indicating that this type of application could be considerably extended to use one computer to perform a number of control functions.","['Thyristors', 'Control systems', 'Digital computers', 'Transfer functions', 'Voltage measurement', 'Digital control', 'Computational modeling']",[]

He has traced back the historical background of electrical engineering from its very beginning, in a way that I, personally, have never heard done before. It makes us realise, I think, that the beginnings from which our profession comes had their roots very far back, and that the light and heavy current men have intermingled their roots and branches right through the picture. I think, the inauguration of this light current section to-night has opened a new chapter in the work of this Institute.","['Wireless communication', 'Broadcasting', 'Electrical engineering', 'Shafts', 'History', 'Valves', 'Roads']",[]

"The President : About two years ago, one of our assistant engineers experienced a rather disturbing occurrence. He reported that he had been travelling in a cage when the hoist tripped out. Although the hoist had been travelling relatively slowly, the decleration was such that he was thrown on to the floor of the cage. We studied the winder circuits and the braking system but could not find a suitable explanation. We, therefore, borrowed from our friends of the Goldfields their Cambridge decelerometer, and tried to reproduce these conditions. One of the authors and two other officials got into the cage with the Cambridge decelerometer ; they were travelling at a relatively slow speed and, after two or three tests, which were quite innocuous, the driver did something which reproduced the original conditions. The author was thrown on the floor, and the other two passengers fell on top of him. After that, it was decided that engineers, in spite of popular opinion, are not expendable, and that steps must be taken to find an instrument suitable for doing in safety the routine and experimental tests which are required to prove what hoists will do under all circumstances. The result of these decisions is the instrument you have seen demonstrated to-night.","['Ions', 'Stress', 'Safety', 'Oscillators', 'Lifting equipment', 'Windings', 'Vibrations']",[]

"THE PRESIDENT : We believe that over the years many frills have been added unnecessarily to the electrical systems of winders. This stemmed largely from the selling set-up wherein the large firms supplying electrical equipment had close financial arrangements on tendering. Once there was no financial competition the rivals competed by the inclusion of frills. As an example there were prior to the war, many and various controlled electrical braking systems. These have exercised our ingenuity over the years in devising how to get rid of them. Amongst the frills, however, there have been many sound advances in the art which have proved their worth. I suppose we must countenance the inclusion of frills otherwise we should not achieve the advances, the difficulty is to assess whether an innovation is an advance or a frill. In many cases practical experience only can determine this.","['Lifting equipment', 'Rotors', 'Resistance', 'Torque', 'Stators', 'Rocks', 'Generators']",[]

"T. Harvey: The film which Mr Symes has shown probably shows up more clearly than any verbal description the outstanding ease of control of the differential locomotive. The most convincing experience of all, however, is actually to drive the loco as a number of people have already done. Being privileged to assist Mr Symes in the long series of tests which were carried out I have been able to observe the reactions of these visitors. Invariably the pattern was the same; an extremely sceptical outlook when first told about the loco and what it could do; a smile of contempt when they first saw the strange contraption in its shed; and finally overwhelming enthusiasm when they had put it through its paces. The treatment it received was unmerciful — and we encouraged visitors to try the most vicious driving tricks they could think up. I have lost count of the number of times the controller was thrown from full speed forward to full speed reverse while the loco was pulling its maximum load — often on a downgrade at that. The fact that the experimental loco is still running without any need of an overhaul is more revealing as regards its inherent ruggedness than all the theory in the world. I hope that the prototype and production locos will never be driven the way the experimental loco has been, but if they are they will take it in their stride.","['Torque', 'Shafts', 'Resistance', 'Power generation', 'Couplings', 'Companies', 'Windings']",[]

GILLETT (Member) : From an academical point of view, Mr Hunter's paper has several interesting features ; as a serious contribution to the methods suitable for getting us out of our difficulties with regard to power shortages, I find it singularly unsatisfying. The most glaring omission, of course, is the amazing lack of figures or curves to show why centralized load control should ever be resorted to. If it is decided to instal such a system, how much is it going to cost for capital and maintenance charges, and what benefit is it going to be ? There is nothing in this paper to induce a hard-pressed municipal electrical engineer to coax a large sum of money from his Council to purchase such a load-control device ; I am given to understand that for a moderately sized town, an injector costs about 7 000 and each relay about 5 plus the erection and maintenance charges, but I contend that the actual savings to be effected are ephemeral.","['Substations', 'Relays', 'Load flow control', 'Water heating', 'Voltage control', 'Valves', 'Transient analysis']",[]

It has been pointed out in Mr Raynham's contribution that the problem of closing overvoltages attains more significance with increase of rated voltage. In the case of a single-phase fault followed up by three phase auto-reclosure it may happen that at the instant of closing of the healthy phases an inverse polarity will prevail between the voltages on the line and supply sides of the circuit breaker. With respect to the magnitudes of closing overvoltages this closing operation at inverse polarity yields substantially less favourable results than that of switohing-on to a de-energised line. It is therefore primarily a task of attributing this switching case to closing on to a de-energrised line.,"['Inductors', 'Surges', 'Phase transformers', 'Shunts (electrical)', 'Power transformers', 'Lightning', 'Circuit faults']",[]

"It is agreed that rigid specifications in directions other than performance often inadvertently favour one design while ruling out consideration of another fundamentally capable of giving equal or better service. The most detailed design and material specification cannot cover all the little items which go to make sound design and reliable manufacture. For example, some years ago a particular transformer would not stand up to the impulse level the designer believed he had built into it. Briefly, all that was necessary to make the transformer behave satisfactorily was an apparently insignificant modification to the layout of the tapping-switch leads.","['Power transformer insulation', 'Standards', 'Insulation', 'Surges', 'Windings', 'Iron', 'Regulators']",[]

"In the United States and Scandinavia distribution transformers are routine impulse tested which, in addition to proving that the transformers are capable of withstanding the surge levels, serves also as a check of workmanship. We are far from reaching this stage in this country but more regular impulse testing, e.g. batch testing, as mentioned in one paper, may have to be considered for large orders of distribution transformers in this country when adequate impulse testing facilities are available. One author suggests that impulse testing might replace what he calls ‘the onerous induced-voltage test’ which seems to presuppose that this test is more severe than the impulse test. This viewpoint is not entirely shared and I think that it is true to say that for disc-coil designs, at least, the impulse test is more onerous.","['Standards', 'Power transformer insulation', 'Oil insulation', 'Impulse testing', 'Dispersion', 'Voltage control', 'Regulation']",[]

"(Member): Section 4.3.4 of the paper deals with the use of series capacitors on high-voltage transmission lines and I would like to refer to a protection problem which these introduce. This problem arises with distance protection which is, of course, widely applied on high-voltage circuits. As stated in the paper, a series capacitor is usually fitted with a shunt spark gap which is set to flashover and thereby short circuit the capacitor at a current of 2 to 3 times full-load current. It follows that the series capacitor is, or is not, in circuit according to whether or not the spark gap is flashed over, i.e. according to the magnitude of the fault current. This means that the impedance seen by the relays can lose its proportionality of distance and also that the phase angle of the fault current may vary over a wide range. The value of the capacitance used varies according to requirements but it may be of the order of 50 per cent on the line inductance. The position and number of series capacitors used in a line may also vary.

"P. Machanik : The art of telecommunications, now about 100 years old, was initially based on the transmission of pulses over single-wire lines. The intervening period has witnessed some remarkable results. Development has crowded on development and it has needed sound judgment to determine which systems of communication should be introduced because of the fear that in a few years they would be replaced by some new discovery. The original discoveries utilized simple techniques but successive developments became more and more complex and required staff of higher intelligence and training. The first telephones and exchanges installed in South Africa were crude affairs judged by modern standards, just as the first motor-car — the horseless carriage — looks strange against the high-powered streamlined vehicle of to-day. In the urgencies of the present moment we perhaps fail to realize how hard the struggle was to set out a policy in order to give the Union a modern and dependable system of communication. The engineers of an earlier generation than mine were beset by conflicting claims by the sponsors of many systems and had to make difficult decisions. We would be false to our profession if we believed that modern telecommunication practices have crystallized in their present form and that great changes are not in the offing. These changes will affect us to a greater extent than in the past when we had a relatively small plant. Within a few years' time we shall have half a million telephones in use and it will not be such a simple matter to alter our methods. Hence it behoves all of us who have entered this interesting electrical field to be ever-vigilant and far-sighted and it is ever increasingly necessary for the Department to follow up this desire by providing a sound laboratory system.","['Telephone sets', 'Instruments', 'Ear', 'Rail transportation', 'Harmonic analysis', 'Receivers', 'Companies']",[]

"Major G. A. Harvey : We in aviation circles, who are responsible for the provision and engineering of communication circuits and navigational aid facilities, have a requirement for the recording of air/ground radio-telephone transmissions. This requirement has several features which are peculiar, due to the circumstance under which we operate and consequently differs in many ways from the broadcasting aspect outlined by Mr Middleton. The necessity for recording these air/ground transmissions is due to the fact that the post-war trend in aviation communications between the aircraft and ground stations is to use radio telephone in place of manual morse continous wave telegraphy. In the latter case a longhand log record is kept of all messages. Thus in the case of an inquiry into say an accident complete records are available with legal standing. In the ease of radio telephony if the higher speed-message capabilities of the system are to be realised normal longhand methods of message recording are impossible. Hence some form of automatic recording is an essential requirement. For legal reasons the present longhand records are retained for 90 days and then destroyed. It is thus easy to see that a recording system with erasing facilities is particularly attractive, from the point of view of cutting down recurring expenditure. After 90 days the impression on the tape can be erased and the tape re-used.","['Magnetic recording', 'Broadcasting', 'Magnetic heads', 'Telephone sets', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Law', 'Magnetoacoustic effects']",[]

"L. E. Thompson : The question of ageing of rectifiers has arisen in Mr Good-yer's paper and in the discussion. Since the introduction of the selenium rectifier, the use of the copper-oxide rectifier has been restricted largely to modulators and demodulators, and to moving-coil instruments for a.c. measurement. In both these applications a change in the rectifier characteristics will be serious. Modern copper-oxide rectifiers for, these applications, made by improved processes, are artificially aged during production so their characteristics are stable and no subsequent ageing is to be expected.","['Rectifiers', 'Circuit faults', 'Aging', 'Selenium', 'Coils', 'Relays', 'Temperature measurement']",[]

Impulse testing of transformers is, like many other recent subjects of electric power research, accessible to the equipment and the material available only in the biggest of industrial laboratories and undertakings. This is in striking contrast to the light current field, where a laboratory arrangement comprising comparatively cheap and simple equipment may have equal scientific and technical importance as a heavy current set-up costing many thousands of pounds. Perhaps it is this remoteness of the battlefield of heavy current progress which causes students in electrical engineering to follow the lure of the light current side to such an extent that some overseas power undertakings complain of being starved out of the rising generation of engineers.","['Voltage measurement', 'Windings', 'Testing', 'Surges', 'Impulse testing', 'Surge protection', 'Oils']",[]

"The paper presents a method of analysing induction motor dynamic behaviour in a multimotor system. This investigation, unlike previous ones, represents the motors as well as the distribution network elements in terms of their two-axis equations in order to illustrate the effect of using different mathematical models for the motors especially when they are supplied by series capacitor compensated feeders. The results show that the simplified models of the motors do not ‘fail-to-safety’, and that conclusions drawn from a single-machine-infinite-busbar investigation are not necessarily applicable to a multimotor system. A computer program has been developed which allows the user to simply specify the network topology, loads, motors and motor busbars of the system together with the location of any one of four possible disturbances. The program then automatically configures the network, sets up all the equations, carries out a load flow solution for steady initial conditions, and calculates the transient response. The size of the multimotor system to be investigated is limited only by the size and accuracy of the computer.","['Induction motors', 'Mathematical model', 'Synchronous motors', 'Capacitors', 'Rotors', 'Stators', 'Torque']",[]

"The paper attempts to explode the myth that a cheaper relay is the most economical since the overall cost of the relay, engineering and other incidental expenses must be considered. The most economical scheme may well be the one where the more expensive biased relay is used instead of the less expensive unbiased relay. The biased relay should be preferred as long as it is of simple construction and avoids complicated circuits with a multiplicity of contacts. Its high-speed feature, due to inherent stability, affords bettor protection. Engineering time and, therefore, money is saved if calculations can be positive and reliable in the first instance so that finality can be reached immediately without the need for any special proving tests. Standardization of relay elements, cases, etc., can help to reduce maintenance time since this avoids a wide knowledge of many different types of movement. The ease of testing is discussed in relation to special test facilities.

"Lieut.-Col. Dobson (Member): Mr. Bernard Price's paper contains an enormous amount of statistical information and interesting conclusions as a result of his experience on what may be regarded as a pioneer scheme of high voltage transmission of power generated on a large scale. Mr. Price and his staff have brought a wealth of information to the technical societies of the Witwatersrand, and they are to be sincerely congratulated in having overcome the enormous initial difficulties which are inherent to the inception of a large power scheme and in the elimination of most of the disastrous effects which accompany the characteristically severe lightning storms of the Witwatersrand. The attention given to the minutest details of organisation forms excellent reading, and no doubt has had a great effect on the achievement of satisfactory running of the system. In the words of the author, the paper reviews the scheme as a complete entity, it being pointed out that it would be impossible in a single paper to deal with the characteristics and behaviour of each individual class of apparatus. For this reason it is difficult to find points upon which comment or criticism is possible. As a result of reading the paper, and with the object of drawing further from the author's wealth of valuable' information, I would like to ask a few questions.","['Lightning', 'Earth', 'Synchronous motors', 'Arresters', 'Safety', 'Rotors', 'Insulators']",[]

"(Associate Member): Mr. Price, on page 6, discusses the considerations which led to the location of the generating stations. There are not many suitable sites on or near the Witwatersrand for large generating stations, and hence there is little choice in the matter. The distribution of generating plant here, however, probably calls for more forethought than is the case when the power company is called upon to supply a purely, industrial area. The gold mines comprise nearly the whole of the power company's consumers, and the gold mining industry, is, as we all know, more speculative in its nature than what are known as industrial concerns. There is always a termination to the operations of a mine, and although there is no doubt that the mining industry will continue and even increase on the Witwatersrand for a good many years, the areas of greatest demand for energy will change. This being the case, what is now an ideal distribution of generating plant on the Witwatersrand may not be so favourable in a few years time. I do not suppose, for instance, that at the inception of the V.F.P. scheme the engineers could form any reliable opinion of the developments which we now know will take place on the eastern end of the Witwatersrand. For this reason, it is perhaps unfair to criticise the location of the stations and lay-out of the system. Mr. Price gives us the considerations which led to the selection of Vereeniging for the site of a generating station. Viewed from the standpoint which we now have, would it not have been better to have concentrated a much greater proportion of the plant on this site than is the case now ? As the centre of gravity of the load travels eastward, transmission losses with the present lay-out of the system will increase, and it is interesting to note that the furthest east consumer is very little further away from Simmerpan than it is from Vereeniging. Later on, again assuming that the present lay-out is permanent, the losses in transmitting power from Rosherville to where it is required will probably be as great as if it were transmitted direct from Vereeniging, where the cost of coal is less. It is true that as we get further east the freightage on coal from the Witbank Collieries becomes less, and if this were the only consideration, it would be better to increase the capacity of stations located on the east end of the system than to transmit from either Rosherville and Simmerpan or Vereeniging. Unfortunately, the water supply at the present time constitutes a difficulty, and taking all things into consideration, it appears to me that if the capacity at Vereeniging had been considerably increased and that at Rosherville correspondingly decreased, it would have resulted in more economical generation than is the case with the present lay-out.","['Synchronous motors', 'Reactive power', 'Induction motors', 'Companies', 'Compressors', 'Propagation losses', 'Power factor correction']",[]

"(Associate Member): The thanks of this Institute are due to Professor Buchanan for bis interesting paper on this subject. My idea in these few notes this evening is not so much to criticise the author's paper as to endeavour to express a few thoughts that have occurred to me in reading the progress of the electrification of railways in various parts of the world. Early in the paper disappointment is expressed at the tardiness with which electricity has been applied to railways; this remark is especially brought home to us in this country when we remember that Africa is the only continent in which no rail way electrification or conversion schemes are actually in existence. The author rightly hits the mark when he says that possibly the authorities who postpone investigation of the subject until electricians agree upon the best system, have a valid reason for their conservatism. It is now for the Electrical Engineering profession to make out their case for the electrification of railways, and then for local conditions to prove the deciding factors in the choice of systems. The Railway Gazcttry in discussing this aspect of the question, says : “ Too much stress must not be laid on the disadvantages of lack of uniformity in the system of electrification adopted by different railways. …. It is better to put up with these disadvantages of electric working than to wai t until the best system is discovered or to put difficulties in the way of its ever being discovered by tying all railways down to rigid uniformity.” Nevertheless, in a country situated as we are 6,000 miles from manufacturing centres, it is well that before any electrification takes place the various schemes that have been worked out in other parts of the world should be well studied and considered so that when the time does come for the consideration of railway electrification in this country, our profession will be fully conversant with the difficulties that have been found in other schemes.","['Rail transportation', 'Oils', 'Stress', 'Safety', 'Rectifiers', 'Railway electrification', 'Rails']",[]
"The President: Before calling on Prof. Buchanan to reply to the discussion on his paper, I have great pleasure in extending a hearty welcome to Mr. Mills, Electrical Engineer to the South African Railways. I understand he proposes to say a few words on this paper. As you are aware, gentlemen, the subject of the electrification of railways is dealt with by Mr. Hoy, the General Manager of the South African Railways, in his report of last year. He thinks the time is now ripe for a report to be made on this matter dealing with South Africa generally, and, as it is a very important matter, I hope some result will come of it for the benefit of engineering generally. Prof. Buchanan is to be congratulated on having brought forward this question. I was to have contributed to the paper, but, unfortunately, I have not been able to find the time. My intention bad been to touch on that very much wider application of electricity : the supply of electrical power hand-in-hand with the electrification of railways throughout the country. I can safely predict that this side of the question will also have to be considered when electrification is being discussed. I feel certain that the linking up of the water powers now running to waste will assist in this greater scheme — the supply of cheap power for railways, irrigation, manufactures, and every other expansion in this country ; this is possible now as we know, for the way electrical supply has recently increased is an assurance that this is the direction of progress. I now have very much pleasure in calling on Mr. Mills.","['Rail transportation', 'Companies', 'Coal', 'Rectifiers', 'Rails', 'Generators', 'Voting']",[]

I make no claim to anything original in the paper; all I endeavoured to do was to collect what information I could on electro-magnetic waves and present this to you in as compact and simple a manner as possible. In so doing I lost sight of the fact that I was opening the door to some aspects of discussion on electro-magnetic waves to which it would be extraordinarily difficult to reply, particularly as radio to me is a hobby and not a profession.","['Ocean temperature', 'Sea surface', 'Surface waves', 'Earth', 'Atmospheric waves', 'Wireless communication', 'Conductivity']",[]

"An attempt is made to integrate this subject by bringing together all relevant data from the fields of shark protection, shark biology, neurophysiology, electrical fishing and electrical fish screens. Further tests to determine the conditions for electrotaxis in sharks are described The details of an experiment are given wherein an electrical anti-shark barrier was constructed and tested in the shark infested waters of St Lucia. An account is given of the methods adopted in solving some unusual problems which arose. These include the generation of a uniform electrical field in sea water, corrosion of electrodes, high-efficiency pulse-generation into an inductive load and the low-loss feeding of a low-impedance electrode system at the end of a long transmission line. The entire installation and experiment were carried out with a view to achieving a successful barrier with the minimum wastage of power. A 250 m barrier in 3 m of sea water consumed 35 kW. The experiment showed that electrotaxis is a necessary prerequisite for an electrical field to act as a repellant of harmful sharks.","['Electrodes', 'Corrosion', 'Wires', 'Testing', 'Storms', 'Sea surface', 'Rivers']",[]

This paper summarises an experiment developed to show the difference in EMI emitted by a hard- or soft-switched converter. The experiment was of a comparative nature. Both the development of the converters and measurement of their EMI is discussed. Both conducted and field induced EMI were measured. The soft-switched converter (auxiliary resonant commutated pole converter) shows big reductions in all EMI along with the benefits of lower losses and possible higher switching frequencies. The use of soft-switching techniques instead of conventional hard-switched topologies are therefore preferable in new designs.,"['Voltage measurement', 'Switches', 'Magnetic field measurement', 'Electromagnetic interference', 'Magnetic shielding', 'Magnetic noise', 'Topology']",[]

"It is well known that partial discharge activity is responsible for the deterioration of electrical insulation. In addition, partial discharge activity is also evidence of a degraded insulation system. Despite these facts no significant correlation has been found between partial discharge activity measured at the terminals of a rotating machine and the state of the insulation. In this paper it is proposed that the anomaly occurs because partial discharge measurements at the terminals of the machine are dominated by surface partial discharge activity in the overhang of the winding. These overhang discharges are not very damaging and mask the effects of small, but very damaging, discharges within the cell insulation in the slot area of the winding. An instrument is described which can distinguish between partial discharge activity in the slot and in the overhang. This instrument is used to make measurements on a stator where the cell insulation in the slot area has been deliberately damaged. These measurements vindicate the proposition made above.","['Discharges (electric)', 'Partial discharges', 'Insulation', 'Partial discharge measurement', 'Coils', 'Windings', 'Instruments']",[]
"After the historical development of engineering has been outlined to arrive at the concept of ‘environmental design’, the chaos currently present in some countries is discussed briefly in order to define its multiple cause. Subsequently the multiple solution to the problem is indicated, stressing that it has mainly a philosophical character, without which the process of environmental impact control, which is also discussed in general, cannot be executed effectively. It is explained that the appropriate philosophy centres around the proper definition of ‘environment’, and that the issue at stake is really the maintenance of balance between nature conservation and cultural development. Finally, the matrix and mapping techniques for documenting data in the environmental impact analysis process are discussed briefly.","['Legislation', 'Planning', 'Cultural differences', 'Chaos', 'Standards', 'Training', 'Roads']",[]

"A presentation of refractivity gradient and K-factor variation, based on radiosonde measurements carried out over 3 years in Maun, Botswana, is reported. It is observed that the median refractivity gradient within 0-200 m height range is -20 N-units/km. The percentage of the time for which the refractivity gradient is lower than -100 N-units/km is found to vary from a high 32% in February to 13% in August. Similarly, ducting is seen to be quite prevalent in summer (23% of the time in February, and 17% in November), while it is less prevalent in winter (12% of the time in May and 6% in August). A comparison between recent ITU-R plots for refractivity gradient and ducting occurrence frequency for the region, with the reported measurements, shows fairly close agreement. When ducting values are excluded, the median K value is found to be 1.1, while the effective value exceeded 99.9% of the time, K E , is 0.7. On the other hand, when all data are considered, the median value of K is found to be 1.03 while K E is determined to be 0.61.","['Refractive index', 'Atmospheric measurements', 'Earth', 'Terrestrial atmosphere', 'Ducts', 'ITU', 'Africa']","['Radio refractivity gradient', 'K-Factor', 'Atmospheric ducts', 'Radio refractivity measurements in Botswana']"
"Market-driven economies and deregulated electricity industry environment have stimulated the minimization of technical and non-technical losses (NTL) even though they do not constitute major operational or quality of supply problems. Their impact is economic and utilities often passed down the costs to consumers. NTL need to be addressed to determine the overall performance of power networks, as these losses are expected to be more dominant at the sub-transmission (132kV-33kV) and reticulation (22kV and 11kV) levels of the electricity supply industry value chain. In some national grid operations, NTL are estimated to account for up to 30% in revenue losses to electric utilities, and overhead expenditure in added maintenance costs. This paper discusses a method for NTL evaluation and an effective management approach to loss minimization and revenue collection.","['Business', 'Propagation losses', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Estimation', 'Privatization', 'Minimization', 'Meters']",[]

The construction and wiring of a typical informal dwelling was established and a test dwelling was built. The magnetic field in the dwelling was measured at twelve locations under different conditions. The effect of the construction materials, wiring practice and appliance choice is noted. A further survey of the levels of magnetic fields in twenty residences in an informal settlement in Ivory Park is described. The results of the survey are compared to those of previous South African and Australian studies which were performed exclusively on formal dwellings.

"Serious use of object technology involves a software development process based upon one of the various methods advocated in the literature and frequently supported by a CASE tool. The methods and associated tools rely on the use of particular notations during analysis and design phases: usually some form of relationship diagram to express a so-called static object model of the envisaged system; and state charts to depict a dynamic model. The dynamic model is meant to express object behaviour that results from inter-object communication (IOC). The intention is that these models should seamlessly carry over to inform and guide the implementation phase. In general, commonly-used notations for the static object model seem to serve their purpose well. However, there is some doubt about the efficacy of dynamic model notations, particularly the state chart variety used in OMT. The problem is intimately associated with IOC in which so-called inter-object conditions play a part. State-of-the-art mechanisms to handle such inter-object conditions at an implementation level appear to be inadequate. Several alternative solutions to the problem are proposed and evaluated.","['Software', 'Object oriented modeling', 'Object recognition', 'Tools', 'Analytical models', 'Switches', 'Semantics']","['Object communication', 'design pattern', 'dynamic model', 'object behaviour']"

Unfortunately, this is often restricted by the availability of water, transport facilities, or, at present, with nuclear stations, the avoidance of densely populated areas; more recently with conventional thermal stations the avoidance of air pollution 1 , rather surprisingly in the Los Angeles basin.

"The first three power stations of the Victoria Falls and Transvaal Power Company, Limited, were located on the Reef, at Brakpan, Simmerpan and Eosherville. These stations were adjacent to the load centres and long distance transmission lines were not necessary for conveying the power* from the stations to the various load points. In the early days, the distribution network on the Reef consisted of 10 kV and 20 kV overhead lines and, at a later### date, 40 kV distribution feeders and interconncctors were adopted. “With the growth of load and the general extension of the system, it became necessary to construct further power stations and, for reasons not relevant to the subject matter of this paper, these stations were located some distance from the Reef; the first of these was Vereeniging, 35 miles to the south of Johannesburg, followed by Witbank, 64 miles north-east of Brakpan and, later, Klip was installed, this station being about 32 miles to the south of Johannesburg.","['Circuit faults', 'Poles and towers', 'Conductors', 'Insulators', 'Lightning', 'Wires', 'Steel']",[]

It would be interesting to know if it has been used to test bushings other than the 6$md6 kV ones for which it was built, and if so, what results were obtained. It can be agreed that “a 20 per cent. power-factor bushing need not necessarily be nearer breakdown than a 15 per cent. bushing,” as this is largely conditioned by what portion of the composite structure comprising the bushing is giving rise to the high power-factor, and by the stress distribution. Actually, it is not a material point whether a bushing is 15 or 20 per cent., as it is difficult to consider any insulator with a power-factor of this order as other than a potential hazard.","['Insulators', 'Oils', 'Testing', 'Asphalt', 'Sodium', 'Stress', 'Porcelain']",[]

"When bringing forward this paper I intended to draw the attention of the local electrical engineers to the great field they had before them in South Africa for applying their knowledge and forces. I did not think, however, that much discussion would arise out of it, as this industry is unknown as yet in South Africa, and probably very few had any practical knowledge of it. In my opinion, it is not men who create an industry, but an industry that creates men. As soon as the rulers of the Union realise what riches are hidden in the first ten inches of the soil of South Africa, and as soon as South African agricultural products appear on the European markets—to conquer them—the manufacture of artificial nitrogen must and will spring up locally, and the new industry will then create those electrical engineers who will take a keen interest in this question.

"The increasing demand for underground high power electric transmission systems has stimulated the development of new insulating media. Sulphur hexaflouride (SF 6 ) has found wide applications for metalclad switchgear up to very high voltages and can also be used to insulate high voltage cables. The SF 6 molecule tends to form negative ions, which, in turn, leads to high breakdown strength. However, in practical applications considerable reduction of the breakdown voltage may occur due to the movement of free particles and to the shapes and surfaces of the unavoidable insulator spacers. Three-phase gas insulated cables have very favourable electrical parameters and high power transmission capabilities which can exceed 1 000 MVA without artificial cooling. First installations started operating only a few years ago. High voltage testing of gas insulated cables is a special problem because it has to be done on site. The high capacitance of the test object makes it necessary to develop new test techniques to ensure high reliability in service. Finally, attention is given to practical installations of SF 6 insulated transmission systems and expected developments of this very promising new technique as a means to improve the transmission and distribution of electrical energy.","['Electric breakdown', 'Electrodes', 'Sulfur hexafluoride', 'High-voltage techniques', 'Flashover', 'Switches', 'Gases']",[]

In the simulation, we assume that the fading is slow enough such that the receiver may perform perfect carrier recovery and synchronization. We find analytical expressions for the parameters of the model as a function of the average signal-to-noise ratio (for a fixed Doppler shift), and as a function of maximum Doppler shift (for a fixed average signal-to-noise ratio) by means of a curve fit.","['Mathematical model', 'Channel models', 'Signal to noise ratio', 'Doppler shift', 'Markov processes', 'Rayleigh channels', 'Numerical models']","['GMSK', 'Discrete Channel Models', 'Gilbert Model', 'Rayleigh fading']"

Means of minimising glare are described and a survey is given of numerous methods proposed during the past fifteen years for assessing direct glare quantitatively. The British Code method and the DGF-method proposed by the author are explained in detail. Some uncertainties discussed show that our understanding of glare is incomplete and that the intricate relations are not easily condensed into a simple specification rule. Nevertheless, prediction of glare by one of the existing methods can prevent serious design mistakes.","['Lighting', 'Fitting', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Task analysis', 'Indexes', 'Visualization', 'Shape']",[]
"The most frequent use of coaxial cable is to prevent electrical noise adding to signals passing between equipment. Ground voltage differences exist and appear in series with the signal. The screen of a coaxial cable grounded at both ends induces a voltage in the inner conductor which starts cancelling ground voltages at about 2.5 kHz and can produce -60 dB cancellation at 10 MHz. The signal current also produces a flux external to the screen, which induces a loop current through the screen and ground path. Above 2.5 kHz, the loop current starts opposing the returning ground current, redirecting it from the lower impedance ground path to the screen, thereby reducing the external magnetic field. An equivalent circuit explains the phenomena and the extreme sensitivity of coax and oscilloscope probes to short pigtail leads. Experiments and data are described which justify the theory. Remarks are made on pigtails, cable trays, and feeding power via coax.","['Inductance', 'Conductors', 'Coaxial cables', 'Wires', 'Mathematical model', 'Geometry', 'Impedance']","['Coaxial cable', 'Coax', 'ground voltage', 'ground current', 'pigtail', 'EMC']"

"Abstract With the rapid expansion of the Internet and packet switched networks, combined voice and video communication via packet switched networks is becoming a reality. Two major technologies are currently implemented for real time voice and video communication over IP: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the ITU-T's H.323 standard. In order to bill for voice and video services delivered via the Internet, billable information needs to be extracted from the packet flow. The H.323 standard incorporates various protocols for voice and video communication purposes the most important being the RTP/RTCP media transport protocols, the H.225 call signalling protocols, and the H.245 call control protocol. We firstly determine whether the H.323 suite of protocols contain extractable information for use in billing. This paper then shows how sufficient information can be extracted from the IP packet flow for billing and service level agreement purposes of H.323 Internet-based calls.","['Protocols', 'IP networks', 'Ports (computers)', 'Monitoring', 'Internet', 'Data mining', 'Real-time systems']","['H.323 Standard', 'Session Initiation Protocol', 'IP Packet Flow', 'Service Level Agreement', 'Packet Switched Networks']"

"Electric energy at a moderate cost is one of the fundamental prerequisites for the development of any community. The supply of electric energy to decentralized communities is however associated with long, low power transmission lines, highly distorted supplies, high capital and maintenance costs and low reliability.

Typical photovoltaic solar panels, small wind and hydro turbines and non-renewable diesel generators can be utilized as complementary energy sources, which can be combined in a cost effective manner with major savings on capital expenditure and thus with overall energy cost savings.

"The accepted 50/60 Hz current, human electro-physiological threshold responses of feeling, let-go, difficult breathing, fibrillation & convulsions are reviewed, Similar response thresholds are required for the safe design of electrical shark repellents where the relevant parameter measured in sea-water is volt per metre. An experiment is described which hypothesizes a simple proportional relationship between the two sets of electrical conditions. This involves the use of a single test subject as a “transfer standard” between the two. The transfer coefficient was determined at the threshold of feeling and used to predict where the let-go threshold field strength in sea-water should lie. The equivalent ‘let-go’ threshold case was determined. This estimate confirmed the predicted value. The same proportional relationship is consequently applied to indicate the threshold field strength at which difficult breathing, fibrillation and convulsions may occur.

"When the IEC Committee for standards covering electrical equipment in medical practice (Technical Committee No. 62) held its first meeting in 1968, the acting Chairman of TC 62, Professor F Wachsmann, stated that ‘radiation protection can be better achieved by one gram of human brains than by a kilogram of lead’. This statement signalled the future direction of TC 62 in preparing standards for radiation equipment used in medical practice. Through the work of medical experts from all corners of the world representing the views of manufacturers, the medical professions, hospital authorities and other interested parties, thirteen standards covering radiation aspects have been issued and have become widely used in the medical world. But the work of TC 62 has not only dealt with radiation — it has been expanded to cover the total needs of medical electrical equipment. Some 20 standards have been issued to date including Publication 601-1, the comprehensive general safety standard thai applies to all types of medical electrical equipment. Work in hand covers some 40 other medical electrical standards.

This paper describes an investigation into the use of a modern multivariable controller design technique which improves the performance of a voltage-source-fed induction motor. It presents the induction motor nonlinear mathematical model from which a linearized model is deduced. The Inverse Nyquist Array controller design method is then applied to the linearized model to generate a control scheme which uses airgap flux and motor speed as outputs and source voltage and frequency as inputs. The scheme is then implemented software-wise on the nonlinear simulation model in order to assess its dynamic performance. Results from these simulations demonstrate that the motor's transient performance can be considerably improved by using a multivariable controller.,"['Induction motors', 'Mathematical model', 'Voltage control', 'Atmospheric modeling', 'Rotors', 'Transient analysis', 'Transfer functions']",[]

"This paper contributes by providing a linear differential equation which captures the response of residential dial-up subscribers to a tariff function. South African data was gathered on residential subscribers who were making use of cheaper off-peak rates for dial-up Internet service outside business hours. Traffic intensity was found to be heavily dependent on the call tariff, with the steepest increase in traffic occurring at the time of rate changeover. It was also unexpectedly found that the traffic intensity dropped off exponentially as subscribers completed their tasks. The subscribers' response to a tariff change was then treated as a dynamic system, with input x(t) being the excitation function, representing the tariff imposed by the single network operator, and an output y(t), to represent the function of the traffic resulting from the imposed tariff. The response to the sudden tariff decrease was thus captured in a linear differential equation. Using the equation, the subscribers' response to a set of interesting tariff scenarios has been predicted. As a result, recommendations for superior tariffing are made.","['Tariffs', 'Internet', 'Modems', 'ISDN', 'Solid modeling', 'Business', 'Dynamical systems']","['Model', 'modem', 'dial-up subscriber traffic', 'response', 'behaviour', 'step', 'tariff', 'postponed Poisson']"
"A difficulty in constructing dependable, fault-tolerant distributed computer control systems is the problem of preventing faults in one part the system from spreading to other parts.

"In this paper we introduce the construction of new families of error-correcting codes based on irregular low-density parity-check codes (LDPC), which we called generalized irregular low-density (GILD) codes. GILD codes are constructed by replacing each single parity check in LDPC codes with the parity check matrix of a small linear block code called the constituent code. The average weight distribution of GILD codes over all possible interleavers is derived as a function of the component code and the code length N. We also study iterative decoding of GILD codes for communication over an additive while Gaussian noise channel. The high flexibility in selecting the parameters of GILD codes and their better performance make them more attractive than GLD codes and hence suitable for small and large block length forward error correcting schemes.","['Error probability', 'Maximum likelihood decoding', 'Block codes', 'Upper bound', 'Iterative decoding', 'Data models', 'Turbo codes']","['Iterative decoding', 'low-density parity-check codes']"

"Expressions are doveloped for the fields established by the Hertzian dipole and by the magnetic dipole in terms of dipole moments. The expressions hold when the derivatives of the dipole moments are continuous for all values of time. It is then assumed that the moment M obeys a hyperbolic tangent law M-tanh(kt) and an insight into the nature of impulsive fields is obtained by considering the condition k-in when the function becomes a step. General expressions for impulse fields are then formulated, and an example is worked to illustrate some properties of impulse fields.

"The industrialisation of any new technical system requires the establishment of the required industrial infrastructure and supplier base for the system. This paper describes a methodology for the determination of industrialisation guidelines for such programmes. The methodology considers three types of considerations. They are 1) Strategic & Operational Requirements, 2) Market Considerations, and 3) Current Industrial Capabilities. These are evaluated and the scores are combined to calculate the recommended industrialisation guidelines. There are four possible outcomes or guidelines that this methodology produces. They are for 1) Local procurement, 2) Overseas procurement, 3) Partnership procurement, or 4) Competitive procurement. Two examples of the application of this methodology are given. These are for the armaments industry and the Pebble Bed Modular Nuclear Reactor project.","['Procurement', 'Industries', 'Guidelines', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Buildings', 'Technology transfer', 'Logistics']","['Industrialisation guidelines', 'procurement', 'armaments industry', 'Pebble Bed Modular Nuclear Reactor']"
"Experience shows that it is difficult to select, from an ever-widening set of software tools, those appropriate for a given project. Complicating the choice beyond mere vendor selection is a proliferation of open source offerings. An abstract model is proposed to assist in this selection process. In this model, generic elements of a rational decision making process are identified. The model is realized in a matrix in which rows represent tools and columns represent tool properties. This tool matrix is developed iteratively, starting off with an initial attempt to articulate those tool properties perceived to be important in the project. The criticality of each property is also estimated. This information constitutes the column headings. Tools described in available information sources constitute the rows, with their compliance to the required properties indicated in the appropriate cells of the matrix. Rows are grouped together in functional categories — e.g. version systems, modeling tools, etc. Columns are grouped in terms of properties typically associated with a given functional category. The result is a visual representation of the extent to which identified tools meet properties. This serves as a basis for selecting one or more tools to meet the desired requirements. Iteration of the model consists of evaluating the coverage of these requirements, refinement of properties and trade off between alternatives. Experience in using the model in a number of industrial contexts is discussed. The case studies show that the process forces one to consider as many alternatives and prerequisites as are necessary, and to systematically make ones reasoning explicit. This experience leads to the conclusion that the discipline demanded to construct the model has rational decisions as its payoff, based on well-assimilated information summarized in the tool matrix.","['Tools', 'Computer aided software engineering', 'Software', 'Industries', 'Visualization', 'Documentation', 'Task analysis']","['Software Development Tools', 'Software Engineering', 'Tool matrix', 'Tool selection']"

"The paper reviews the present state of knowledge regarding oil/paper dielectrics and analyses the factors that reduce service life. It is found that insulating oil in contact with air absorbs oxygen which attacks hydrocarbon molecules under the Influence of heat, producing the well-known oxidation products — organic acids and sludge. Organic acid has long been considered a major contaminant of transformer oil. But research and experience indicate that its most harmful effects are not the erosion of metals below oil level, which is negligible, nor the degradation of oil and paper insulation but Its effect in raising the hygroscopy of oil. Although humidity has practically no effect on oil oxidation, an Increase in oil's affinity for water accelerates the absorption and transfer of moisture from air in contact with the oil to the extremely hygroscopic paper insulation immersed in it. The combined effects of temperature, oxygen and humidity lead to polymerisation of oil and oxidation products, and decomposition of paper insulation leading to the eventual breakdown of a transformer in service. Modern methods of conditioning and testing insulating oil, as well as the economics of oil purification, are reviewed.","['Oils', 'Oil insulation', 'Power transformer insulation', 'Vegetable oils', 'Maintenance engineering', 'Purification', 'Oxidation']",[]
"Insulation co-ordination implies the selection of the electric insulation characteristics of equipment with regard to its application and in relation to its surroundings. Consideration must be given to the voltages which can appear within the system, to the location and characteristics of the overvoltage protective devices, to the continuity of service desired and to the safety of persons and property, so that the probability of undesired incidents due to voltage stresses is reduced to ensure an economically and operationally acceptable performance. In recent years, the IEC set up Sub-Committee 28A: Insulation Co-ordination for Low-voltage Equipment, to establish an international system for insulation co-ordination within low-voltage systems. This would eliminate present problems caused through existing standards which specify diverse design criteria for dimensions of clearances and creepage distances. For equipment, it would also enable designers to specify insulation performance criteria for electrical equipment and installations and systems which are becoming more complex. SC 28A was assigned a ‘safety pilot function’, which meant that its recommendations would be taken into consideration by other Technical and Sub-Committees when specifying creepage and clearance distance requirements for products for which they are responsible.","['Insulation', 'Voltage control', 'IEC Standards', 'Standards', 'Safety', 'Pollution', 'Low voltage']",[]

"This paper addresses the application of intelligent adaptive control in an industrial process. Implementation of the technique in a practical system should lead to gaining confidence and acceptance of the methodology. An important rationale for the work is the potential of an intelligent adaptive control technique to overcome some shortcomings of conventional control approaches. An intelligent adaptive control (IAC) technique, which is analogous to conventional model-referenced adaptive control (MRAC) is presented. This scheme uses a fuzzy knowledge base and an inference mechanism for making tuning decisions of a lead compensator in the control loop. As a case study, IAC is implemented on an industrial fish processing machine. In order to show the effectiveness of the intelligent scheme, a conventional MRAC is implemented on the same machine, and the performance under the two techniques is compared. It is found that IAC is able to perform as well as MRAC, while possessing better flexibility in design, ease of implementation, and computational efficiency.","['Fish', 'Adaptive control', 'Adaptation models', 'Feature extraction', 'Process control', 'Lead', 'Servomotors']","['Intelligent adaptive control', 'model-referenced adaptive control', 'lead compensator', 'fuzzy logic', 'industrial fish processing']"

"Photography of lightning strokes with the Boys camera has shown that each separate stroke is of a dual nature, consisting of a leader and a return portion. It has been shown that the return stroke travels from ground to cloud, passing outwards along the brandies when it reaches branching points of the leader. The charge on the leader branches passes in this manner to ground.

"Internetworking standards have enabled designers of internets to use devices from multiple vendors. In the design of an internet, two of the major technical problems revolve around the optimum selection of links between nodes and the location of the root of the tree which spans the configuration. The tree and its root form a heirachy of branches which link all nodes in an internet such that no loop paths exist between nodes. This paper describes how an Internet Descriptor can be used to assess effects on performance and reliability of the location of the root and configuration of the tree in an internet. In the two design examples, internet trees are examined in terms of their compactness. Internet throughput, end-to-end transmission time, configuration balancing and cost are all directly related to the degree of compactness of the tree, as is shown.","['Internet', 'Bridges', 'Indexes', 'Local area networks', 'Standards', 'Routing', 'Loading']",[]

"The post-war years have seen thfe growth in overseas countries of a new sphere of knowledge which shows signs of affecting mens thinking in diverse fields of activity and which is of importance to telecommunication engineers. It is known either as Communication Theory or the Theory of Information. The statistics of languages, the study of the human nervous system, the behaviour and design of self-stabilizing mechanisms and digital computers are examples of its wide field of application. In electrical communication, it is of specific interest because it permits a fundamental assessment to be made of the performance of the various types of present-day communication systems and thus promises to help in the design and development of future ones.

South Africa has very little developed law on the subject and it would be in our interests to borrow the best from elsewhere. In this regard the United States has something of real value to offer and development of our law by the absorption of the ‘shop right’ doctrine is not only recommended but appears possible within the framework of our common law.","['Technological innovation', 'Patents', 'Employment', 'Production facilities', 'Tools', 'Industries', 'Task analysis']",[]

"Since an electronic inverter is not far removed from the ‘chopper’ modulated dc voltage controller, it has bean suggested that the dc motor be replaced by an ac machine in a battery vehicle. The advantage of using a more robust and cheaper motor hat to be weighed against an increase in the complexity and cost of the additional electronic equipment. It may also be possible to achieve a better motor characteristic with respect to the requirements of the drive. A system is described which employs a synchronous motor driven by a transistorized inverter. The experimental results of the combination show a promising torque-speed characteristic with a large starting torque provided armature reaction is reduced. The inverter is arranged to incorporate voltage control so that the motor may be operated at maximum flux per pole over its entire speed range. The results show that it is necessary to control voltage and internal angle to retain the advantages of the system.","['Transistors', 'Inverters', 'Torque', 'Voltage control', 'Switches', 'Traction motors', 'Synchronous motors']",[]

The maximum observed frequency (MOF) and the lowest observed frequency on the low-angle ray (LLOF) were scaled, and inverse transmission curves were used to estimate the equivalent vertical frequency (EVFO) for the ordinary ray. The data are used to show the frequency ranges and times of day for which transmission in the different modes may be expected.","['Sun', 'Read only memory', 'Ionosphere', 'Integrated circuits', 'Antarctica', 'Vents', 'Transmitters']",[]
