Unlike other synchronous grammars, the grammar allows multiple target productions to be associated to a single production rule which can be used to guide a parser to infer different possible translational equivalences for a recognized input string according to the feature constraints of symbols in the pattern. An extended generalized LR algorithm was adapted to the parsing of the proposed formalism to analyze the syntactic structure of a language.

The empirical results show that the grammar is more expressive when modeling the translational equivalences of parallel texts for machine translation and grammar rewriting applications.': 2,\n"," 'The paper describes che generation of electromagnetic interference on the 3 kV dc networks as a result of the rectification process and the methods that have been employed to eliminate or reduce the interference to acceptable limits.

To implement the plant (sensor), controller, and actuator nodes, an agent-based design is introduced, and a multi-agent networked control system is constructed. Therefore, the network simulator 2–26 (NS-2.26) release is extended by modifying the user data protocol (UDP) common header in order to support application data transmission between network nodes. Then, modifying the network topology parameters, networked control system simulations are analyzed for different parameter changes, such as the network bandwidth, the number of plant nodes, and the sampling period. An analysis of the influence of these parameters on network-induced delays and packet drop is made.

However, unlike normal point-to-point multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels, DAS channels have different large-scale fadings from different transmit antennas, thus making equal power and rate transmission that is feasible in MIMO channels unrealistic in DAS channels. This paper proposes a novel transmit antenna selection scheme with power and rate allocation. The scheme is based on large-scale fading (shadow fading and path loss) and is suitable for VBLAST structures with zero-forcing and successive interference cancellation (ZF-SIC) receivers, ensuring balanced average symbol error rate (SER) performance in each layer. On the receiver side, a fixed detection order is used, which is obtained in the transmit antenna selection process. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme gives good performance gains over equal power and rate transmission systems without antenna selection.': 2,\n"," 'Magnetic cores made of ferrite are nowadays irreplaceable in many spheres of telecommunications.': 2,\n"," 'On Saturday afternoon, the 15th July, by the kind invitation of the Directors and the Chief Engineer of the Company, about 70 members of the Institute, paid a visit to the Generating Station at Simmer Pan, near Germiston.

Motivating by the mechanism of natural neurons, the MW-OBS method balances the accuracy and the time complexity to achieve better neural network performance.

Frequency reserves are an example of system-wide ancillary services. In this regard, this article deals with the optimal operation of a local energy community (LEC) located in the distribution network. The LEC is proposed to participate in providing manual frequency restoration reserves (mFRR) or tertiary reserves. In addition, the community is supposed to have a number of electric vehicles (EVs) and a battery energy storage system (BESS) as FERs. The scheduling of the community, which is fully compliant with the existing balancing market structure, comprises two stages. The first stage is performed in day-ahead, in which the energy community management center (ECMC) estimates the amount of available flexible capacities for mFRR provision. In this stage, control parameters are deployed by the ECMC in order to control the offered flexibility of the BESS. In the second stage, the real-time scheduling of the community is performed for each hour, taking into account the assigned and activated amount of reserve power. The target of the real-time stage is to maximize the community's profit. Finally, the model is implemented utilizing a case study considering different day-ahead control parameters of the BESS. The results demonstrate that the proposed control parameters adopted in the day-ahead stage considerably affect the real-time profitability of the LEC. Moreover, according to the simulation results, participating in the mFRR market can bring additional profits for the LEC.\": 2,\n"," \"A copy of this report, which is published by the Prevention of Accidents Committee, is available to members in the Institute's Library.\": 2,\n"," 'This is a revised version of the manuscript entitled !0Performance Analysis and Experimental Investigation of Physical-Layer Security in OCDMA-Based Hybrid FSO/Fiber Wiretap Channel!1.

It has been difficult in many instances to explain why in one case the use of the rays would cause degeneration and at others regeneration of similar tissues; why, for example, in one patient superflous hair would be removed and in another the use of the rays on a smooth skin would result in a profuse hirsute adornment. In recent years, however means have been devised of regulating the dose of the X-rays and of estimating in units the amount of radiation being administered in each case. This has made the study of the action more accurate and has enabled the illumination of several obscure points. In the Berliner klinische Wochenschrift for May 23, 1910, H. E. Schmidt reports a small series of experiments into the effect of various doses of the X-ray upon cell growth. Having soaked a number of beans in water for six hours he treated the different beans with different doses of rays, and then planted them. His results were quite uniform and demonstrated two points of interest. Whereas those beans which were treated with large doses of the rays were partially or completely inhibited in their growth, as compared to untreated control beans, those which received very small doses were distinctly stimulated; not only were the plants larger and more vigorous, but the flowers were larger and the resulting crop of beans better. From these findings Schmidt suggests that the same principle may apply to animal cells, and experiments which he carried out on an ulcer on the arm suggested that this is the case. If this be so, it is evident that in treating conditions in which healing is desired, as a sluggish ulcer, very small doses of the X-ray should be used, whereas in cases of malignant growth, where tissue destruction is required, large doses are needed, and small doses instead of destraying the neoplasm may do harm rather than good by stimulating it to renewed activity. — Electrical Review and Western Electrician, July 30. 1910, p. 234.': 2,\n"," 'This proved to be a lively session and over 20 participants contributed to the discussion.

The controller designed here consists of a linear feedback part and a nonlinear part. The linear part is responsible for stability and fast response of the closed-loop system. The nonlinear part serves to increase the damping ratio of closed-loop poles as the controlled output approaches the target reference. The CNF control brings together the good points of both the small and the large damping ratio cases, by continuously scheduling the damping ratio of the dominant closed-loop poles and thus has the capability for superior transient performance, i. e. a fast output response with low overshoot. In the presence of constant disturbances, an integral action is included so as to remove the static bias. An explicitly parameterized controller is derived for servo positioning systems characterized by second-order model. Practical application in a micro hard disk drive servo system is then presented, together with some discussion of the rationale and characteristics of such design.

However, gathering sufficient cases of faulty conditions in real-world engineering scenarios to train an intelligent diagnosis system is challenging. This paper proposes a fault diagnosis method combining several augmentation schemes to alleviate the problem of limited fault data. We begin by identifying relevant parameters that influence the construction of a spectrogram. We leverage the uncertainty principle in processing time-frequency domain signals, making it impossible to simultaneously achieve good time and frequency resolutions. A key determinant of this phenomenon is the window function's choice and length used in implementing the short-time Fourier transform.

However, the traditional Weisskopf-Wigner (W-W) theory fails to deal with those processes other than spontaneous emission. To solve this problem, we provide a new method based on the renormalization theory. We evaluate the renormalized time-ordered Green functions associated with the single-photon processes, and relate them to the corresponding state vectors. It is found that the ultraviolet divergences generated by the Lamb shift and higher-order interactions can be systematically subtracted in the state vectors. The discussions on spontaneous emission and single-photon absorption are then presented to illustrate the proposed method. For spontaneous emission, we obtain the same results of the W-W theory. For single-photon absorption where W-W theory fails, we find that the two-level electric dipole first gets excited rapidly and then decays exponentially, and that the efficiency of the single-photon absorption declines as the bandwidth of the incident photon becomes narrow.

In this paper, we propose a deep SEI approach via multidimensional feature extraction for radio frequency fingerprints (RFFs), namely, RFFsNet-SEI. Particularly, we extract multidimensional physical RFFs from the received signal by virtue of variational mode decomposition (VMD) and Hilbert transform (HT). The physical RFFs and I-Q data are formed into the balanced-RFFs, which are then used to train RFFsNet-SEI. As introducing model-aided RFFs into neural network, the hybrid-driven scheme including physical features and I-Q data is constructed. It improves physical interpretability of RFFsNet-SEI. Meanwhile, since RFFsNet-SEI identifies individual of emitters from received raw data in end-to-end, it accelerates SEI implementation and simplifies procedures of identification. Moreover, as the temporal features and spectral features of the received signal are both extracted by RFFsNet-SEI, identification accuracy is improved.

Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method outperforms the counterparts on the basis of simulation dataset and real dataset collected in the anechoic chamber.': 1,\n"," 'Quorum systems have been used to solve the problem of data consistency in distributed fault-tolerance systems.

It is difficult to predict, and the actual echo of multiple scattered points is not fully matched with the transmitted signal. Therefore, it is challenging for the traditional matching filter method to achieve a complete matching effect in wideband echo detection. In addition, the energy dispersion of complex target echoes is still a problem in radar target detection under broadband conditions. Therefore, this paper proposes a wideband target detection method based on dual-channel correlation processing of rangeextended targets. This method fully uses the spatial distribution characteristics of target scattering points of echo signal and the matching characteristics of the dual-channel point extension function itself. The radial accumulation of wideband target echo signal in the complex domain is realized through the adaptive correlation processing of a dual-channel echo signal. The accu-mulation effect of high matching degree is achieved to improve the detection probability and the performance of wideband detection.

If experimentally confirmed, the studies here submitted would therefore imply that, not only the neutron can be produced via the proton-electron synthesis, but all unstable hadrons can be artificially produced via the synthesis of ligther hadrons usually selected in the decay with the lowest mode, which would then acquire the meaning of tunnel effect of the constituents.

In the analysis, the Middleton's class A model is used as a model of the impulsive noise. At first, the statistical characteristics of the in-phase and quadrature components of the impulsive noise are investigated, and it is proved that unlike Gaussian noise, these components are dependent especially on the impulsive noise with small impulsive indices. The probability that the high amplitude noise is emitted in the in-phase component which becomes firstly larger and then smaller for the larger quadrature component of impulsive noise is presented. Next, the performance of conventional UWB radio systems designed for the Gaussian noise under the impulsive noise is evaluated and numerical results show that the performance of the conventional UWB radio systems is much degraded by the effect of the impulsive noise. Using the dependence between the in-phase and quadrature components of the impulsive noise, a novel UWB receiver designed for impulsive noise is proposed and the performance improvement achieved by the receiver is evaluated.

Many useful electronic image stabilization algorithms have been studied. A real-time algorithm is proposed based on field image gray projection which enables the regional odd and even field image to be projected into x and y directions and thus to get the regional gray projection curves in x and y directions, respectively. For the odd field image channel, motion parameters can be estimated via iterative minimum absolute difference based on two successive field image regional gray projection curves. Then motion compensations can be obtained after using the Kalman filter method. Finally, the odd field image is adjusted according to the compensations. In the mean time, motion compensation is applied to the even field image channel with the odd field image gray projection curves of the current frame. By minimizing absolute difference between odd and even field image gray projection curves of the current frame, the inter-field motion parameters can be estimated. Therefore, the even field image can be adjusted by combining the inter-field motion parameters and the odd field compensations. Finally, the stabilized image sequence can be obtained by synthesizing the adjusted odd and even field images. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can run in real-time and have a good stabilization performance. In addition, image blurring can be improved.': 1,\n"," 'An approach to detection of moving objects in video sequences, with application to video surveillance is presented.

Subsequently, the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is adopted to optimize the objective function to estimate model parameters, and then CSO focal plane trajectories and radiant intensities are computed. Meanwhile, the estimated CSO focal plane trajectories from multiple space-based infrared focal planes are associated and filtered to estimate the CSO stereo ballistic trajectories. Finally, the performance (CSO estimation precision of the focal plane coordinates, radiant intensities, and stereo ballistic trajectories, together with the computation load) of the algorithm is tested, and the results show that the algorithm is effective and feasible.': 1,\n"," 'The global bandwidth shortage facing wireless carriers has motivated the exploration of the underutilized millimeter wave (mm-wave) frequency spectrum for future broadband cellular communication networks.

During the improving process, this paper regards the reduction of consistency ratio (CR) as benefit, and the maximum modification compared to the original pairwise comparison matrix (PCM) as cost, then the improvement of consistency is transformed to a benefit/cost analysis problem. According to the maximal marginal effect principle, the elements of PCM are modified by a fixed increment (or decrement) step by step till the consistency ratio becomes acceptable, which can ensure minimum adjustment to the original PCM so that the decision makers' judgment is preserved as much as possible. The correctness of the proposed method is proved mathematically by theorem. Firstly, the marginal benefit/cost ratio is calculated for each single element of the PCM when it has been modified by a fixed increment (or decrement). Then, modification to the element with the maximum marginal benefit/cost ratio is accepted. Next, the marginal benefit/cost ratio is calculated again upon the revised matrix, and followed by choosing the modification to the element with the maximum marginal benefit/cost ratio. The process of calculating marginal effect and choosing the best modified element is repeated for each revised matrix till acceptable consistency is reached, i.e., CR<;0.1. Finally, illustrative examples show the proposed method is more effective and better in preserving the original comparison information than existing methods.\": 1,\n"," 'To achieve robust communication in high mobility scenarios, an iterative equalization algorithm based on alternating minimization (AM) is proposed for the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) system.

The theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed fractional phase estimation algorithm exhibits almost the same performance as the ML algorithm but with significantly reduced computational burden.': 1,\n"," 'This study deals with the problem of mainlobe jamming suppression for rotated array radar. The interference becomes spatially nonstationary while the radar array rotates, which causes the mismatch between the weight and the snapshots and thus the loss of target signal to noise ratio (SNR) of pulse compression.

The conventional motion models in Cartesian coordinates imply that the trajectory of a target is completely determined by its dynamic characteristics. However, this is not true in the applications of road-target, sea-route-target or flight route-target tracking, where target trajectory shape is uncoupled with target velocity properties. In this paper, a new estimation algorithm based on separate modeling of target trajectory shape and dynamic characteristics is proposed. The trajectory of a target over a sliding window is described by a linear function of the arc length. To determine the unknown target trajectory, an augmented system is derived by denoting the unknown coefficients of the function as states in mileage coordinates. At every estimation cycle except the first one, the interaction (mixing) stage of the proposed algorithm starts from the latest estimated base state and a recalculated parameter vector, which is determined by the least squares (LS).

However, high computational complexity and storage cost make deep learning difficult to be used on resource-constrained devices, and it is not environmental-friendly with much power cost. In this paper, we focus on low-rank optimization for efficient deep learning techniques. In the space domain, DNNs are compressed by low rank approximation of the network parameters, which directly reduces the storage requirement with a smaller number of network parameters. In the time domain, the network parameters can be trained in a few subspaces, which enables efficient training for fast convergence. The model compression in the spatial domain is summarized into three categories as pre-train, pre-set, and compression-aware methods, respectively. With a series of integrable techniques discussed, such as sparse pruning, quantization, and entropy coding, we can ensemble them in an integration framework with lower computational complexity and storage. In addition to summary of recent technical advances, we have two findings for motivating future works. One is that the effective rank, derived from the Shannon entropy of the normalized singular values, outperforms other conventional sparse measures such as the I norm for network compression. The other is a spatial and temporal balance for tensorized neural networks. For accelerating the training of tensorized neural networks, it is crucial to leverage redundancy for both model compression and subspace training.': 1,\n"," 'A new iterative algorithm is proposed to reconstruct an unknown sparse signal from a set of projected measurements.

The basic premise of this model is that each sub-dictionary possesses discriminative information about its corresponding source, and this information can be used to recover almost every sample from that source. However, in a more general sense, the samples from a source are composed not only of discriminative information but also common information shared with other sources. This paper proposes learning a discriminative high-fidelity dictionary to improve the separation performance. The innovations are threefold. Firstly, an extra sub-dictionary was combined into a conventional union dictionary to ensure that the source-specific sub-dictionaries can capture only the purely discriminative information for their corresponding sources because the common information is collected in the additional sub-dictionary. Secondly, a task-driven learning algorithm is designed to optimize the new union dictionary and a set of weights that indicate how much of the common information should be allocated to each source. Thirdly, a source separation scheme based on the learned dictionary is presented. Experimental results on a human speech dataset yield evidence that our algorithm can achieve better separation performance than either state-of-the-art or traditional algorithms.\": 1,\n"," 'Learning is widely used in intelligent planning to shorten the planning process or improve the plan quality.

The existing multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches deal with the MAS with a specific number of agents, and can learn well-performed policies. However, if there is an increasing number of agents, the previously learned in may not perform well in the current scenario. The new agents need to learn from scratch to find optimal policies with others, which may slow down the learning speed of the whole team. To solve that problem, in this paper, we propose a new algorithm to take full advantage of the historical knowledge which was learned before, and transfer it from the previous agents to the new agents. Since the previous agents have been trained well in the source environment, they are treated as teacher agents in the target environment. Correspondingly, the new agents are called student agents. To enable the student agents to learn from the teacher agents, we first modify the input nodes of the networks for teacher agents to adapt to the current environment. Then, the teacher agents take the observations of the student agents as input, and output the advised actions and values as supervising information. Finally, the student agents combine the reward from the environment and the supervising information from the teacher agents, and learn the optimal policies with modified loss functions. By taking full advantage of the knowledge of teacher agents, the search space for the student agents will be reduced significantly, which can accelerate the learning speed of the holistic system.

Previous methods based on event pairs or the entire event chain may ignore much structural and semantic information. Current datasets for event prediction, naturally, can be used for supervised learning.

The numerical simulation results demonstrate that the radio wave propagation scattered by acoustic scatterer has the characteristic of forward tropospheric scatter. When the radio waves are scattered, they distribute in all directions; a majority of radio waves continues to propagate along the original direction, and only a small part of the energy is scattered. For the same acoustic scatterer, if we merely change the radio wave emission elevation, the horizontal spans of forward scattering radio wave packets centers gradually decrease with the increasing of emission elevations; and the energy of wave packets increases firstly and then decreases with launching elevation, reaching the maximum at a certain angle. If we merely change the wave emitting position, the horizontal spans decrease with the increasing of emission positions, and the energy of wave packets also increases firstly and then decreases with launch position, reaching the maximum at a certain position. This approach can be very promising for atmospheric scatter communications.': 1,\n"," 'With the development of central-private enterprises integration, selecting suitable key suppliers are able to provide core components for smart complex equipment.

In response, researchers have developed methods for creating synthetic SAR data for targets using electro-magnetic prediction software, which is then used to enrich an existing measured training dataset. However, this approach relies on the availability of some amount of measured data. In this work, we focus on the case of having 100% synthetic training data, while testing on only measured data. We use the SAMPLE dataset public released by AFRL, and find significant challenges to learning generalizable representations from the synthetic data due to distributional differences between the two modalities and extremely limited training sample quantities. Using deep learning-based ATR models, we propose data augmentation, model construction, loss function choices, and ensembling techniques to enhance the representation learned from the synthetic data, and ultimately achieved over 95% accuracy on the SAMPLE dataset. We then analyze the functionality of our ATR models using saliency and feature-space investigations and find them to learn a more cohesive representation of the measured and synthetic data. Finally, we evaluate the out-of-library detection performance of our synthetic-only models and find that they are nearly 10% more effective than baseline methods at identifying measured test samples that do not belong to the training class set.

Time series of PALSAR-2/ScanSAR data and Landsat data were used to examine the differences in detection timing of deforestation in the most active deforestation sites in Peru and Brazil. The γ 0 HH value increased by 0.8 dB on average for areas undergoing early-stages of deforestation, in which felled trees were left on the ground. The detection timing was almost the same as that of using the optical sensor. On the other hand, the γ 0 HV value does not show significant γ 0 change at this early-stage of deforestation. The γ 0 HV value started to decrease 1-1.5 months after the deforestation was detected by Landsat. The γ 0 HV value decreased by 1.5-1.6 dB, 4-5 months after the deforestation. To understand the radar backscattering mechanism at the early-stage deforestation sites, field experiments were carried out 2-16 days after the PALSAR-2/fully-polarimetric observations. The early-stage deforestation sites revealed 1.1-2.5 dB and 2.9-4.0 dB increases for σ 0 HH and σ 0 surface, respectively. This can be explained by the direct (single bounce) scattering from felled trees left on the ground. The sites in which felled trees were removed and the surfaces were flattened showed 5.2-5.3 dB and 5.3-5.5 dB decreases for σ 0 HV and σ 0 volume, respectively. This can be explained by the lower sensitivity of the HV polarization to both the branches remaining on the ground and the surface roughness, along with its increased sensitivity to the forest biomass. We conclude that an increase in L-band γ 0 HH is a good indicator for detecting early-stage deforestation sites, where felled trees are left on the ground, while γ 0 HV may be useful for detecting later-stage deforestation sites.': 1,\n"," \"Over the past two decades, remote sensing has made possible the routine global monitoring of surface soil moisture. Regional agricultural drought monitoring is one of the most logical application areas for such monitoring. However, remote sensing alone provides soil moisture information for only the top few centimeters of the soil profile, while agricultural drought monitoring requires knowledge of the amount of water present in the entire root zone. The assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture products into continuous soil water balance models provides a way of addressing this shortcoming. Here, we describe the assimilation of NASA's soil moisture active passive (SMAP) surface soil moisture data into the United States Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service (USDA FAS) Palmer model and assess the impact of SMAP on USDA FAS drought monitoring capabilities. The assimilation of SMAP is specifically designed to enhance the model skill and the USDA FAS drought capabilities by correcting for random errors inherent in its rainfall forcing data. The performance of this SMAP-based assimilation system is evaluated using two approaches. At global scale, the accuracy of the system is assessed by examining the lagged correlation agreement between soil moisture and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Additional regional-scale evaluation using in situ-based soil moisture estimates is carried out at seven of the SMAP core Cal/Val sites located in the USA. Both types of analysis demonstrate the value of assimilating SMAP into the USDA FAS Palmer model and its potential to enhance operational USDA FAS root-zone soil moisture information.\": 1,\n"," 'Flooding occurs frequently and causes loss of lives, and extensive damages to infrastructure and the environment.

Generally, five sentences are used to describe the RSI in caption datasets. Every sentence can just focus on part of images' contents due to the different attention parts of annotation persons.

In order to consider five sentences together, a collection of words, which named topic words contained common information among five sentences, is jointly incorporated into a captioning model to generate a determinate sentence that covers common contents in RSIs. Instead of employing a naive recurrent neural network, a memory network in which topic words can be naturally included as memory cells is introduced to generate sentences. A novel retrieval topic recurrent memory network is proposed to utilize the topic words. First, a topic repository is built to record the topic words in training datasets.

The Lee sigma method was more suitable for estimating soil moisture (SM) than the other filtering methods under different land cover types. First, we used a combination of roughness and the dual-polarized Sentinel-1A backscattering coefficients (VV and VH) to estimate SM in bare soil areas. Second, we employed water cloud model (WCM) to remove the influence of vegetation signals on the land surface backscattering and estimate SM in vegetation-covered areas. SM was also retrieved by modified soil moisture monitoring index (MSMMI) and modified perpendicular drought index (MPDI) of Sentinel-2A images. The results show that MSMMI can more accurately monitor SM in bare soil areas, which was slightly better than synthetic aperture radar (SAR) results. The SAR backscattering coefficients after the removal of vegetation influence by WCM can more precisely estimate SM in vegetation-covered areas, which is significantly better than MSMMI and MPDI, especially in high vegetation-covered areas. Optics and SAR differ in their abilities to estimate SM under different land cover, but the powerful fitting ability of machine learning can make full use of their advantages. We employed the generalized regression neural network (GRNN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms to estimate SM combining Sentinel-1A with Sentinel-2A images.

However, the retrieval is an ill-posed problem, and thus there are multiple thermodynamic solutions that might satisfy the observed radiances. Previous work developed a physical-iterative method called AERIoe that retrieved temperature and water vapor mixing ratio profiles from these radiance observations in both clear and cloudy conditions. The AERIoe algorithm was modified to enforce two physical constraints, namely that the derived relative humidity must be less than 100% and that the potential temperature must be monotonically increasing with height above some thin potentially subadiabatic layer after each iteration. Furthermore, additional observations including in situ surface meteorology, numerical weather prediction model output, microwave brightness temperatures, and partial profiles of water vapor from a Raman lidar were incorporated into the observation vector of the retrieval along with the infrared radiance observations. The addition of these new observations markedly improved the accuracy of the temperature profiles, especially above 2 km, and the water vapor profiles relative to radiosondes.

This study attempts to detect temporal and spatial changes in LULC patterns of the Chalus watershed during the last two decades using multitemporal Landsat images and predict the future LULC changes and patterns of the Chalus watershed for the year 2040. A hybrid method between segment-based and pixel-based classification was applied for each Landsat image in 2001, 2014, and 2021 to produce LULC maps of the Chalus watershed. In this study, the transition potential maps and the transition probability matrices between LULC types were provided by the support vector machine algorithm and the Markov chain model, respectively, to project the 2021 and 2040 LULC maps.

An example of such an instrument is the Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) full-range spectroradiometer, featuring three spectral detectors to capture spectra between 350 and 2500 nm. The resulting spectra often exhibit radiometric steps at the joints of these detectors. This study investigates the influence of external temperature and humidity on the magnitude of these steps by experiments based on a climate chamber. Relative radiometric errors at the detector borders were found to reach up to 16% for the visible and near infrared and 21% for the shortwave infrared 2 (SWIR2), whereas relative reflectance errors are target dependent, typically ranging between 2% and 6%. The derived sensor model provides a physically based explanation of the changes in radiometry due to temperature and demonstrates that all spectral bands are affected to a higher or lesser degree. The model can be used to correct for the effect of temperature on the recorded radiances.

We use historical crop maps from the agricultural department and North Dakota ground measurements as training datasets. Processing workflows are created to automate the tedious preprocessing, training, testing, and postprocessing workflows. We tested this hybrid solution on new images and received accurate results on major crops such as corn, soybean, barley, spring wheat, dry beans, sugar beets, and alfalfa. The pixelwise overall accuracy in all three test regions is over 82% for all land types (including noncrop land), which is the same level of accuracy as the U.S. Department of Agriculture Cropland Data Layer. The texture of DNN maps is more consistent with fewer noises, which is more comfortable to read. We find DNN is better on recognizing big farmlands than recognizing the scattered wetlands and suburban regions in North Dakota. The model trained on multiple scenes of multiple years and months yields higher accuracy than any of the models trained only on a single scene, a single month, or a single year. These results reflect that DNN can produce reliable in-season maps for major crops in North Dakota big farms and could provide a relatively accurate reference for the minor crops in scattered wetland fields.': 1,\n"," 'Recent advances in deep-learning methods have shown extraordinary performance in road extraction from high resolution satellite imagery. However, most existing deep-learning network models yield discontinuous and incomplete results because of shadows and occlusions. To address this problem, a dual-attention road extraction network (DA-RoadNet) with a certain semantic reasoning ability is proposed. First, DA-RoadNet is designed based on a shallow encoder-to-decoder network with densely connected blocks, which can minimize the loss of road structure information caused by multiple down-sampling operations. Moreover, by constructing a novel attention mechanism module, the proposed network is able to explore and integrate the invisible correlations among road features with their global dependency in spatial and channel dimension respectively. Finally, considering that the proportion of road samples is small in the satellite imagery, a hybrid loss function is appended to handle class imbalance, which enables the network model to train stablely and avoid local optimum. The validation experiments using two open road datasets demonstrate that the proposed DA-RoadNet can effectively solve discontinuous problems and preserve integrity of the extracted roads, thus resulting in a higher accuracy of road extraction compared with other developed state-of-the-arts. The considerable performance on the two challenging benchmarks also proves the powerful generation ability of our method.': 1,\n"," 'A complete and accurate landslide map is necessary for landslide susceptibility and risk assessment.

The convolution is a linear operation, which extracts features from the input data. However, nonlinear operations are able to better characterize the internal relationships and hidden patterns within complex remote sensing data, such as hyperspectral images (HSIs). Morphological operations are powerful nonlinear transformations for feature extraction that preserve the essential characteristics of the image, such as borders, shape, and structural information.

The proposed approach efficiently models nonlinear information during the training process of HSI classification. Specifically, our method includes spectral and spatial morphological blocks to extract relevant features from the HSI input data. These morphological blocks consist of two basic 2-D morphological operators (erosion and dilation) in the respective layers, followed by a weighted combination of the feature maps. Both layers can successfully encode the nonlinear information related to shape and size, playing an important role in classification performance.

The widely used two-step WSSS framework is adopted, in which the pseudo-masks are first produced from image-level labels and followed by a segmentation network trained by the pseudo-masks. In addition, the fully connected conditional random field (CRF) is utilized to explore spatial context in both training and prediction stages. Detailed analyzes are implemented on applying WSSS on HR images in terms of producing pseudo-masks, training segmentation network, and optimizing predictions. We show that the tradeoff between precision and recall of pseudo-masks, as well as the boundary accuracy and the background, needs to be carefully considered. The benefits of the segmentation network in the two-step framework are demonstrated in comparison to using classification network only for WSSS, and the effects of CRF-loss are identified to be powerful for improving the segmentation network while it is not appropriate for dense buildings. An overlapping strategy and CRF postprocessing are further demonstrated to be effective for optimizing the segmentation results during inferencing. Through deliberate settings, we can generate results comparable to fully supervised on the ISPRS Potsdam and Vaihingen dataset, which is meaningful for promoting WSSS applications for extracting geographic information from HR images.': 1,\n"," 'In the convolutional neural network, the precise segmentation of small-scale objects and object boundaries in remote sensing images is a great challenge. As the model gets deeper, low-level features with geometric information and high-level features with semantic information cannot be obtained simultaneously. To alleviate this problem, a successive pooling attention network (SPANet) was proposed. The SPANet mainly consists of ResNet50 as the backbone, successive pooling attention module (SPAM), and feature fusion module (FFM). Specifically, the SPANet uses two parallel branches to extract high-level features by ResNet50 and low-level features by the first 11 layers of ResNet50. Then, both the high- and low-level features are fed to the SPAM, which is mainly composed of a successive pooling operator and a self-attention submodule, for further extracting deeper multiscale and salient features. In addition, the low- and high-level features after the SPAM are fused by the FFM to achieve the complementarity of spatial and geometric information. This fusion module alleviates the problem of the accurate segmentation of object edges. Finally, the high-level features and enhanced low-level features of the two branches are fused to obtain the final prediction results. Experiments show that the proposed SPANet achieves a good segmentation effect compared with other models on two remotely sensed datasets.': 1,\n"," 'Large-scale geoscience phenomena are increasingly attracting more attention because of their great scientific and social significance. However, many existing earth observation systems lack the ability to conduct long-term continuous observations at a regional-to-global scale because of spatial and temporal coverage limitations and systematic bias. In this work, we propose a new platform, the moon, and discuss its potential and optical geometrical characteristics for observing large-scale geoscience phenomena. Based on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ephemerides, the reference systems transformation and a simulation system of moon-based earth observations were developed. Numerous experiments were carried out and a series of simulation images are presented, which illustrate the wide swath and continuous observation characteristics of such a lunar observatory. In order to quantify the performance of moon-based earth observations, a simplified geometrical model was constructed and data were analyzed. The sublunar points were found to be unique parameters with the ability to characterize the relative positions between moon and earth. We also defined an effective coverage parameter for assessing the optical coverage ability of moon-based earth observations. The calculation showed that the average value of the introduced coverage parameter from 1960 to 2050 was 0.500, and the coverage remained stable in different years. Furthermore, the total daily visible time and repeated times of different positions on the earth surface are analyzed and the effect of different positions on the lunar surface of the observatory are evaluated. The result shows that such a moon-based approach could make significant contributions to the monitoring and understanding of large-scale geoscience phenomena.': 1,\n"," 'A significant quantity of space-borne Global Navigation Satellite Systems-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) data over land was made available in the last decade, leading to an increasing interest in the assessment of the potentialities of this new remote sensing technique for land monitoring. In this frame, an electromagnetic simulator, such as the Soil And VEgetation Reflection Simulator (SAVERS), has the key role to support the understanding of the physical mechanism involved in the bistatic scattering and to identify the surface features mainly contributing to the observed signal. Originally developed for ground and airborne GNSS-R observations over homogeneous areas, in this study, SAVERS was upgraded to account for space-borne systems. The new version of SAVERS takes into account the inhomogeneity characterizing the large area observed from space altitudes, due to a variable surface elevation and land cover. Coherent and incoherent scattering and polarization rotation are computed taking into account the local slope and elevation of the surface. The simulator was validated against TechDemoSat-1 observations over a bare surface with a complex topography and over a forested surface with a gentle topography. The validation results show the capability of SAVERS to correctly estimate the effect of the topography, enhancing the understanding of the observations. Moreover, it was found that the sensitivity to soil moisture is independent of the topography (about 1.5 dB for a 10% variation of soil moisture). Whereas a saturation of the GNSS-R reflectivity over a variable topography is reached for lower values of biomass, earlier than in the flat case.': 1,\n"," \"HydroGNSS (Hydrology using Global Navigation Satellite System reflections) has been selected as the second European Space Agency (ESA) Scout earth observation mission to demonstrate the capability of small satellites to deliver science.

The breakthroughs in deep learning methods represented by convolutional neural network (CNN) models have greatly improved the SAR image recognition accuracy. Classification models based on CNNs can perform high-precision classification, but there are security problems against adversarial examples (AEs). However, the research on AEs is mostly limited to natural images, and remote sensing images (SAR, multispectral, etc.) have not been extensively studied. To explore the basic characteristics of AEs of SAR images (ASIs), we use two classic white-box attack methods to generate ASIs from two SAR image classification datasets and then evaluate the vulnerability of six commonly used CNNs. The results show that ASIs are quite effective in fooling CNNs trained on SAR images, as indicated by the obtained high attack success rate. Due to the structural differences among CNNs, different CNNs present different vulnerabilities in the face of ASIs. We found that ASIs generated by nontarget attack algorithms feature attack selectivity, which is related to the feature space distribution of the original SAR images and the decision boundary of the classification model. We propose the sample-boundary-based AE selectivity distance to successfully explain the attack selectivity of ASIs. We also analyze the effects of image parameters, such as image size and number of channels, on the attack success rate of ASIs through parameter sensitivity. The experimental results of this study provide data support and an effective reference for attacks on and the defense capabilities of various CNNs with regard to AEs in SAR image classification models.': 1,\n"," 'Deriving the extent of areas affected by wildfires is critical to fire management, protection of the population, damage assessment, and better understanding of the consequences of fires. In the past two decades, several algorithms utilizing data from Earth observation satellites have been developed to detect fire-affected areas. However, most of these methods require the establishment of complex functional relationships between numerous remote sensing data parameters. In contrast, more recently, deep learning has found its way into the application, having the advantage of being able to detect patterns in complex data by learning from examples automatically. In this article, a workflow for the detection of fire-affected areas from satellite imagery acquired in the visible, infrared, and microwave domains is described. Using this workflow, the fire detection potentials of four sources of freely available satellite imagery were investigated: the C-SAR instrument on board Sentinel-1, the multispectral instrument on board Sentinel-2, the sea and land surface temperature instrument on board Sentinel-3, and the MODIS instrument on board Terra and Aqua. For each of them, a single-input convolutional neural network based on the well-known U-Net architecture was trained on a newly created dataset. The performance of the resulting four single-instrument models was evaluated in presence of clouds and in clear conditions. In addition, the potential of combining predictions from pairs of single-instrument models was investigated. The results show that fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 data provides the best detection rate in clear conditions, whereas the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data shows a significant benefit in cloudy weather.': 1,\n"," 'Accurate large-scale building detection is significant in monitoring urban development, map updating, change detection, and digital city establishment. However, due to the complicated details of background objects in high spatial resolution remotely sensed images, the models proposed in building detection are still not performing satisfactorily. Particularly, such issue lies in the small buildings, which are easily to be omitted, and the pixels in the bounding area of each building instance can be especially confusing with the background objects. Aiming to deal with such problem, we propose Res2-Unet to employ multi-scale learning at a granular level, rather than the commonly used layer-wise feature learning, to enlarge the scale of receptive fields of each bottleneck layer. It replaces the widely used 3 \\\\times 3 convolution on n-channel feature maps with a set of smaller groups, which are organized in a hierarchical structure to enlarge the scale-variability. The general framework is an end-to-end learning network, taking a typical semantic segmentation network structure with encoders to encode the input image into feature maps and decoders to decode the feature maps into binary segmented result image. Moreover, to enhance the building boundary generation ability of our model, a boundary loss function is proposed to improve the detection performance. The proposed framework is evaluated on three public datasets, Massachusetts building dataset, WHU East Asia Satellite dataset and WHU Aerial building dataset. It is compared with the published performances and has achieved the state-of-the-art accuracies. That verifies the robustness of the proposed framework.': 1,\n"," 'Deep spectral-spatial features fusion has become a research focus in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, how to extract more robust spectral-spatial features is still a challenging problem. In this article, a novel deep multilayer fusion dense network (MFDN) is proposed to improve the performance of HSI classification. The proposed MFDN simultaneously extracts the spatial and spectral features based on different sample input sizes, which can extract abundant spectral and spatial correlation information. First, the principal component analysis algorithm is performed on hyperspectral data to extract low-dimensional HSI data, and then the spatial features are extracted from the low-dimensional 3-D HSI data through 2-D convolutional, 2-D dense block, and average-pooling layers. Second, the spectral features are extracted directly from the raw 3-D HSI data by means of 3-D convolutional, 3-D dense block, and average-pooling layers. Third, the spatial and spectral features are fused together through 3-D convolutional, 3-D dense block, and average-pooling layers. Finally, the fused spectral-spatial features are sent into two full connection layers to extract high-level abstract features. Furthermore, densely connected structures can help alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and improve the HSI classification accuracy. The proposed fusion network outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods especially with a small number of labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate that it can achieve outstanding hyperspectral classification performance.': 1,\n"," 'Automated water body detection from satellite imagery is a fundamental stage for urban hydrological studies. In recent years, various deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based methods have been proposed to segment remote sensing data collected by conventional RGB or multispectral imagery for such studies.

A data set of 160 elements is created containing landslide and nonlandslide images. The proposed method consists of three steps: augmenting training image samples to increase the volume of the training data; fine-tuning with limited image samples; and performance evaluation of the algorithm in terms of precision, recall, and F1 measure, on the considered landslide images, by adopting ResNet-50 and 101 as backbone models. The experimental results are quite encouraging as the proposed method achieves precision equals to 1.00, recall 0.93, and F1 measure 0.97, when ResNet-101 is used as backbone model, and with a low number of landslide photographs used as training samples. The proposed algorithm can be potentially useful for land-use planners and policymakers of hilly areas where intermittent slope deformations necessitate landslide detection as a prerequisite before planning.': 1,\n"," 'Hyperspectral imaging is unable to acquire images with high resolution in both spatial and spectral dimensions yet, due to physical hardware limitations. It can only produce low spatial resolution images in most cases and thus hyperspectral image (HSI) spatial super-resolution is important. Recently, deep learning-based methods for HSI spatial super-resolution have been actively exploited. However, existing methods do not focus on structural spatial-spectral correlation and global correlation along spectra, which cannot fully exploit useful information for super-resolution. Also, some of the methods are straightforward extension of RGB super-resolution methods, which have fixed number of spectral channels and cannot be generally applied to hyperspectral images whose number of channels varies. Furthermore, unlike RGB images, existing HSI datasets are small and limit the performance of learning-based methods. In this article, we design a bidirectional 3D quasi-recurrent neural network for HSI super-resolution with arbitrary number of bands. Specifically, we introduce a core unit that contains a 3D convolutional module and a bidirectional quasi-recurrent pooling module to effectively extract structural spatial-spectral correlation and global correlation along spectra, respectively. By combining domain knowledge of HSI with a novel pretraining strategy, our method can be well generalized to remote sensing HSI datasets with limited number of training data. Extensive evaluations and comparisons on HSI super-resolution demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods, in terms of both restoration accuracy and visual quality.': 1,\n"," 'The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory will carry a Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) consisting of a Ku-band precipitation radar (KuPR) and a Ka-band precipitation radar (KaPR). In this study, “at-launch” codes of DPR precipitation algorithms, which will be used in GPM ground systems at launch, were evaluated using synthetic data based upon the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) data. Results from the codes (Version 4.20131010) of the KuPR-only, KaPR-only, and DPR algorithms were compared with “true values” calculated based upon drop size distributions assumed in the synthetic data and standard results from the TRMM algorithms at an altitude of 2 km over the ocean. The results indicate that the total precipitation amounts during April 2011 from the KuPR and DPR algorithms are similar to the true values, whereas the estimates from the KaPR data are underestimated. Moreover, the DPR estimates yielded smaller precipitation rates for rates less than about 10 mm/h and greater precipitation rates above 10 mm/h. Underestimation of the KaPR estimates was analyzed in terms of measured radar reflectivity (Z m ) of the KaPR at an altitude of 2 km. The underestimation of the KaPR data was most pronounced during strong precipitation events of Z m <; 18 dBZ (high attenuation cases) over heavy precipitation areas in the Tropics, whereas the underestimation was less pronounced when the Z m > 26 (moderate attenuation cases). The results suggest that the underestimation is caused by a problem in the attenuation correction method, which was verified by the improved codes.': 1,\n"," 'This article proposes a global prototypical network (GPN) to solve the problem of hyperspectral image classification using limited supervised samples (i.e., few-shot problem). In the proposed method, a strategy of global representation learning is adopted to train a network (f θ ) to transfer the samples from the original data space to an embedding-feature space. In the new feature space, a vector called global prototypical representation for each class is learned. In terms of the network (f θ ), we designed an architecture of a deep network consisting of a dense convolutional network and the spectral-spatial attention network. For the classification, the similarities between the unclassified samples and the global prototypical representation of each class are evaluated and the classification is finished by nearest neighbor classifier. Several public hyperspectral images were utilized to verify the proposed GPN. The results showed that the proposed GPN obtained the better overall accuracy compared with existing methods. In addition, the time expenditure of the proposed GPN was similar with several existing popular methods. In conclusion, the proposed GPN in this article is state-of-the-art for solving the problem of hyperspectral image classification using limited supervised samples.': 1,\n"," 'The performance of remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) systems depends on the capability of the extracted features in characterizing the semantic content of images. Existing RSIR systems describe images by visual descriptors that model the primitives (such as different land-cover classes) present in the images. However, the visual descriptors may not be sufficient to describe the high-level complex content of RS images (e.g., attributes and relationships among different land-cover classes). To address this issue, in this article, we present an RSIR system that aims at generating and exploiting textual descriptions to accurately describe the relationships between the objects and their attributes present in RS images with captions (i.e., sentences). To this end, the proposed retrieval system consists of three main steps. The first step aims to encode the image visual features and then translate the encoded features into a textual description that summarizes the content of the image with captions. This is achieved based on the combination of a convolutional neural network with a recurrent neural network. The second step aims to convert the generated textual descriptions into semantically meaningful feature vectors. This is achieved by using the recent word embedding techniques. Finally, the last step estimates the similarity between the vectors of the textual descriptions of the query image and those of the archive images, and then retrieve the most similar images to the query image. Experimental results obtained on two different datasets show that the description of the image content with captions in the framework of RSIR leads to an accurate retrieval performance.': 1,\n"," 'Field spectroscopy is increasingly used in various fields of science: either as a research tool in its own right or in support of airborne- or space-based optical instruments for calibration or validation purposes.

Furthermore, this study found that the distribution of the crops in Qinghai is associated with climate, topography, and cultivation habits.': 1,\n"," 'The first of two Sentinel-2 satellites, launched mid2015, has similar characteristics as the Landsat TM/ETM + /OLI satellites. Together, these satellites will produce a tremendous quantity of optical images worldwide for glacier mapping, with increasing temporal coverage toward the more glacierized higher latitudes due to convergence of near-polar orbits. To exploit the potential of such near-future dense time series, methods for mapping glaciers from space should be revisited. Currently, snow and ice are typically classified from an optical satellite image using a multispectral band ratio. For each scene, mapping conditions will vary (e.g., snow, ice, and clouds) and not be equally optimal over the entire scene. The increasing amount of images makes it difficult to manually select the best glacier mapping scene as is the current practice. This work is based on the above robust image ratio method for exploiting the dense temporal image coverage. Four application scenarios using time series of Landsat type data for glacier mapping are presented. First, we synthesize an optimal band ratio image from a stack of images within one season to compensate for regional differences. The second application scenario introduces robust methods to improve automatic glacier mapping by exploiting the seasonal variation in spectral properties of snow. Third, we explore the spatio-temporal variation of glacier surface types. Finally, we show how the synthesized band ratio images from the first application scenario can be used for automatic glacier change detection. In summary, we explore automatic algorithms for glacier mapping applications that exploit the temporal signatures in the satellite data time series.': 1,\n"," 'Water body extraction from remote sensing images is an important task. Deep learning has become a more popular method for extracting water bodies from remote sensing images. However, these methods are usually aimed at a specific sensor and are not applicable.

The mixup operation is used to enhance the spatial mixed data of remote sensing images, and the discrete sample space is rendered continuous to improve the smoothness in the neighborhood of the data space. The characteristics of multiscale surface objects are extracted, and their internal dense connection is strengthened by the densely connected backbone network. GCSA is introduced into the densely connected backbone network to encode the context information of the remote sensing scene image into the local features. Experiments were performed on four remote sensing scene datasets to evaluate the performance of GCSANet. The GCSANet achieved the highest classification precision on AID and NWPU datasets and the second-best performance on the UC Merced dataset, indicating the GCSANet can effectively extract the global features of remote sensing images.

However, current LST products cannot provide a global coverage at a fine spatial resolution (~100 m) over a long period (>30 years). Landsat series satellites that have been launched since 1972 provide a unique opportunity to fill the gap. Here, we proposed a single-channel framework for producing global long time-series Landsat LST retrievals on a Google earth engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. This framework unifies the LST, land surface emissivity (LSE) and atmospheric water vapor (AWV) estimation algorithms, as well as the emissivity and atmospheric input data for the Landsat LST retrievals from the entire Landsat thermal infrared image archive. In situ LST measurements and the MODIS LST products were employed to evaluate Landsat LST retrievals using the proposed framework over land and water surfaces, respectively. In total, 1317 clear-sky LST samples were collected from the Landsat 5-8 series after spatiotemporal registration with seven sites, and the average bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 0.33 and 2.01 K, respectively. Intercomparison between Landsat and MODIS LST retrievals based on 100 clear-sky scenes over 12 inland lakes showed an average bias of 0.17 K and RMSE of 1.11 K. We conclude that the proposed single-channel framework can produce Landsat LST with high accuracy following a simple yet robust way. Implementation of the single-channel method on GEE shows promise in providing the community with freely accessible and global long time-series (>30 years) LST data.': 1,\n"," 'As a unique classification scheme for urban forms and functions, the local climate zone (LCZ) system provides essential general information for any studies related to urban environments, especially on a large scale. Remote sensing data-based classification approaches are the key to large-scale mapping and monitoring of LCZs. The potential of deep learning-based approaches is not yet fully explored, even though advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) continue to push the frontiers for various computer vision tasks. One reason is that published studies are based on different datasets, usually at a regional scale, which makes it impossible to fairly and consistently compare the potential of different CNNs for real-world scenarios. This article is based on the big So2Sat LCZ42 benchmark dataset dedicated to LCZ classification. Using this dataset, we studied a range of CNNs of varying sizes. In addition, we proposed a CNN to classify LCZs from Sentinel-2 images, Sen2LCZ-Net. Using this base network, we propose fusing multilevel features using the extended Sen2LCZ-Net-MF. With this proposed simple network architecture, and the highly competitive benchmark dataset, we obtain results that are better than those obtained by the state-of-the-art CNNs, while requiring less computation with fewer layers and parameters. Large-scale LCZ classification examples of completely unseen areas are presented, demonstrating the potential of our proposed Sen2LCZ-Net-MF as well as the So2Sat LCZ42 dataset.

The model starts by learning from image pairs the normal existing patterns in the before and after images to come up with a suitable representation of the normal (nonchange) class. To achieve this, we employ a stacked sparse autoencoder trained on a large number of temporal image features (training data) in an unsupervised manner. To classify pixels of new unseen image-pairs, the built anomaly detection model reconstructs the input from its representation in the latent space. First, the probe (new) image (i.e., the bitemporal heterogeneous image pair as the input request) is encoded in this compact normal space from a stacked hidden representation. The reconstruction error is computed using the L2 norm in what we call the residual normal space. In which, the nonchange patterns are characterized by small reconstruction errors as a normal class while the change patterns are quantified by high reconstruction errors categorizing the abnormal class. The dichotomic (changed/unchanged) classification map is generated in the residual space by clustering the reconstructed errors using a Gaussian mixture model. Experimental results on different real heterogeneous images, reflecting a mixture of imaging and land surface CD conditions, confirm the robustness of the proposed anomaly detection model.': 1,\n"," \"Nitrogen (N) fertilizer management is one of the main concerns for precision agriculture under corn production, which aims to not only maximize the profits, but also ensure environmental sustainability. Effective N fertilizer management can either avoid N stress or provide timely and accurate detection of in-season N stress for remedies. Traditional N trial experiments to evaluate different N management practices have to wait until harvest, and do not allow tracking of when and how N stress develops. Meanwhile, rapidly developed remote sensing technology offers new opportunities for in-season evaluation of N status and detection of N stress for crops, including both the unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV)-based and satellite-based multispectral sensing. In this study, we collected weekly multispectral images of UAV and Planet Lab's CubeSat, as well as various other ground measurements for an experimental cornfield that included 28 N management treatments in Central Illinois, 2017. We found that both the UAV- and CubeSat-based multispectral sensors were able to detect N stress at vegetative stages before tasseling, and could detect changes in the level of N stress through derived chlorophyll index green (CIg) for different N management practices. The CubeSat-based CIg showed high consistency with the UAV-based CIg (correlation above 0.9), which indicated the potential of CubeSat-based CIg to be applied for N stress detection at a larger spatial scale. This study demonstrates that the UAV- and CubeSat-based multispectral sensing has the promising potential to monitor N stress of corn throughout the growing season, which may assist decision making of N management.\": 1,\n"," 'Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have outstanding advantages in the classification of remote sensing scenes. Deep CNN models with better classification performance typically have high complexity, whereas shallow CNN models with low complexity rarely achieve good classification performance for remote sensing images with complex spatial structures. In this article, we proposed a new lightweight CNN classification method based on branch feature fusion (LCNN-BFF) for remote sensing scene classification. In contrast to a conventional single linear convolution structure, the proposed model had a bilinear feature extraction structure. The BFF method was utilized to fuse the feature information extracted from the two branches, which improved the classification accuracy. In addition, combining depthwise separable convolution and conventional convolution to extract image features greatly reduced the complexity of the model on the premise of ensuring the accuracy of classification. We tested the method on four standard datasets. The experimental results showed that, compared with recent classification methods, the number of weight parameters of the proposed method only accounted for less than 5% of the other methods; however, the classification accuracy was equivalent to or even superior to certain high-performance classification methods.': 1,\n"," 'In the course of global urbanization, poverty in cities has been observed to increase, especially in the Global South.

Large-scale slum mapping remains a challenge, fuzzy feature spaces between formal and informal settlements, significant imbalance of slum occurrences opposed to formal settlements, and various categories of multiple morphological slum features. We propose a transfer learned fully convolutional Xception network (XFCN), which is able to differentiate between formal built-up structures and the various categories of slums in high-resolution satellite data. The XFCN is trained on a large sample of globally distributed slums, located in cities of Cape Town, Caracas, Delhi, Lagos, Medellin, Mumbai, Nairobi, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Shenzhen. Slums in these cities are greatly heterogeneous inits morphological feature space and differ to a varying degree to formal settlements. Transfer learning can help to improve segmentation results when learning on a variety of slum morphologies, with high F1 scores of up to 89%.': 1,\n"," 'The content-based remote sensing image retrieval (CBRSIR) has recently become a hot topic due to its wide applications in analysis of remote sensing data. However, since conventional CBRSIR is unsuitable in harsh environments, this article focuses on the cross-modality CBRSIR (CM-CBRSIR) between synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images. Besides the large interclass and small intraclass in CBRSIR, CM-CBRSIR is limited by prominent modality discrepancy caused by different imaging mechanisms. To address this limitation, this study proposes a deep cross-modality hashing network. First, we transform optical images with three channels into four different types of single-channel images to increase diversity of the training modalities. This helps the network to mainly focus on extracting the contour and texture shared features and makes it less sensitive to color information for images across modalities. Second, we combine any type of randomly selected transformed images and its corresponding SAR or optical images to form image pairs that are fed into the networks. The training strategy, with paired image data, eliminates the large cross-modality variations caused by different modalities. Finally, the triplet loss, in combination with the hash function, helps the modal to extract the discriminative features of images and upgrade the retrieval efficiency. To further evaluate the proposed modality, we construct a SAR-optical dual-modality remote sensing image dataset containing 12 categories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method with regards to efficiency and generality.': 1,\n"," 'We present in this work a first performance assessment of the Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) algorithm, for the generation of Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry (DInSAR) deformation maps and time series, which has been migrated to a Cloud Computing (CC) environment. In particular, we investigate the scalable performances of the P-SBAS algorithm by processing a selected ENVISAT ASAR image time series, which we use as a benchmark, and by exploiting the Amazon Web Services (AWS) CC platform. The presented analysis shows a very good match between the theoretical and experimental P-SBAS performances achieved within the CC environment. Moreover, the obtained results demonstrate that the implemented P-SBAS Cloud migration is able to process ENVISAT SAR image time series in short times (less than 7 h) and at low costs (about USD 200). The P-SBAS Cloud scalable performances are also compared to those achieved by exploiting an in-house High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, showing that nearly no overhead is introduced by the presented Cloud solution. As a further outcome, the performed analysis allows us to identify the major bottlenecks that can hamper the P-SBAS performances within a CC environment, in the perspective of processing very huge SAR data flows such as those coming from the existing COSMO-SkyMed or the upcoming SENTINEL-1 constellation. This work represents a relevant step toward the challenging Earth Observation scenario focused on the joint exploitation of advanced DInSAR techniques and CC environments for the massive processing of Big SAR Data.': 1,\n"," 'Hyperspectral imaging has been emerged as a new generation of technology for earth observation and space exploration since the beginning of this millennium and widely used in various disciplinary and applications. The fascinating detailed spectral information acquired by hyperspectral imagers often yields results not possible with multispectral or other types of satellites. This article provides an overview of spaceborne hyperspectral imagers, technology evolution, and development history. After introduction of hyperspectral satellites, it first describes the principle of hyperspectral imaging. It then reviews the history of hyperspectral technology development, starting from the first airborne hyperspectral imager AIS built in early 1980s, the first operational airborne hyperspectral imager AVIRIS developed since middle 1980s, the first commercial airborne hyperspectral instrument CASI fabricated since late 1980s, followed by the development of hyperspectral technology in Canada between 1980s and 1990s, and the NASA planned orbiting hyperspectral imagers in 1990s, until the first spaceborne hyperspectral imager Hyperion launched in 2000. This article summarizes the survey carried out by the author on spaceborne hyperspectral imagers to date. There exist at least 25 hyperspectral imagers that have been deployed into space. Among them, 19 are aboard satellites orbiting earth. Six of them are out of earth orbits for Moon, Mars, Venus, and comet missions. The article briefly describes these spaceborne hyperspectral imagers and their mission objectives with the focus on the instrument performance parameters and technical features. This article also briefly reviews six upcoming spaceborne hyperspectral imagers, including EnMAP, MAJIS, OCI, HyspIRI, FLORIS, and CHIME.': 1,\n"," 'Fast and stable detection of dim and small infrared (IR) targets in complex backgrounds has important practical significance for IR search and tracking system. The existing small IR target detection methods usually fail or cause a high probability of false alarm in the highly heterogeneous and complex backgrounds. Continuous motion of a target relative to the background is important information regarding detection. In this article, a low-rank and sparse decomposition method based on greedy bilateral factorization is proposed for IR dim and small target detection. First, by analyzing the complex structure information of IR image sequences, the target is regarded as an independent sparse motion structure and an efficient optimization algorithm is designed. Second, the greedy bilateral factorization strategy is adopted to approximate the low-rank part of the algorithm, which significantly accelerates the efficiency of the algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has better detection performance than the existing methods. The proposed method can still detect targets quickly and stably especially in complex scenes with weak signal-to-noise ratio.': 1,\n"," 'The development of remote sensing images in recent years has made it possible to identify materials in inaccessible environments and study natural materials on a large scale. But hyperspectral images (HSIs) are a rich source of information with their unique features in various applications. However, several problems reduce the accuracy of HSI classification; for example, the extracted features are not effective, noise, the correlation of bands, and most importantly, the limited labeled samples. To improve accuracy in the case of limited training samples, we propose a multiscale dual-branch residual spectral–spatial network with attention to the HSI classification model named MDBRSSN in this article. First, due to the correlation and redundancy between HSI bands, a principal component analysis operation is applied to preprocess the raw HSI data. Then, in MDBRSSN, a dual-branch structure is designed to extract the useful spectral–spatial features of HSI. The advanced feature, multiscale abstract information extracted by the convolution neural network, is applied to image processing, which can improve complex hyperspectral data classification accuracy. In addition, the attention mechanisms applied separately to each branch enable MDBRSSN to optimize and refine the extracted feature maps. Such an MDBRSSN framework can learn and fuse deeper hierarchical spectral–spatial features with fewer training samples. The purpose of designing the MDBRSSN model is to have high classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods when the training samples are limited, which is proved by the results of the experiments in this article on four datasets. In Salinas, Pavia University, Indian Pines, and Houston 2013, the proposed model obtained 99.64%, 98.93%, 98.17%, and 96.57% overall accuracy using only 1%, 1%, 5%, and 5% of labeled data for training, respectively, which are much better compared to the state-of-the-art methods.': 1,\n"," 'Precipitation nowcasting is an important task, which can serve numerous applications such as urban alert and transportation. Previous studies leverage convolutional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address the problem. However, they all suffer from two inherent drawbacks of the convolutional RNN, namely, the lack of a memory cell to preserve the fine-grained spatial appearances and the position misalignment issue when combining current observations with previous hidden states. In this article, we aim to overcome the defects. Specifically, we propose a novel pseudo flow spatiotemporal LSTM unit (PFST-LSTM), where a spatial memory cell and a position alignment module are developed and embedded in the structure of LSTM. Upon the PFST-LSTM units, we develop a new sequence-to-sequence architecture for precipitation nowcasting, which can effectively combine the spatial appearances and motion information. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted on synthetic MovingMNIST++ and CIKM AnalytiCup 2017 datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PFST-LSTM over the state-of-the-art competitors.

Many deep learning based methods have been developed in the past few years. However, since there are no intended HR MS images as references for learning, almost all of the existing methods downsample the MS and PAN images and regard the original MS images as targets to form a supervised setting for training. These methods may perform well on the down-scaled images; however, they generalize poorly to the full-resolution images. To conquer this problem, we design an unsupervised framework that is able to learn directly from the full-resolution images without any preprocessing. The model is built based on a novel generative multiadversarial network. We use a two-stream generator to extract the modality-specific features from the PAN and MS images, respectively, and develop a dual discriminator to preserve the spectral and spatial information of the inputs when performing fusion. Furthermore, a novel loss function is introduced to facilitate training under the unsupervised setting. Experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 images demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain much better fusion results on the full-resolution images.

The first formation flying radar system was built by extending the TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mission by a second, TerraSAR-X-like satellite TanDEM-X. The resulting large single-pass SAR interferometer features flexible baseline selection, enabling the acquisition of highly accurate cross-track interferograms not impacted by temporal decorrelation and atmospheric disturbances. The primary objective of the mission was the generation of a global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with unprecedented accuracy (12-m horizontal resolution and 2-m relative height accuracy). The main mission phase for DEM data acquisition has been finished in 2014; the processing of the global TanDEM-X DEM was concluded in September 2016. The final DEM product is well within specifications and features an extremely low percentage of void areas. It is of fundamental importance for a wide range of commercial and scientific applications. But the scientific exploitation of TanDEM-X is not limited to the DEM. TanDEM-X has unique capabilities, including along-track interferometry, and new bistatic and multistatic SAR techniques, that support numerous secondary mission objectives. Indeed, some of these experiments were directly performed during the DEM acquisition phase, when suitable satellite formation geometries were available. Moreover, regular acquisitions over selected super test sites enabled multitemporal analyses. A dedicated science phase after the DEM acquisitions included up to 4 km cross-track baselines, operation in the so-called Dual-Receive Antenna mode, as well as a period in pursuit monostatic flight formation. Comparisons of the TanDEM-X DEM with that of SRTM, or among multitemporal TanDEM-X data, revealed dramatic, ongoing, changes in Earth's topography, especially over ice and forests. In the last 3.5 years the mission has further acquired data for a global change layer showing the height changes relative to the first global DEM dataset. The so-called “Change DEM” is planned for release in 2021. Despite being well beyond their design lifetime, both satellites are still fully functional and have enough consumables for several additional years. Therefore, bistatic operations continue with a focus on changes in the cryosphere, biosphere, and densely populated urban areas.\": 1,\n"," 'Classification techniques applied to hyperspectral images are very useful for lithologic discrimination and geological mapping. Classifiers are often applied either to all spectral channels or only to absorption spectral channels. However, it is difficult to obtain different lithology information using specific absorption regions from the narrow bandwidth and contiguous spectral channels due to spectral variability among rocks. In this article, we propose a band selection (BS) method for hyperspectral lithologic discrimination, in which the lithological superpixels are first gathered. A spectral bands selection criterion is learned by measuring the homogeneity and the variation of the lithological superpixels, and lithologic discriminating bands are identified by an efficient clustering algorithm based on affinity propagation. In this article, two geologic test sites, i.e., the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer data of the Cuprite, Nevada, USA, including 11 lithologic units (9 types of rocks) and the Hyperion data of Junggar, China, with 5 lithologic units, are chosen for validation. The performance of the proposed BS method is compared with those of using all the bands, specific absorption spectral channels, and two literature BS techniques. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves mapping accuracy by selecting fewer bands with higher lithologic discrimination capability than the other considered methods.': 1,\n"," 'In planetary science, it is an important basic work to recognize and classify the features of topography and geomorphology from the massive data of planetary remote sensing. Therefore, this article proposes a lightweight model based on VGG-16, which can selectively extract some features of remote sensing images, remove redundant information, and recognize and classify remote sensing images. This model not only ensures the accuracy, but also reduces the parameters of the model. According to our experimental results, our model has a great improvement in remote sensing image classification, from the original accuracy of 85%-98% now. At the same time, the model has a great improvement in convergence speed and classification performance. By inputting the remote sensing image data of ultra-low pixels (64 * 64) into our model, we prove that our model still has a high accuracy rate of 95% for the remote sensing image with ultra-low pixels and less feature points. Therefore, the model has a good application prospect in remote sensing image fine classification, very low pixel, and less image classification.': 1,\n"," 'This paper investigates the benefits of integrating multibaseline polarimetric interferometric SAR (PolInSAR) data with LiDAR measurements using a machine-learning approach in order to obtain improved forest canopy height estimates. Multiple interferometric baselines are required to ensure consistent height retrieval performance across a broad range of tree heights. Previous studies have proposed multibaseline merging strategies using metrics extracted from PolInSAR measurements. Here, we introduce the multibaseline merging using a support vector machine trained by sparse LiDAR samples. The novelty of this method lies in the new way of combining the two datasets. Its advantage is that it does not require a complete LiDAR coverage, but only sparse LiDAR samples distributed over the PolInSAR image. LiDAR samples are not used to obtain the best height among a set of height stacks, but rather to train the retrieval algorithm in selecting the best height using the variables derived through PolInSAR processing. This enables more accurate height estimation for a wider scene covered by the SAR with only partial LiDAR coverage. We test our approach on NASA AfriSAR data acquired over tropical forests by the L-band UAVSAR and the LVIS LiDAR instruments. The estimated height from this approach has a higher accuracy (r 2 = 0.81, RMSE = 7.1 m) than previously introduced multibaseline merging approach (r 2 = 0.67, RMSE = 9.2 m). This method is beneficial to future spaceborne missions, such as GEDI and BIOMASS, which will provide a wealth of near-contemporaneous LiDAR samples and PolInSAR measurements for mapping forest structure at global scale.': 1,\n"," 'Radar maneuvering target detection in clutter background should not only consider the complex characteristics of the target to accumulate its energy as much as possible, but also suppress clutter to improve the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR). The traditional fractional domain transform-based detection method requires parameters match searching, which costs heavy computational burden in case of a large amount of data. Sparse FT and sparse fractional FT can obtain high-resolution sparse representation of the target, but the signal sparsity needs to be known before, and the sparse representation performance is poor in clutter background. In this article, adaptive filtering method is introduced into the sparse fractional ambiguity function (SFRAF) method, and a SFRAF domain adaptive clutter suppression and highly maneuvering target detection algorithm is proposed, which is named as adaptive SFRAF (ASFRAF). The ASFRAF domain iterative filtering operation can suppress the clutter while retaining the signal energy as much as possible. Simulation results and measured radar data processing results show that the proposed algorithm can overcome the limitation of the SFRAF on the sparsity preset value and achieve high efficiency and robust detection of high-order phase maneuvering targets under a low SCR environment.': 1,\n"," 'In recent years, despite the tremendous progresses of object detection, small object detection has always been a challenge in the field of remote sensing. The main reason is that small objects cover few features that are easily lost during down-sampling. In this article, we propose a cross-layer attention network aiming to obtain stronger features of small objects for better detection. Specifically, we designed an up-sampling and down-sampling feature pyramid to obtain richer context information by bidirectionally fusing deep and shallow features, as well as skipping connections. Moreover, a cross-layer attention module is designed to obtain the nonlocal association of small objects in each layer, and further strengthen its representation ability through cross-layer integration and balance. Extensive experiments on the publicly available datasets (DIOR dataset and NWPUVHR-10 dataset) and the self-assembled datasets (SDOTA dataset and SDD dataset) show the excellent performance of our method compared with other detectors. Moreover, our method achieved 74.3% mAP on the public DIOR dataset without any tricks.': 1,\n"," 'As two different tools for earth observation, the optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images can provide complementary information of the same land types for better land cover classification. However, because of the different imaging mechanisms of optical and SAR images, how to efficiently exploit the complementary information becomes an interesting and challenging problem. In this article, we propose a novel multimodal bilinear fusion network (MBFNet), which is used to fuse the optical and SAR features for land cover classification. The MBFNet consists of three components: the feature extractor, the second-order attention-based channel selection module (SACSM), and the bilinear fusion module. First, in order to avoid the network parameters tempting to ingratiate dominant modality, the pseudo-siamese convolutional neural network (CNN) is taken as the feature extractor to extract deep semantic feature maps of optical and SAR images, respectively. Then, the SACSM is embedded into each stream, and the fine channel-attention maps with second-order statistics are obtained by bilinear integrating the global average-pooling and global max-pooling information. The SACSM can not only automatically highlight the important channels of feature maps to improve the representation power of networks, but also uses the channel selection mechanism to reconfigure compact feature maps with better discrimination. Finally, the bilinear pooling is used as the feature-level fusion method, which establishes the second-order association between two compact feature maps of the optical and SAR streams to obtain the low-dimension bilinear fusion features for land cover classification. Experimental results on three broad coregistered optical and SAR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves more effective land cover classification performance than the state-of-the-art methods.': 1,\n"," 'Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is regarded as an effective technology for high-spatial resolution (HSR) image classification due to its clear and intuitive technical process. However, OBIA depends on the manual tuning of image classification features, which is a tricky job. Deep learning (DL) technology autolearns image features from massive images and obtains higher image classification accuracy than traditional techniques. In this article, a novel method called object-scale adaptive convolutional neural network (OSA-CNN), which combines OBIA with CNN, is proposed for HSR image classification. First, OSA-CNN collects the image patches along the main axes of the object primitives obtained through image segmentation; the size of the former is automatically determined through the axis widths of the latter. This step generates the input units required for the CNN classification. Second, the Squeeze-and-Excitation block is extracted from the SE network into the network structure of GoogleNet, which realizes the weighted fusion of the multiscale convolutional features, enhances useful features, and suppresses useless ones. In the classification stage, multiscale image segmentation and CNN classification are fused using an object-scale adaptive mechanism. Finally, object primitives are classified through majority voting on the image patches. The network structure modifications, multiscale classification fusion, and other improvements are verified by gradually incorporating these steps into the original GoogleNet. The experiments show that these improvements effectively enhance the image classification accuracy. This article presents an effective way of combining OBIA and DL techniques to utilize the advantages of both approaches and facilitate HSR image classification.': 1,\n"," 'The Sentinel-1 mission provides a freely accessible opportunity for urban image interpretation based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with a specific resolution, which is of paramount importance for Earth observation. In parallel, with the rapid development of advanced technologies, especially deep learning, we urgently need a large-scale SAR dataset supporting urban image interpretation. This article presents OpenSARUrban: a Sentinel-1 dataset dedicated to the content-related interpretation of urban SAR images, including a well-defined hierarchical annotation scheme, data collection, well-established procedures for dataset compilation and organization as well as properties, visualizations, and applications of this dataset.

These properties guarantee the achievement of several goals for OpenSARUrban. The first one is to support urban target characterization. The second one is to help develop well-applicable and advanced algorithms for Sentinel-1 urban target classification. The third one is to explore content-based image retrieval for these kinds of data. In addition, dataset visualization is implemented from the perspective of manifolds to give an intuitive understanding.

In conclusion, the SCA instrument innovations are well set to provide timely benefits in all the main application areas of the scatterometer (winds, soil moisture, sea ice) and can be expected to contribute to new and more sophisticated meteorological, oceanographic, land, sea ice, and climate services in the forthcoming SCA era.': 1,\n"," \"The strong temporal backscatter signature of rice growing above the water's surface allows for the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for paddy rice crop mapping in Southern Vietnam (Mekong Delta). In Northern Vietnam (Red River Delta), rice mapping using SAR is a challenge and is rarely performed because of the complex land-use/land-cover. Nevertheless, information about rice fields is needed for hydrological simulations in river basins such as the Cau River basin. The objective of this research is to investigate the potential of RADARSAT-2 band- C in identifying rice fields over a large and fragmented land-use area. Two methods are proposed, one for each data type, adapted to the land-use/land-cover of the study area. The thresholding technique, with a statistical analysis of the temporal variation of rice backscattering, was applied to the HH like-polarized ratio of dual-pol data. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was applied to the full quad-pol and a single HH-polarization calculated from polarimetric data. This study demonstrates that RADARSAT-2 dual- and quad-pol data can be successfully used to identify cultivated rice fields. However, the dual-pol data seems less efficient than the quad-pol data and the SVM classification is more flexible than the thresholding technique. Between the full quad-pol and a single polarization, the overall classification accuracy shows that the results derived from the single HH polarization are 3 to 10% less accurate than those derived from the classification of full quad-pol data. The results show the usefulness of polarimetric C-band data for the identification of rice fields in Northern Vietnam.\": 1,\n"," 'The recognition and mapping of landslide (RML) is an important task in hazard and risk research and can provide a scientific basis for the prevention and control of landslide disasters. However, traditional RML methods are inefficient, costly, and not intuitive. With the rapid development of computer vision, methods based on convolutional neural networks have attracted great attention due to their numerous advantages. However, problems such as insufficient feature extraction, excessive parameters, and slow model testing have restricted the development of this technology. This research proposes a new RML framework based on a new semantic segmentation network termed the fully convolutional DenseNet (FC-DenseNet). In this network, the features extracted from each layer are repeatedly used in a dense connection, and the parameters are controlled by a bottle-neck structure. Meanwhile, the structure of the encoder-decoder solves the problem of the slowness of model testing. Finally, the landslide influencing factors are added, which enriches the training data. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we focused on several deep networks for comparison and analysis. The results show that FC-DenseNet can better recognize the boundary and interior of landslides, and there are fewer missing and excessive recognition results.

The EQIL inventories are generated mostly by the traditional or semisupervised mapping approaches, which required a parameter's tuning or binary threshold decision in the practical application. In this study, we investigated the impact of optical data from the PlanetScope sensor and topographic factors from the ALOS sensor on EQIL mapping using a deep-learning convolution neural network (CNN). Thus, six training datasets were prepared and used to evaluate the performance of the CNN model using only optical data and using these data along with each and all topographic factors across the west coast of the Trishuli river in Nepal. For the first time, the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) model was applied for combining the resulting maps from each CNN stream that trained with different datasets. Finally, seven different resulting maps were compared against a detailed and accurate inventory of landslide polygons by a mean intersection-over-union (mIOU). Our results confirm that using the training dataset of the spectral information along with the topographic factor of the slope is helpful to distinguish the landslide bodies from other similar features, such as barren lands, and consequently increases the mapping accuracy. The improvement of the mIOU was a range from approximately zero to more than 17%.

Research shows an increasing trend in baseflow and streamflow in the midwest over the last 60 years, which may be related to artificial drainage. Subsurface drainage (i.e., tile) in particular may have strongly contributed to the increase in these flows, because of its extensive use and recent gain in the popularity as a yield-enhancement practice. However, how evapotranspiration (ET) is impacted by tile drainage on a regional level is not well-documented. To explore spatial and temporal ET patterns and their relationship to tile drainage, we applied an energy balance-based multisensor data fusion method to estimate daily 30-m ET over an intensively tile-drained area in South Dakota, USA, from 2005 to 2013. Results suggest that tile drainage slightly decreases the annual cumulative ET, particularly during the early growing season. However, higher mid-season crop water use suppresses the extent of the decrease of the annual cumulative ET that might be anticipated from widespread drainage. The regional water balance analysis during the growing season demonstrates good closure, with the average residual from 2005 to 2012 as low as -3 mm. As an independent check of the simulated ET at the regional scale, the water balance analysis lends additional confidence to the study. The results of this study improve our understanding of the influence of agricultural drainage practices on regional ET, and can affect future decision making regarding tile drainage systems.': 1,\n"," \"Robust and effective detection of a small target in an infrared maritime image is a key technology of maritime target search and tracking applications. Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to the factors such as dim small targets and various complex backgrounds caused by sun glitters and strong waves. In this article, the integrated target saliency measure (ITSM) based on local and nonlocal spatial information is proposed to improve target detection performance. We combine local heterogeneity property of targets and nonlocal self-correlation property of background with targets' sparsity to separate real targets from background clutters. First, local heterogeneity calculation based on cross-window standard deviation (CSD) is proposed to extract candidate targets preliminarily, which enhances the local intensity difference between small targets and neighboring background. Meanwhile, low-rank representation (LRR) is applied to background prediction and removal, which is followed by adaptive threshold segmentation to enhance target saliency. Finally, we integrate the results obtained from the two steps mentioned above to further enhance targets and suppress background clutters. Then, real targets are extracted by an iterative threshold on the integrated map so as to generate the seed map, in addition, the target expansion strategy is exploited to keep full target areas. Experimental results on six datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and target detection accuracy.\": 1,\n"," 'Satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) is an emerging technique to monitor the stability and health of line-infrastructure assets, such as railways, dams, and pipelines.

This is a problem for operational asset managers, who are used to surveying techniques that provide results with uniform quality at predefined locations. Therefore, advanced integrated products and generic performance assessment metrics are necessary. Here, we propose several new monitoring products and quality metrics for a-priori and a-posteriori performance assessment using multisensor InSAR. These products and metrics are demonstrated on a 125 km railway line-infrastructure asset in the Netherlands.': 1,\n"," 'Object tracking is one of the most important components in numerous applications of computer vision. Remote sensing videos provided by commercial satellites make it possible to extend this topic into the earth observation domain. In satellite videos, typical moving targets like vehicles and planes only cover a small area of pixels, and they could easily be confused with surrounding complex ground scenes. Similar objects nearby in satellite videos can hardly be differed by appearance details due to the resolution constraint. Thus, tracking drift caused by distractions is also a thorny problem. Facing challenges, traditional tracking methods such as correlation filters with hand-crafted visual features achieve unsatisfactory results in satellite videos. Methods based on deep neural networks have demonstrated their superiority in various ordinary visual tracking benchmarks, but their results on satellite videos remain unexplored. In this article, deep learning technologies are applied to object tracking in satellite videos for better performance. A simple regression network is used to combine a regression model with convolutional layers and a gradient descent algorithm. The regression network fully exploits the abundant background context to learn a robust tracker. Instead of handcrafted features, both appearance features and motion features, which are extracted by pretrained deep neural networks, are used for accurate object tracking. In cases when the tracker encounters ambiguous appearance information, the motion features could provide complementary and discriminative information to improve tracking performances. Experimental results on various satellite videos show that the proposed method achieves better tracking performance than other state-of-the-arts.': 1,\n"," 'The analytical description of the topside ionosphere included in the NeQuick model is studied in detail. First, the modeled scale height behavior is analyzed at infinity and for the lowest part of the topside region; in the latter case, the analysis is done through an expansion in Taylor series near the F2-layer peak. Moreover, the significant influence of the three NeQuick topside parameters in the modeling of the topside profile is investigated in detail and, in particular, it is shown that for the lowest part of the topside the model assumes a linearly increasing trend of the topside scale height. Second, the topside formulation is inverted to derive a fully analytical expression of the topside scale height as a function of the electron density and F2-layer peak parameters. This expression has been applied to a selected and very reliable dataset of Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC)/FORMOSAT-3 radio occultation profiles. Statistical analyses strongly support the hypothesis embedded in NeQuick regarding the linear trend of the topside scale height for the lowest part of the topside.': 1,\n"," 'Forest cover is a crucial factor that influences the performance of optical satellite-based snow cover monitoring algorithms.

These algorithms were evaluated over test sites located in the forested mountainous landscape of the Pyrenees in Spain and the Sierra Nevada in the USA. Over the Pyrenees site, the effectiveness of snow cover detection was evaluated with respect to a time-series of in situ snow depth measurements logged over test plots with different aspects, canopy cover, and solar irradiance. Over the Sierra Nevada site, the impact of ground vegetation was assessed over the under canopy fractional snow cover retrievals using airborne lidar-derived fractional vegetation cover information. The analyses over the Pyrenees indicated a good accuracy of snow detection with the exception of plots with either dense canopy cover or insufficient solar exposure (shaded forested slope), or both. The operational HRSI algorithm yielded similar performances (25-30% RMSE) as the computationally intensive spectral unmixing approach while retrieving the subcanopy ground FSC over the Sierra Nevada site. It was observed that a more accurate lidar-derived tree cover density map did not improve the subcanopy FSC retrievals.': 1,\n"," 'In this paper, we report the outcomes of the 2015 data fusion contest organized by the Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee (IADF TC) of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society.

Recently, space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is being considered to accurately monitor maritime traffic, and techniques to detect the position of ships and estimate their velocity have become essential. Here, we investigated the potential for automatic estimation of ship velocity using the azimuth offset between ships and wakes detected using convolutional neural network (CNN) coupled with SAR imagery. We found that azimuth offset is proportional to the Doppler shift effect of the back-scattered signal in SAR, thus, it relates to the radial velocity of a moving target. Consequently, we propose a method whereby a CNN is applied to automatically detect ship wakes from TanDEM-X data. In this method, ship velocity is calculated using the azimuthal distance (i.e., azimuth offset) between the stern of the detected ship and the vertex of the detected V-shape wake-determined as the intersection of two lines obtained through edge filtering and Radon transforms. The location and number of detected ships are then compared with an automatic identification system (AIS), and the calculated velocity of the ship is compared with the velocity obtained via along-track interferometry and AIS. Results show that our method automatically detects ships and wakes with accuracies of 91.0% and 93.2%, respectively, and estimates the velocity of ships with an accuracy of 0.13 m/s. This method is effective when wind velocities are not substantially higher than 5.5 m/s and ship velocities are not extremely low.': 1,\n"," 'Satellite remote sensing has been increasingly employed for the estimation of ground-level atmospheric PM2.5. There have been several cross-validation (CV) approaches applied for the validation of satellite-based PM2.5 estimation models. However, these validation approaches often lead to confusion, due to the unclear applicable conditions. For this, we fully analyze and assess the existing validation approaches, and provide suggestions on applicable conditions for them. Furthermore, the existing validation approaches still have limitations to disregard the uneven distribution of ground stations, and tend to overestimate the performance of the PM2.5 estimation models. To this end, a CV-based validation approach considering the uneven spatial distribution of monitoring stations (denoted as SDCV) is proposed. SDCV introduces the spatial distance between validation station and modeling station into the CV process, and evaluates the spatial performance through a strategy of excluding modeling stations within a specific distance. Meanwhile, this approach has designed reasonable evaluation indices for the model validation. Taking China as a case study, the results indicate that SDCV can yield a more complete and effective evaluation for the popular PM2.5 estimation models than the traditional validation approaches.': 1,\n"," 'In the previous years, vision transformer has demonstrated a global information extraction capability in the field of computer vision that convolutional neural network (CNN) lacks. Due to the lack of inductive bias in vision transformer, it requires a large amount of data to support its training. In the field of remote sensing, it costs a lot to obtain a significant number of high-resolution remote sensing images. Most existing change detection networks based on deep learning rely heavily on the CNN, which cannot effectively utilize the long-distance dependence between pixels for difference discrimination. Therefore, this work aims to use a high-performance vision transformer to conduct change detection research with limited data. A bibranch fusion network based on axial cross attention (ACABFNet) is proposed. The network extracts local and global information of images through the CNN branch and transformer branch, respectively, and then, fuses local and global features by the bidirectional fusion approach. In the upsampling stage, similar feature information and difference feature information of the two branches are explicitly generated by feature addition and feature subtraction. Considering that the self-attention mechanism is not efficient enough for global attention over small datasets, we propose the axial cross attention. First, global attention along the height and width dimensions of images is performed respectively, and then cross attention is used to fuse the global feature information along two dimensions. Compared with the original self-attention, the structure is more graphics processing unit friendly and efficient. Experimental results on three datasets reveal that the ACABFNet outperforms existing change detection algorithms.': 1,\n"," 'Hyperspectral target detection is critical in both military and civilian applications. However, it is a challenging task due to the complexity of background and the limited samples of target in hyperspectral images (HSIs). In this article, we propose a novel background learning model, called background learning based on target suppression constraint to characterize high-dimensional spectral vectors. Considering insufficient target samples, the model is trained only on the background spectral samples to accurately learn the background distribution. Then the discrepancy between the reconstructed and original HSIs are examined to spot the targets. To obtain a background training dataset, coarse detection is carried out. However, it is quite difficult to retrieve pure background data. Thus, a target suppression constraint is imposed to reduce the impact of suspected target samples on background reconstruction. Experiments on six real HSIs demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art detection methods and yields higher detection accuracy and lower false alarm rate.': 1,\n"," 'Change detection in heterogeneous remote sensing images is crucial for disaster damage assessment. Recent methods use homogenous transformation, which transforms the heterogeneous optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing images into the same feature space, to achieve change detection. Such transformations mainly operate on the low-level feature space and may corrupt the semantic content, deteriorating the performance of change detection. To solve this problem, this article presents a new homogeneous transformation model termed deep homogeneous feature fusion (DHFF) based on image style transfer (IST). Unlike the existing methods, the DHFF method segregates the semantic content and the style features in the heterogeneous images to perform homogeneous transformation. The separation of the semantic content and the style in the homogeneous transformation prevents the corruption of image semantic content, especially in the regions of change. In this way, the detection performance is improved with accurate homogeneous transformation. Furthermore, we present a new iterative IST strategy, where the cost function in each IST iteration measures and thus maximizes the feature homogeneity in additional new feature subspaces for change detection. After that, change detection is accomplished accurately on the original and the transformed images that are in the same feature space. Real remote sensing images acquired by SAR and optical satellites are utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed DHFF method achieves significant improvement for change detection in heterogeneous optical and SAR remote sensing images in terms of both accuracy rate and Kappa index.': 1,\n"," 'The digital imaging and remote sensing image generation model is a physics-based image and data simulation model that is primarily used to generate synthetic imagery across the visible to thermal infrared regions using engineering-driven descriptions of remote sensing systems. The model recently went through a major redesign and reimplementation effort to address changes in user requirements and numerical computation trends that have emerged in the 15 years since the last major development effort. The new model architecture adopts some of the latest light transport algorithms matured by the computer graphics community and features a framework that is easily parallelized at the microscale (multithreading) and macroscale (cluster-based computing). A detailed description of the framework is provided, including a novel method for efficiently storing, evaluating, integrating, and sampling spherical and hemispherical datasets appropriate for the representation of modeled or measured bidirectional scattering, reflectance, and transmission distribution functions. The capabilities of the model are then briefly demonstrated and cross-verified with scenarios of interest to the remote sensing community.': 1,\n"," 'With the hyperspectral imaging technology, hyperspectral data provides abundant spectral information and plays a more important role in the geological survey, vegetation analysis, and military reconnaissance. Different from normal change detection, hyperspectral anomaly change detection (HACD) helps to find those small but important anomaly changes between multitemporal hyperspectral images (HSI). In previous works, most classical methods use linear regression to establish the mapping relationship between two HSIs and then detect the anomalies from the residual image. However, the real spectral differences between multi-temporal HSIs are likely to be quite complex and of nonlinearity, leading to the limited performance of these linear predictors. In this article, we propose an original HACD algorithm based on autoencoder (ACDA) to give a nonlinear solution. The proposed ACDA can construct an effective predictor model when facing complex imaging conditions. In the ACDA model, two siamese autoencoder networks are deployed to construct two predictors from two directions. The predictor is used to model the spectral variation of the background to obtain the predicted image under another imaging condition. Then the mean square error between the predictive image and corresponding expected image is computed to obtain the loss map, where the spectral differences of the unchanged pixels are highly suppressed and anomaly changes are highlighted. Ultimately, we take the minimum of the two loss maps of two directions as the final anomaly change intensity map. The experiments results on public “Viareggio 2013” datasets demonstrate the efficiency and superiority over traditional methods.': 1,\n"," 'Building models are a valuable information source for urban studies and in particular for analyses of urban mass concentrations (UMCS). Most commonly, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is used for their generation. The trade-off for the high geometric detail of these data is the low spatial coverage, comparably high costs and low actualization rates. Spaceborne stereo data from Cartosat-1 are able to cover large areas on the one hand, but hold a lower geometric resolution on the other hand. In this paper, we investigate to which extent the geometric shortcomings of Cartosat-1 can be overcome integrating building footprints from topographic maps for the derivation of large-area building models. Therefore, we describe the methodology to derive digital surface models (DSMs) from Cartosat-1 data and the derivation of building footprints from topographic maps at 1:25 000 (DTK25). Both data are fused to generate building block models for four metropolitan regions in Germany with an area of ~ 16 000 km 2 . Building block models are further aggregated to 1 × 1 km grid cells and volume densities are computed. Volume densities are classified to various levels of UMCs. Performance evaluation of the building block models reveals that the building footprints are larger in the DTK-25, and building heights are lower with a mean absolute error of 3.21 m. Both factors influence the building volume, which is linearly lower than the reference. However, this error does not affect the classification of UMC, which can be classified with accuracies between 77% and 97%.': 1,\n"," 'Traditional target detection algorithms have difficulty to adapt complex environmental changes and have limited applicable scenarios.

In addition, we improve the YOLOv4 network and present a new approach. First, we propose a classification setting of the nonmaximum suppression threshold to increase the accuracy without affecting the speed. Second, we study the anchor frame allocation problem in YOLOv4 and propose two allocation schemes. The proposed anchor frame scheme also improves the detection performance, and experimental results on the DOTA dataset validate their effectiveness.': 1,\n"," 'Cloud detection of satellite imagery is very important for quantitative remote sensing research and remote sensing applications. However, many satellite sensors do not have enough bands for a quick, accurate, and simple detection of clouds. Particularly, the newly launched moderate to high spatial resolution satellite sensors of China, such as the charge-coupled device on-board the Chinese Huan Jing 1 (HJ-1/CCD) and the wide field of view (WFV) sensor on-board the Gao Fen 1 (GF-1), only have four available bands including blue, green, red, and near infrared bands, which are far from the requirements of most could detection methods. In order to solve this problem, an improved and automated cloud detection method for Chinese satellite sensors called object-oriented cloud and cloud-shadow matching method (OCM) is presented in this paper. It first modified the automatic cloud cover assessment (ACCA) method, which was developed for Landsat-7 data, to get an initial cloud map. The modified ACCA method is mainly based on threshold and different threshold settings produce different cloud maps. Subsequently, a strict threshold is used to produce a cloud map with high confidence and large amount of cloud omission and a loose threshold is used to produce a cloud map with low confidence and large amount of commission. Second, a corresponding cloud-shadow map is also produced using the threshold of nearinfrared band. Third, the cloud maps and cloud-shadow map are transferred to cloud objects and cloud-shadow objects. Cloud and cloud-shadow are usually in pairs; consequently, the final cloud and cloud-shadow maps are made based on the relationship between cloud and cloud-shadow objects. The OCM method was tested using almost 200 HJ-1/CCD and GF-1/WFV images across China and the overall accuracy of cloud detection is close to 90%.': 1,\n"," 'Operational disposition of electronic countermeasures (ECM) is a hot topic in modern warfare research. Through fully analyzing the characteristics and shortcomings of the traditional operational disposition scheme, a super-efficient data envelopment analysis support vector machine (SE-DEA-SVM) method for evaluating the operational configuration scheme of ECM is proposed. Firstly, considering the subjective and objective factors affecting the operational disposition of ECM, the index system of operational disposition scheme is established, and we explain the solution method of terminal indexs. Secondly, the evaluation and algorithm process of SE-DEA-SVM evaluation method are introduced. In this method, the super-efficient data envelopment analysis (SE-DEA) model is used to calculate the weight of index system, and the support vector machine (SVM) method combined with the training samples of evaluation index is used to obtain the input-output model of evaluation value of combat configuration. Finally, by an example (obtaining five schemes), we verify the SE-DEA-SVM evaluation method and analyze the results. The efficiency analysis, comparison analysis, and error analysis of this method are carried out. The results show that this method is more suitable for military evaluation with small samples, and it has high efficiency, applicability, and popularization value.': 1,\n"," 'The precision of sea surface altimetry using bistatically reflected signals of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is typically one to two orders of magnitude worse than dedicated radar altimeters. However, when the scattering is coherent, the electromagnetic phase of the carrier signal can be tracked, providing precise ranging measurements. Under grazing angle (GA) geometries, the conditions for coherent scattering are maximized, enabling carrier phase-delay altimetric techniques over sea waters. This work presents the first implementation of GA carrier phase sea surface altimetry using data acquired from a spaceborne platform (NASA Cyclone GNSS mission) and transmitted from both GPS and Galileo constellations. The altimetric results show that the measurement system precision is 3/4.1 cm (median/mean) at 20 Hz sampling, cm level at 1 Hz, comparable to dedicated radar altimeters. The combined precision, including systematic errors, is 16/20 cm (median/mean) precision at 50 ms integration (a few cm level at 1 Hz). The wind and wave requirements to enable coherent scattering at GA geometries appear to be below 6 m/s wind and 1.5 m significant wave height, although only 33% of tracks under these conditions present sufficient coherence. Given that this technique could be implemented by firmware updates of existing GNSS radio occultation missions, and given the large number of such missions, the study indicates that the resulting precision and spatio-temporal resolution would contribute to resolving some submesoscale ocean signals.': 1,\n"," 'Vehicle speed is a key variable for the calibration, validation, and improvement of traffic emission and air quality models. Lidar technologies have significant potential in vehicle tracking by scanning the surroundings in 3-D frequently, hence can be used as traffic flow monitoring sensors for accurate vehicle counting and speed estimation. However, the characteristics of lidar-based vehicle tracking and speed estimation, such as attainable accuracy, remain as open questions. This research therefore proposes a tracking framework from roadside lidar to detect and track vehicles with the aim of accurate vehicle speed estimation. Within this framework, on-road vehicles are first detected from the observed point clouds, after which a centroid-based tracking flow is implemented to obtain initial vehicle transformations. A tracker, utilizing the unscented Kalman Filter and joint probabilistic data association filter, is adopted in the tracking flow. Finally, vehicle tracking is refined through an image matching process to improve the accuracy of estimated vehicle speeds. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been evaluated using lidar data obtained from two different panoramic 3-D lidar sensors, a RoboSense RS-LiDAR-32 and a Velodyne VLP-16, at a traffic light and a road intersection, respectively, in order to account for real-world scenarios. Validation against reference data obtained by a test vehicle equipped with accurate positioning systems shows that more than 94% of vehicles could be detected and tracked, with a mean speed accuracy of 0.22 m/s.': 1,\n"," \"Learning powerful discriminative features is the key for remote sensing scene classification. Most existing approaches based on convolutional neural network (CNN) have achieved great results. However, they mainly focus on global-based visual features while ignoring object-based location features, which is important for large-scale scene classification. There are a large number of scene-related ground objects in remote sensing images, as well as Graph convolutional network (GCN) has the potential to capture the dependencies among objects. This article introduces a novel two-stream architecture that combines global-based visual features and object-based location features, so as to improve the feature representation capability. First, we extract appearance visual features from whole scene image based on CNN. Second, we detect ground objects and construct a graph to learn the spatial location features based on GCN. As a result, the network can jointly capture appearance visual information and spatial location information. To the best of authors' knowledge, we are the first to investigate the dependencies among objects in remote sensing scene classification task.

Suitable electromagnetic models for both the sea clutter and the signal backscattered from the ship are considered in the new technique in order to improve the detector performance. The GLRT is compared to the traditional constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm through Monte-Carlo simulations in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and computational load at different bands (S-, C-, and X-). Performances are also compared through simulations with different orbital and scene parameters at fixed values of band and polarization. The GLRT is then applied to real datasets acquired from different sensors (TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, and Airbus airborne demonstrator) operating at different bands (S-, C-, and X-). An analysis of the target-to-clutter ratio (TCR) is then performed and detection outcomes are compared with an automatic identification system data when available. Simulations show that the GLRT presents better ROCs than those obtained through the CFAR algorithm. On the other side, results on real SAR images demonstrate that the proposed approach greatly improves the TCR (between 22 and 32 dB on average), but its computational time is 1.5 times slower when compared to the CFAR algorithm.': 1,\n"," 'This article investigates and demonstrates the suitability of the Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence for land cover and vegetation mapping. In addition, this study analyzes the performance of this feature along with polarization and intensity products according to different classification strategies and algorithms. Seven different classification workflows were evaluated, covering pixel- and object-based analyses, unsupervised and supervised classification, different machine-learning classifiers, and the various effects of distinct input features in the SAR domain-interferometric coherence, backscattered intensities, and polarization. All classifications followed the Corine land cover nomenclature. Three different study areas in Europe were selected during 2015 and 2016 campaigns to maximize diversity of land cover. Overall accuracies (OA), ranging from 70% to 90%, were achieved depending on the study area and methodology, considering between 9 and 15 classes. The best results were achieved in the rather flat area of Doñana wetlands National Park in Spain (OA 90%), but even the challenging alpine terrain around the city of Merano in northern Italy (OA 77%) obtained promising results. The overall potential of Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence for land cover mapping was evaluated as very good. In all cases, coherence-based results provided higher accuracies than intensity-based strategies, considering 12 days of temporal sampling of the Sentinel-1 A stack. Both coherence and intensity prove to be complementary observables, increasing the overall accuracies in a combined strategy. The accuracy is expected to increase when Sentinel-1 A/B stacks, i.e., six-day sampling, are considered.': 1,\n"," 'Comparative evaluation is a requirement for reproducible science and objective assessment of new algorithms.

Till now, visual interpretation and field survey are still the most widely adopted techniques for landslide mapping, which are often criticized labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, deep-learning-based approach for landslide detection and mapping has drawn great attention for its significant advantages over the traditional techniques. However, lack of sufficient training samples has constrained the application of deep-learning-based approach in landslide detection from satellite images for a long time. The present study aimed to examine the feasibility of a new deep-learning-based approach to intelligently detect and map earthquake-triggered landslides from single-temporal RapidEye satellite images. Specifically, the proposed approach consists of three steps. First of all, a standard data preprocessing workflow to automatically generate training samples was designed and some data augmentation strategies were implemented to alleviate the lack of training samples. Then, a cascaded end-to-end deep learning network, namely LandsNet, was constructed to learn various features of landslides.

Deep learning approaches have been commonly employed for the SITS classification and have provided state-of-the-art performance. However, deep learning methods suffer from overfitting when labeled data are scarce. To address this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised pretraining scheme to initialize a transformer-based network by utilizing large-scale unlabeled data. In detail, the model is asked to predict randomly contaminated observations given an entire time series of a pixel. The main idea of our proposal is to leverage the inherent temporal structure of satellite time series to learn general-purpose spectral-temporal representations related to land cover semantics. Once pretraining is completed, the pretrained network can be further adapted to various SITS classification tasks by fine-tuning all the model parameters on small-scale task-related labeled data. In this way, the general knowledge and representations about SITS can be transferred to a label-scarce task, thereby improving the generalization performance of the model as well as reducing the risk of overfitting. Comprehensive experiments have been carried out on three benchmark datasets over large study areas. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pretraining scheme, leading to substantial improvements in classification accuracy using transformer, 1-D convolutional neural network, and bidirectional long short-term memory network.

A by-product is so-called the Water Indication Mask (WAM). The purpose of this supplementary information layer is to support the DEM editing process. Water surfaces usually show lower coherence in an interferometric data set due to temporal de-correlation and low backscattering. Consequently the corresponding elevation values derived from the interferogram are random and produce a virtual relief.

First, improved choices are obtained for the anchor boxes by using linear scaling based on the k-means++ algorithm. This addresses the difficulty in reflecting the advantages of YOLOv3\\'s multiscale detection, as the anchor boxes of a single detection target type between different detection scales have small differences. Second, we add uncertainty estimators for the positioning of the bounding boxes by introducing a Gaussian parameter for ship detection into the YOLOv3 framework. Finally, four anchor boxes are allocated to each detection scale in the Gaussian-YOLO layer instead of three as in the default YOLOv3 settings, as there are wide disparities in an object\\'s size and direction in remote sensing images with different resolutions.

This method is based on the observation that the perceived quality of despeckled SAR images is not always appropriately described by classical statistical and deterministic parameters that are proposed in the literature. Various evaluations are performed here. A preliminary visual qualitative evaluation is taken as a reference for the subsequent quantitative assessment. Then, a revised statistical analysis that can solve some of the drawbacks of previous methods is proposed; however, the statistical approach still has certain drawbacks. To address this problem, a new frequency analysis approach is first proposed, together with a definition of the appropriate indexes. In this way, it is possible to select the best filter in terms of noise reduction, edge and texture preservation, while limiting the effect of introduced distortions. While statistical analysis is widely used in the literature, frequency analysis has never been presented for this aim, especially for non-linear filters. We prove that frequency analysis can robustly identify the best filter, taking perceptual considerations into account, even when statistical analysis fails. Despeckling methods based on anisotropic diffusion algorithms are used for a comparison, but the proposed analysis can be applied to any filtering method. Experiments are presented with SAR images from the Italian Cosmo/Skymed constellation. Both Stripmap and Spotlight acquisitions have been evaluated, and to prove the validity of the proposed method with respect to different spatial resolutions and different classes of interest, various classes are considered.': 1,\n"," 'The potential use of the interferometric coherence measured with Sentinel-1 satellites as input feature for crop classification is explored in this study. A one-year time-series of Sentinel-1 images acquired over an agricultural area in Spain, in which 17 crop species are present, is exploited for this purpose. Different options regarding temporal baselines, polarization, and combination with radiometric data (backscattering coefficient) are analyzed. Results show that both radiometric and interferometric features provide notable classification accuracy when used individually (overall accuracy lies between 70% and 80%). It is found that the shortest temporal baseline coherences (6 days) and the use of all available intensity images perform best, hence proving the advantage of the 6-day revisit time provided by the Sentinel-1 constellation with respect to longer revisit times. It is also shown that dual-pol data always provide better classification results than single-pol ones. More importantly, when both coherence and backscattering coefficient are jointly used, a significant increase in accuracy is obtained (greater than 7% in overall accuracies). Individual accuracies of all crop types are increased, and an overall accuracy above 86% is reached. This proves that both features provide complementary information, and that the combination of interferometric and radiometric radar data constitutes a solid information source for this application.': 1,\n"," 'Oceanic LiDAR (hereafter referred to as O-LiDAR) is an important remote sensing device for measuring the near-coastal water depth and for studying the optical properties of water bodies. With the commercialization of LiDAR, the theoretical research on the underwater transmission characteristics of LiDAR has been intensified worldwide. Primary research interests include the simulation and modeling of LiDAR underwater echo signals and the inversion of optical parameters using LiDAR water echo signals. This article provides an overview of the principle of LiDAR echo signal formation, and comprehensively summarizes the LiDAR echo signal simulation modeling methods and the corresponding factors that affect modeling accuracy by focusing on the characteristics of different methods. We found that the current simulation methods of LiDAR underwater transmission echo signals primarily include an analytical method based on the radiation transfer equation and a statistical method based on the Monte Carlo (MC) model. The radiation transport equation needs to be appropriately simplified using the analytical method, usually using the quasi-single-small-angle approximation principle. The analytical method has high calculation efficiency but its accuracy is dependent to the quasi-single small-angle approximation. The statistical method can analyze the influence of various factors on echo signals by controlling the variables, but it has poor calculation efficiency. Finally, the semianalytical MC model was used to quantitatively analyze the three main factors (LiDAR system parameters, water body optical parameters, and environmental parameters) affecting underwater LiDAR transmission characteristics, and summarizes the mechanism and results of different factors.': 1,\n"," 'The low spatial resolution of hyperspectral images leads to the coexistence of multiple ground objects in a single pixel (called mixed pixels). A large number of mixed pixels in a hyperspectral image hinders the subsequent analysis and application of the image. In order to solve this problem, a novel sparse unmixing method, which considers highly similar patches in nonlocal regions of a hyperspectral image, is proposed in this article. This method exploits spectral correlation by using collaborative sparsity regularization and spatial information by employing total variation and weighted nonlocal low-rank tensor regularization. To effectively utilize the tensor decomposition, nonlocal similar patches are first grouped together. Then, these nonlocal patches are stacked to form a patch group tensor. Finally, weighted low-rank tensor regularization is enforced to constrain the patch group to obtain an estimated low-rank abundance image. Experiments on simulated and real hyperspectral datasets validated the superiority of the proposed method in better maintaining fine details and obtaining better unmixing results.': 1,\n"," 'The deep convolutional neural network (DeCNN) is considered one of promising techniques for classifying the high-spatial-resolution remote sensing (HSRRS) scenes, due to its powerful feature extraction capabilities. It is well-known that huge high-quality labeled datasets are required for achieving the better classification performances and preventing overfitting, during the training DeCNN model process. However, the lack of high-quality datasets limits the applications of DeCNN. In order to solve this problem, in this article, we propose a HSRRS image scene classification method using transfer learning and the DeCNN (TL-DeCNN) model in a few shot HSRRS scene samples. Specifically, three typical DeCNNs of VGG19, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, trained on the ImageNet2015, the weights of their convolutional layer for that of the TL-DeCNN are transferred, respectively. Then, TL-DeCNN just needs to fine-tune its classification module on the few shot HSRRS scene samples in a few epochs. Experimental results indicate that our proposed TL-DeCNN method provides absolute dominance results without overfitting, when compared with the VGG19, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, directly trained on the few shot samples.': 1,\n"," 'To the best of our knowledge, the most recent light detection and ranging (lidar)-based surveys have been focused only on specific applications such as reconstruction and segmentation, as well as data processing techniques based on a specific platform, e.g., mobile laser. However, in this article, lidar point clouds are understood from a new and universal perspective, i.e., geometric primitives embedded in versatile objects in the physical world. In lidar point clouds, the basic unit is the point coordinate. Geometric primitives that consist of a group of discrete points may be viewed as one kind of abstraction and representation of lidar data at the entity level. We categorize geometric primitives into two classes: shape primitives, e.g., lines, surfaces, and volumetric shapes, and structure primitives, represented by skeletons and edges. In recent years, many efforts from different communities, such as photogrammetry, computer vision, and computer graphics, have been made to finalize geometric primitive detection, regularization, and in-depth applications. Interpretations of geometric primitives from multiple disciplines try to convey the significance of geometric primitives, the latest processing techniques regarding geometric primitives, and their potential possibilities in the context of lidar point clouds. To this end, primitive-based applications are reviewed with an emphasis on object extraction and reconstruction to clearly show the significances of this article. Next, we survey and compare methods for geometric primitive extraction and then review primitive regularization methods that add real-world constrains to initial primitives. Finally, we summarize the challenges, expected applications, and describe possible future for primitive extraction methods that can achieve globally optimal results efficiently, even with disorganized, uneven, noisy, incomplete, and large-scale lidar point clouds.': 1,\n"," 'Temporal decorrelation is the most critical issue for the successful inversion of polarimetric SAR interferometry (Pol-InSAR) data acquired in an interferometric repeat-pass mode, typical for satellite or lower frequency airborne SAR systems. This paper provides a quantitative estimation of temporal decorrelation effects at L-band for a wide range of temporal baselines based on a unique set of multibaseline Pol-InSAR data. A new methodology that allows to quantify individual temporal decorrelation components has been developed and applied. Temporal decorrelation coefficients are estimated for temporal baselines ranging from 10 min to 54 days and converted to height inversion errors caused by them. The temporal decorrelations of γ TV (volume temporal decorrelation) and γ TG (ground temporal decorrelation) depend not only on the wind-induced movement but also strongly on the rain-induced dielectric changes in volume and on the ground at temporal baseline on the order of day or longer. At temporal baselines on the order of minutes, the wind speed is a critical parameter and the speed of 2 m/s already hampers the application of Pol-InSAR forest parameter inversion. The approach is supported and validated by using L-band E-SAR repeat-pass data acquired in the frame of three dedicated campaigns, BioSAR 2007, TempoSAR 2008, and TempoSAR 2009.': 1,\n"," 'Local manifold learning has been successfully applied to hyperspectral dimensionality reduction in order to embed nonlinear and nonconvex manifolds in the data. Local manifold learning is mainly characterized by affinity matrix construction, which is composed of two steps: neighbor selection and computation of affinity weights. There is a challenge in each step: First, the neighbor selection is sensitive to complex spectral variability due to nonuniform data distribution, illumination variations, and sensor noise; second, the computation of affinity weights is challenging due to highly correlated spectral signatures in the neighborhood. To address the two issues, in this paper, a novel manifold learning methodology based on locally linear embedding is proposed through learning a robust local manifold representation. More specifically, a hierarchical neighbor selection is designed to progressively eliminate the effects of complex spectral variability using joint normalization and to robustly compute affinity (or reconstruction) weights reducing multicollinearity via the refined neighbor selection. Additionally, an idea that combines spatial-spectral information is introduced into the proposed manifold learning methodology to further improve the robustness of affinity calculations. Classification is explored as a potential application for validating the proposed algorithm. The classification accuracy in the use of different dimensionality reduction methods is evaluated and compared, while two kinds of strategies are applied in selecting the training and test samples: random sampling and region-based sampling. Experimental results show the classification accuracy obtained by the proposed method is superior to those state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods.': 1,\n"," 'In this paper, we discuss the scientific outcomes of the 2015 data fusion contest organized by the Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee (IADF TC) of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (IEEE GRSS).

Accurate and efficient detection of urban water with remote sensing data is of great significance for urban management and planning. In this article, we proposed a new method by combining Google Earth Engine (GEE) with a multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract urban water from Landsat images, which can be summarized as “offline training and online prediction” (OTOP). That is, the training of MSCNN is completed offline, and the process of urban water extraction is implemented on GEE with the trained parameters of MSCNN. The OTOP can give full play to the respective advantages of GEE and the convolutional neural network (CNN), and can make the use of deep learning method in GEE more flexible. The proposed method can process the available satellite images with high performance, without data download and storage, and the overall performance of urban water extraction in the test areas is also higher than that of the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and random forest classifier. The results of the extended validation in the other major cities of China also showed that OTOP is robust and can be used to extract different types of urban water, which benefits from the structural design and training of MSCNN. Therefore, OTOP is especially suitable for the study of large-scale and long-term urban water change detection in the background of urbanization.': 1,\n"," 'Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in remote sensing image understanding. Recently, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have considerably improved the performance of the semantic segmentation of natural scenes. However, it is still challenging for very high-resolution remote sensing images. Due to the large and complex scenes as well as the influence of illumination and imaging angle, it is particularly difficult for the existing methods to accurately obtain the category of pixels at object boundaries—the so-called boundary blur. We propose a framework called Boundary-Aware Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation Network (BAS 4 Net), which obtains more accurate segmentation results without additional annotation workload, especially at the object boundaries. The Channel-weighted Multi-scale Feature (CMF) module balances semantic and spatial information, and the Boundary Attention Module (BAM) weights the features with rich semantic boundary information to alleviate the boundary blur. Additionally, to decrease the amount of difficult and tedious manual labeling of remote sensing images, a discriminator network infers pseudolabels from unlabeled images to assist semisupervised learning, and further improves the performance of the segmentation network. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, extensive experiments have been performed on both the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, and the novel remote sensing dataset AIR-SEG with more categories, and complex boundaries. The results demonstrate a significant improvement of accuracy especially on boundaries and for small objects.': 1,\n"," 'Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are among the most serious natural hazards in high mountain regions in the last several decades. The recent global warming has caused dramatic glacial lake changes and increased potential GLOF risk, particularly in Tibet Plateau (TP). Thus there is a pressing need to understand area and spatial distribution of glacial lakes at a large scale. Current efforts about glacial lake mapping in TP region is limited by spurious detections in the heterogeneous backgrounds. The nonlocal active contour algorithm, which takes full consideration of the regional heterogeneity in image, has been effectively applied in the field of medical image segmentation, but has not been tested at large scale of glaciated area yet. Moreover, the improved radiometric resolution and geographic coverage from Landsat 8 provides an opportunity to map glacial lakes. This study evaluated the potential of Landsat 8 images on annual glacial lake mapping in TP region which was characterized by various complex water conditions. The Google Earth Engine based cloud computing effectively facilitated the processing of a complete time series of Landsat 8 imagery from 2015 (156 path/rows and approximately 3580 scenes). Characteristics of glacial lake distribution were analyzed from aspects of size classes and elevation. Our results demonstrate that these strategies and methods automatically produce highly reliable glacial lake extents across the entire TP region, and are potentially applicable to other large-scale glacial lake mapping projects.': 1,\n"," 'Due to advances in remote sensing satellite imaging and image processing technologies and their wide applications, intelligent remote sensing satellites are facing an opportunity for rapid development.

We have recently proposed a method, named persistent scatterer pair (PSP), aimed at overcoming some limitations of standard techniques. The PSP method is characterized by the fact of exploiting only the relative properties of neighboring pairs of points for both detection and analysis of persistent scatterers (PSs), intended in the general sense of scatterers that exhibit interferometric coherence for the time period and baseline span of the acquisitions, including both point-like and distributed scatterers. Thanks to the pair-of-point approach, the PSP technique is intrinsically not affected by artifacts slowly variable in space, like those depending on atmosphere or orbits. Moreover, by exploiting a very redundant set of pair-of-point connections, the PSP approach guarantees extremely dense and accurate displacement and elevation measurements, both in correspondence of structures and when the backscattering is weak or distributed as in the case of natural terrains. In all cases, the measurements keep the full resolution of the input SAR images. In this work, the qualifying characteristics of the PSP technique are described, and several application examples and validation tests based on COSMO-SkyMed data are reported, which demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.': 1,\n"," 'The 2012 Data Fusion Contest organized by the Data Fusion Technical Committee (DFTC) of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) aimed at investigating the potential use of very high spatial resolution (VHR) multi-modal/multi-temporal image fusion.

However, GCN is a transductive learning method, which is difficult to aggregate the new node. Besides, the existing GCN-based methods divide graph construction and graph classification into two stages ignoring the influence of constructed graph error on classification results. Moreover, the available GCN-based methods fail to understand the global and contextual information of the graph. In this article, we propose a novel multiscale graph sample and aggregate network with a context-aware learning method for HSI classification. The proposed network adopts a multiscale graph sample and aggregate network (graphSAGE) to learn the multiscale features from the local regions graph, which improves the diversity of network input information and effectively solves the impact of original input graph errors on classification. By employing a context-aware mechanism to characterize the importance among spatially neighboring regions, deep contextual and global information of the graph can be learned automatically by focusing on important spatial targets. Meanwhile, the graph structure is reconstructed automatically based on the classified objects as network training, which is able to effectively reduce the influence of the initial graph error on the classification result. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real HSI datasets, which are demonstrated to outperform the compared state-of-the-art methods.': 1,\n"," 'The applied research in remote sensing images has been pushed by convolutional neural network (CNN). Because of the fixed size of the perceptual field, CNN is unable to model global semantic relevance. Modeling global semantic information is possible with the self-attentive Transformer-based model. However, the method of patch computation used by Transformer for self-attentive computation ignores the spatial information inside each patch. To address these issues, we offer the STransFuse model as a new semantic segmentation method for remote sensing images. It is a model that combines the benefits of Transformer with CNN to improve the segmentation quality of various remote sensing images. We employ a staged model to extract coarse-grained and fine-grained feature representations at various semantic scales, unlike earlier techniques based on Transformer model fusion. In order to take full advantage of the features acquired at different stages, we designed an adaptive fusion module. This module adaptively fuses the semantic information between features at different scales employing a self-attentive mechanism. The overall accuracy (OA) of our proposed model on the Vaihingen dataset is 1.36% higher than the baseline, and 1.27% improvement in OA over baseline on the Potsdam dataset. When compared to other advanced models, the STransFuse model performs admirably.': 1,\n"," 'The emergence of a convolutional neural network (CNN) has greatly promoted the development of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technology. However, the acquisition of HSI is difficult. The lack of training samples is the primary cause of low classification performance. The traditional CNN-based methods mainly use the 2-D CNN for feature extraction, which makes the interband correlations of HSIs underutilized. The 3-D CNN extracts the joint spectral-spatial information representation, but it depends on a more complex model. Also, too deep or too shallow network cannot extract the image features well. To tackle these issues, we propose an HSI classification method based on the 2D-3D CNN and multibranch feature fusion. We first combine 2-D CNN and 3-D CNN to extract image features. Then, by means of the multibranch neural network, three kinds of features from shallow to deep are extracted and fused in the spectral dimension. Finally, the fused features are passed into several fully connected layers and a softmax layer to obtain the classification results. In addition, our network model utilizes the state-of-the-art activation function Mish to further improve the classification performance. Our experimental results, conducted on four widely used HSI datasets, indicate that the proposed method achieves better performance than the existing alternatives.': 1,\n"," 'Numerical weather prediction (NWP) and buoy ocean surface winds show some systematic differences with satellite scatterometer and radiometer wind measurements, both in statistical results and in local geographical regions. It is possible to rescale these reference winds to remove certain aspects of these systematic differences. Space-borne ocean surface winds actually measure ocean surface roughness, which is related more directly to stress. Air mass density is relevant in the air-sea momentum transfer as captured in the stress vector. Therefore, apart from the already common “neutral wind correction” for atmospheric stratification, also a “mass density wind correction” is investigated here to obtain a better correspondence between satellite stress measurements and buoy or NWP winds. The bicorrected winds are called stress-equivalent winds. Stress-equivalent winds do not strongly depend on the drag formulation used and provide a rather direct standard for comparison and assimilation in user applications. This paper presents details on how this correction is performed and first results that show the benefits of this correction mainly in the extratropical regions.': 1,\n"," 'In this article, a remote sensing image change detection method based on depthwise separable convolution with U-Net is proposed, which omits the tedious steps of generating and analyzing the difference map in the traditional remote sensing image change detection method. First, two images having c-channel each can be specifically stacked into a 2c-channel image, and the change detection can be converted to an image segmentation problem, an improved full convolution network (FCN) called U-Net is exploited to directly separate the changing regions. Because the capability of the deep convolution network is proportional to the depth of the network and a deeper convolution network means the increase of the training parameters, we then replace the original convolution in FCN by the depthwise separable convolution, making the entire network lighter, while the model performs slightly better than the traditional convolution operation. Besides that, another innovation in our proposed method is to use a preference control loss function to meet the different needs of precision and recall rate. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.': 1,\n"," 'The main objective of this research was to establish a semiautomated object-based image analysis (OBIA) methodology for locating landslides.

We utilized particular combinations of these information layers to generate objects by applying multiresolution segmentation in a sequence of feature selection and object classification steps. The results were validated by using a landslide inventory database including 109 landslide events. In this study, a combination of these parameters led to a high accuracy of landslide delineation yielding an overall accuracy of 93.07%. Our results confirm the potential of OBIA for accurate delineation of landslides from satellite imagery and, in particular, the ability of OBIA to incorporate heterogeneous parameters such as DEM derivatives and surface texture measures directly in a classification process.

This article presents a novel aspect for dealing with the multireceiver SAS imagery, which still depends on the idea of monostatic conversion. The approach in this article is based on Loffeld's bistatic formula that consists of two important terms, i.e., quasi monostatic and bistatic deformation terms. Our basic idea is to preprocess the bistatic deformation term and then incorporate the quasi monostatic term into an analogous monostatic spectrum. With this new spectrum, traditional imaging algorithms designed for monostatic synthetic aperture sonar can be easily exploited. In this article, we show that Loffeld's bistatic formula can be reduced to the same formula as spectrum based on phase centre approximation when certain conditions are met. Based on our error analysis, the maximum error magnitude of PCA method is about 1 rad, which would noticeably affect the SAS imagery. Fortunately, the error magnitude of presented method can be always kept within {{\\\\rm{\\\\pi }} \\\\mathord{/ {\\\\vphantom {{\\\\rm{\\\\pi }} 4}} \\\\kern-\\\\nulldelimiterspace} 4} . It means that Loffeld's bistatic formula provides a more accurate approximation of the spectrum compared to that based on phase centre approximation.

Many methods have been recently developed based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the pansharpening task, but most of them still have some drawbacks: 1) The information cannot efficiently flow in their simple stacked convolutional architectures, thereby hindering the representation ability of the networks. 2) They are commonly trained using supervised learning, which does not only require an extra effort to produce the simulated training data, but can also lead to scale-related problems in the fusion results. In this article, we propose a novel unsupervised CNN-based pansharpening method to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we design an iterative network architecture, in which a PAN-guided strategy and a set of skip connections are adopted to continuously extract and fuse the features from the input, thus enhancing the information reuse and transmission. Besides, we propose a new loss function for unsupervised training in which the relationships between the input MS and PAN images and the fused MS image are used to design the spatial constrains and spectral consistency, respectively. The typical quality index with no-reference is also added to this function to further adjust the spectral and spatial qualities. The designed loss function allows the network to be learned only on input images, without any hand-crafted labels (reference HR MS image). We evaluated the effectiveness of our designed network architecture and the combined loss function, and the experiments testify that our unsupervised strategy can also obtain promising results with minor spectral and spatial distortions compared with other traditional and supervised methods.': 1,\n"," \"This paper presents a comparative study among four operational detectors that work by automatically post-processing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired from the satellite platforms RADARSAT-2 and COSMO-SkyMed.

Although the results show that all the detectors perform well, there is no perfect detector, and a better detection system could be developed that combines the best elements from each of the single detectors. In addition to the comparison exercise, the study has facilitated the improvement of the detectors by highlighting weaknesses and providing means for fixing them.\": 1,\n"," 'The information from the components obtained by waveform decomposition is usually used to inverse topography, and classify tree species, etc. Many efforts on waveform decomposition algorithms have been presented, but they lack comparison analysis and evaluation. Thereby, this article compares and analyzes the performance of five waveform decomposition algorithms, which are Gaussian, Adaptive Gaussian, Weibull, Richardson–Lucy (RL), and Gold, under different topographic conditions such as forests, glaciers, lakes, and residential areas. The experimental results reveal that: first, the Gaussian algorithm causes the biggest fitting error at 9.96 mV in the forested area. It is easy to identify multiple dense peaks as single peaks. Second, there are many misjudged, superimposed, and overlapped waveform components separated by the Weibull algorithm. The Adaptive Gaussian is more capable of fitting complex waveforms but has 122 more outliers than the Weibull algorithm does. Third, the Gold and RL algorithms decompose the largest number of waveform components (272.2k and 265.9k) in the forested area; both RL and Gold algorithms can effectively improve the separability of peaks. Fourth, the RL algorithm is only more effective for the area with sparse vegetation than the Gold algorithm does, i.e., the Gold algorithm is capable of processing data with dense vegetation areas at a lowest false component detection rate of 1.3%, 0.9%, 1.1%, and 0.1% in four areas. Finally, the Gaussian and Gold algorithms have much faster decomposition speed at 1000/s and 2000/s than the other three algorithms do. These results are useful for selecting different algorithms under different environments.': 1,\n"," 'Many aerosol retrieval algorithms based on the remote sensing technology have been developed and applied to produce aerosol optical depth (AOD) products for different satellite sensors. The dark target (DT) and deep blue (DB) algorithms are two main MODIS aerosol retrieval algorithms that are suitable for dark or bright areas. The estimation of land surface reflectance (LSR) is necessary to improve the accuracy of AOD retrievals. Therefore, in this paper, a new procedure to improve LSR estimation using MODIS surface reflectance products is developed. A new high-resolution <;1000 m> aerosol retrieval algorithm with a priori LSR database support (HARLS) is proposed. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the spatial adaptability of different MODIS AOD products produced by the above three algorithms. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) region, which features complex surface structures and serious air pollution, was chosen as the study area, and the different AOD products are validated using aerosol robotic network (AERONET) AOD ground measurements from four stations located in dark and bright areas. Compared with the DT retrievals (R ≈ 0.88 - 0.95), the C6 DB AOD retrievals yield a stronger correlation (R ≈ 0.94 - 0.97) with AERONET AOD and lower RMSE, MRE and MAE values, resulting in approximately 20%-30% less average overestimation. The C6 DT&DBAODresultsshowaretrievalquality (R ≈ 0.93 - 0.97) similar to that of DB, with approximately 50%-70% of the collections falling within the expected error (EE). Moreover, DT&DB is much better than DT, with more than approximately 10%-20% of the collections falling within the EE. However, HARLS achieves a high correlation (R ≈ 0.93 - 0.96) with the AERONET AODs, with low RMSE (≈ 0.118 - 0.128) and MAE (≈ 0.09 - 0.12) and small offsets (intercept 0.00 - 0.04). HARLS retrievals exhibited 7%-8% less uncertainty than the C6 DB retrievals, 37%-38% less uncertainty than the C6 DT&DB retrievals, and 39%-44% less uncertainty than the C5 and C6 DT retrievals. HARLS achieves greater accuracy and reliability in AOD retrieval, and itis less biased (RMB ≈ 0.90 - 1.10) and better overall than the routine MODIS aerosol products over the Jing-Jin-Ji region.': 1,\n"," 'The automatic extraction of building outlines from high-resolution images is an important and challenging task. Convolutional neural networks have shown excellent results compared with traditional building extraction methods because of their ability to extract high-level abstract features from images. However, it is difficult to fully utilize the multiple features of current building extraction methods; consequently, the resulting building boundaries are irregular. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method for extracting buildings from high-resolution images using a multifeature convolutional neural network (MFCNN) and morphological filtering. Our method consists of two steps. First, the MFCNN, which consists of residual connected unit, dilated perception unit, and pyramid aggregation unit, is used to achieve pixel-level segmentation of the buildings. Second, morphological filtering is used to optimize the building boundaries, improve the boundary regularity, and obtain refined building boundaries. The Massachusetts and Inria datasets are selected for experimental analysis. Under the same experimental conditions, the extraction results achieved with the proposed MFCNN are compared with the results of other deep learning models that have been commonly used in recent years: FCN-8s, SegNet, and U-Net. The results on both datasets reveal that the proposed model improves the F1-score by 3.31%-5.99%, increases the overall accuracy (OA) by 1.85%-3.07%, and increases the intersection over union (IOU) by 3.47%-8.82%. These findings illustrate that the proposed method is effective at extracting buildings from complex scenes.': 1,\n"," 'In this article, we propose an automatic and efficient method to solve optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image registration using the improved phase congruency (PC) model. First, evenly distributed keypoints are extracted from the optical images via the block-Harris method. Complementary grid points are then selected in image regions with poor structural information and supplemented to the keypoint set. For each keypoint, a robust feature representation that captures the local spatial relationship is proposed based on the improved PC model. Specifically, we propose to use two different PC models, the classic PC and the SAR-PC, to construct features for optical and SAR images, respectively. The PC features of several directions are aggregated to construct the feature descriptors, and a similarity metric via the phase correlation of feature descriptors is obtained. The proposed similarity metric cannot only find accurate correspondence but also present efficient results without presetting the size of the search region. We compare the proposed method with two baselines and state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, i.e., OS-SIFT, histogram of oriented PC, and channel features of oriented gradients, in various scenarios. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines and shows comparable performance with SOTA methods in regions with abundant structural information and better performance in regions with less structural information. Moreover, we build a high-resolution optical and SAR image matching dataset, which consists of 10 692 nonoverlapping patch pairs of $256\\\\times 256$ pixels and 1-m resolution. Results of two benchmarks, Siamese deep matching network, and conditional generative adversarial networks show that this dataset is practical and challenging.': 1,\n"," 'Distance functions are at the core of important data analysis and processing tools, e.g., PCA, classification, vector median filter, and mathematical morphology. Despite its key role, a distance function is often used without careful consideration of its underlying assumptions and mathematical construction. With the objective of identifying a suitable distance function for hyperspectral images so as to maintain the accuracy of hyperspectral image processing results, we compare existing distance functions and define a suitable set of selection criteria. Bearing in mind that the selection of distance functions is highly related to the actual definition of the spectrum, we also classify the existing distance functions based on how they inherently define a spectrum. Theoretical constraints and behavior, as well as numerical tests are proposed for the evaluation of distance functions. With regards to the evaluation criteria, Euclidean distance of cumulative spectrum (ECS) was found to be the most suitable distance function.': 1,\n"," 'In this paper, we report results of a study aimed at assessing the potential for using X-band single-pass radar interferometric coherence for forest canopy height estimation.

We first employ dual-copolarized modes to assess the potential of polarimetric interferometry for forest canopy height retrieval. We show that for this forest type, single polarization modes have better properties, including much improved spatial coverage. We develop a new algorithm for single polarization data and validate the canopy height products against lidar. We then extend the canopy height product over a mosaic of multiple swaths to demonstrate the potential for very wide area forest height mapping using radar coherence.': 1,\n"," 'Restoration is important in preprocessing hyperspectral images (HSI) to improve their visual quality and the accuracy in target detection or classification. In this paper, we propose a new low-rank spectral nonlocal approach (LRSNL) to the simultaneous removal of a mixture of different types of noises, such as Gaussian noises, salt and pepper impulse noises, and fixed-pattern noises including stripes and dead pixel lines. The low-rank (LR) property is exploited to obtain precleaned patches, which can then be better clustered in our spectral nonlocal method (SNL). The SNL method takes both spectral and spatial information into consideration to remove mixed noises as well as preserve the fine structures of images. Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that LRSNL, although simple, is an effective approach to the restoration of HSI.': 1,\n"," 'Due to its remarkable feature representation capability and high performance, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have emerged as a popular choice for hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis. However, the performances of traditional CNN-based patch-wise classification methods are limited by insufficient training samples, and the evaluation strategies tend to provide overoptimistic results due to training-test information leakage. To address these concerns, we propose a novel spectral-spatial 3-D fully convolutional network (SS3FCN) to jointly explore the spectral-spatial information and the semantic information. SS3FCN takes small patches of original HSI as inputs and produces the corresponding sized outputs, which enhances the utilization rate of the scarce labeled images and boosts the classification accuracy. In addition, to avoid the potential information leakage and make a fair comparison, we introduce a new principle to generate classification benchmarks. Experimental results on four popular benchmark datasets, including Salinas Valley, Pavia University, Indian Pines, and Houston University, demonstrate that the SS3FCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can be served as a baseline for future research on HSI classification.': 1,\n"," 'In this article, a retrieval algorithm based on the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed for wind speed estimations from cyclone global navigation satellite system (CYGNSS). The delay/Doppler map average and the leading edge slope observables, derived from CYGNSS delay/Doppler maps, are used as inputs to the network, along with geographical, geometry, and hardware antenna information. The derivation of the optimal number of hidden layers and neurons is obtained using statistical metrics of agreement between the CYGNSS data and the wind matchups obtained from modelled winds output by the wavewatch 3 (WW3) model. A cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching step is applied to the network outputs, to impose that the CDF of the retrievals matches that of the matchups. The resulting wind speeds are unbiased with respect to WW3 modeled winds, and deliver a global root mean square (RMS) difference (RMSD) of 1.51 m/s, over a dynamic range of wind speeds up to 32 m/s. The obtained RMSD is the lowest among those seen in literature for wind speed retrievals from CYGNSS. A comparison is carried out between the winds retrieved from the ANN approach and those derived using the fully developed sea approach, which represent the CYGNSS baseline wind product. The comparison highlights that the ANN approach outperforms the baseline approach for both low and high wind speeds and removes most of the geographical biases between baseline winds and WW3 winds seen in monthly maps of wind speeds. The ANN approach could well be applied to the entire CYGNSS dataset to generate an enhanced wind speed product.': 1,\n"," 'With the rapid development of aerospace and various remote sensing platforms, the amount of data related to remote sensing is increasing rapidly. To meet the application requirements of remote sensing big data, an increasing number of scholars are combining deep learning with remote sensing data.

In order to fully extract the characteristics of HSIs and improve the accuracy of image classification, this article proposes a novel three-dimensional (3-D) channel and spatial attention-based multiscale spatial-spectral residual network (termed CSMS-SSRN). The CSMS-SSRN framework uses a three-layer parallel residual network structure by using different 3-D convolutional kernels to continuously learn spectral and spatial features from their respective residual blocks. Then, the extracted depth multiscale features are stacked and input into the 3-D attention module to enhance the expressiveness of the image features from the two aspects of channel and spatial domains, thereby improving the accuracy of classification. The CSMS-SSRN framework proposed in this article can achieve better classification performance on different HSI datasets.': 1,\n"," \"While deep learning-based methods have gained considerable improvements in remote sensing (RS) image change detection (CD), scale variations and pseudochanges hinder most supervised methods' performance. The CD networks derived from other fields can be fronted with false alarms and miss detections in high-resolution RS images due to the weak feature representation ability. In this article, an attention-guided end-to-end change detection network (AGCDetNet) is proposed based on the fully convolutional network and attention mechanism. AGCDetNet learns to enhance the feature representation of change information and achieve accuracy improvements using spatial attention and channel attention. A spatial attention module (SPAM) promotes the discrimination between the changed objects and the background by adding the learned spatial attention to the deep features. Channelwise attention-guided interference filtering unit (CIFU)/atrous spatial pyramid pooling (CG-ASPP) module enhances the representation of multilevel features and multiscale context, respectively. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several public datasets for performance evaluation, including LEVIR-CD, WHU, Season-Varying, WV2, and ZY3. Experiment results demonstrate that AGCDetNet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods of accuracy and robustness. Specifically, AGCDetNet achieves the best F1-score on two datasets, i.e., LEVIR-CD (0.9076) and Season-Varying (0.9654).\": 1,\n"," 'Laplacian support vector machine (LapSVM), as a benchmark method, which includes an additional regularization term with graph Laplacian, has been successfully applied to remote sensing image classification. However, using the Euclidean distance to construct weights, the graph in LapSVM may not really represent the inherent distribution of the data. In this paper, optimized LapSVMs are developed for semisupervised hyperspectral image classification, by introducing distance metric learning instead of the traditional Euclidean distance which is used in the existing LapSVM. In the procedure of constructing graph with distance metric learning, equivalence and non-equivalence pairwise constraints are imposed for better capturing similarity of samples from different classes. In this way, two new optimization problems are reformulated for building LapSVM with normalized and unnormalized graph Laplacian respectively. Experiments are conducted on two real hyperspectral datasets. Corresponding results obtained with low number of labeled training samples demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods for hyperspectral image classification.': 1,\n"," 'Accurate individual tree segmentation is an important basis for the subsequent calculation and analysis of forestry parameters. However, rasterized canopy height model based methods often suffer from 3-D information loss due to the interpolation operation. Therefore, this article proposes an individual tree segmentation method based on the marker-controlled watershed algorithm and 3-D spatial distribution analysis from airborne LiDAR point clouds. First, based on the potential tree apices derived from the local maxima filtering, the marker-controlled watershed segmentation algorithm is conducted to obtain the coarse point clusters. Then, within the principal component analysis defined local coordinate reference framework, a multidirectional 3-D spatial profile analysis is performed on each point cluster to refine the potential tree apex positions. Finally, the refined potential tree apex positions are used as a prior of K-means clustering to achieve the coarse-to-fine individual tree segmentation. Comparative experiments were conducted on the public NEWFOR dataset to evaluate the proposed method. Results indicate that the proposed method is efficient and robust for segmenting individual trees.': 1,\n"," 'Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is one of the most important criteria for surface vegetation status. This criterion corresponds to the complement of gap fraction unity at the nadir direction and accounts for the amount of horizontal vegetation distribution.

The study area was within an oasis in the Heihe Basin, Northwest China, where the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research was conducted. Reference FVC was generated through upscaling, which fitted field-measured data with spaceborne and airborne data to retrieve high-resolution FVC, and then high-resolution FVC was aggregated with a coarse scale. The fraction of green vegetation cover product (i.e., GEOV1 FVC) of SPOT/VEGETATION data taken during the GEOLAND2 project was compared with reference data. GEOV1 FVC was generally overestimated for crops in the study area compared with our estimates. Reference FVC exhibits a systematic uncertainty, and GEOV1 can overestimate FVC by up to 0.20. This finding indicates the necessity of reanalyzing and improving GEOV1 FVC over croplands.': 1,\n"," 'Satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar has proven to be a valuable tool for sea ice monitoring for more than two decades. In this study, we examine the performance of an automated sea ice classification algorithm based on polarimetric TerraSAR-X images.

In a second step, we train an artificial neural network, and then, feed the feature vectors into the trained neural network to classify each pixel into an ice type. The first part of our analysis addresses the predictive value of different subsets of features for our classification process (by means of measuring mutual information). Some polarimetric features such as polarimetric span and geometric intensity are proven to be more useful than eigenvalue decomposition based features. The classification is based on and validated by in situ data acquired during the N-ICE2015 field campaign. The results on a TerraSAR-X dataset indicate a high reliability of a neural network classifier based on polarimetric features. Performance speed and accuracy promise applicability for near real-time operational use.': 1,\n"," 'The hyperspectral image superresolution (HSI-SR) problem aims to improve the spatial quality of a low spatial resolution HSI by fusing the LR-HSI with the corresponding high spatial resolution multispectral image. The generated HSI with high spatial quality, i.e., the target high spatial resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI), generally has some fundamental latent properties, e.g., the sparsity, and the piecewise smoothness along with the three modes (i.e., width, height, and spectral mode). However, limited works consider both properties in the HSI-SR problem. In this work, a novel unidirectional total variation (TV) based approach is been proposed. On the one hand, we consider that the target HR-HSI exhibits both the sparsity and the piecewise smoothness on the three modes, and they can be depicted well by the ℓ 1 -norm and TV, respectively. On the other hand, we utilize the classical Tucker decomposition to decompose the target HR-HSI (a three-mode tensor) as a sparse core tensor multiplied by the dictionary matrices along with the three modes. Especially, we impose the ℓ 1 -norm on core tensor to characterize the sparsity and the unidirectional TV on three dictionaries to characterize the piecewise smoothness. The proximal alternating optimization scheme and the alternating direction method of multipliers are used to iteratively solve the proposed model. Experiments on three common datasets illustrate that the proposed approach has better performance than some current state-of-the-art HSI-SR methods.

The straightforward convolutional neural network-based models have limitations in exploiting the multiscale spatial and spectral features, and this is the key factor in dealing with the high-dimensional nonlinear characteristics present in HSIs. The proposed hierarchical residual network can extract multiscale spatial and spectral features at a granular level, so the receptive fields range of this network will be increased, which can enhance the feature representation ability of the model. Besides, we utilize the attention mechanism to set adaptive weights for spatial and spectral features of different scales, and this can further improve the discriminative ability of extracted features. Furthermore, the double branch structure is also exploited to extract spectral and spatial features with corresponding convolution kernels in parallel, and the extracted spatial and spectral features of multiple scales are fused for hyperspectral image classification. Four benchmark hyperspectral datasets collected by different sensors and at different acquisition time are employed for classification experiments, and comparative results reveal that the proposed method has competitive advantages in terms of classification performance when compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning models.': 1,\n"," 'The past years have witnessed great progress on remote sensing (RS) image interpretation and its wide applications.

It is crucial to measure the active layer thickness (ALT) for characterizing and monitoring the permafrost degradation of QTP. In this paper, an ALT retrieval model based on ground subsidence derived from synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR), land cover types, and groundwater information is proposed. In particular, the surface subsidence is retrieved using the time-series InSAR technique with TerraSAR-X ST mode images. Moreover, groundwater content models with different land covers are constructed based on multilayered assumptions and in situ data. By taking into account the groundwater content profile and land cover types, the ALT is retrieved from deformation with the full season cycle derived by InSAR technique. The experimental results in Beiluhe indicate that the estimated ALT is consistent with field-measured data. The estimated ALT map shows the difference between the alpine meadow and alpine desert areas, with mean ALT of approximately 1.5 m in alpine meadow area and approximately 3 m in alpine desert area. Our results demonstrate that the InSAR technique with high-resolution SAR images can be of great importance for the study of permafrost environments.': 1,\n"," 'To improve the performance of crop models for regional crop yield estimates, a particle filter (PF) was introduced to develop a data assimilation strategy using the Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)—Wheat model.

The significant improvements in the yield estimation suggest that PF-based crop model data assimilation is feasible. Winter wheat yields from the field plots were forecasted with a determination coefficient ( ${\\\\bf R}^{\\\\bf 2}$ ) of 0.87, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 251 kg/ha, and a relative error (RE) of 2.95%.

The formation was established to acquire a global high-precision digital elevation model (DEM) using SAR interferometry (InSAR). In order to achieve the required height accuracy of the TanDEM-X DEM, at least two global coverages have to be acquired. However, in difficult and mountainous terrain, up to five coverages are present. Here, acquisitions from ascending and descending orbits are needed to fill gaps and to overcome geometric limitations. Therefore, a strategy to properly combine the available height estimates is mandatory. The objective of this paper is the presentation of the operational TanDEM-X DEM mosaicking approach. In general, multiple InSAR DEM heights are combined by means of a weighted average with the height error as weight. Apart from this widely used mosaicking approach, one big challenge remains with the handling of larger height discrepancies between the input data, which are mainly caused by phase unwrapping errors, but also by temporal changes between acquisitions. In the case of inconsistencies, the TanDEM-X mosaicking approach performs a grouping into height levels. A priority concept is set up to evaluate the different groups of heights considering the number of DEMs and several InSAR quality parameters: the height error, the phase unwrapping method, and the height of ambiguity. This allows the identification of the most reliable height level for mosaicking. This fusion concept is verified on different test areas affected by phase unwrapping errors in flat and mountainous terrain as well as by height discrepancies in forests. The results show that the quality of the final TanDEM-X DEM mosaic benefits a lot from this mosaicking approach.': 1,\n"," 'The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has been validating its soil moisture (SM) products since the start of data production on March 31, 2015.

The validation approach also includes other (“sparse network”) in situ SM measurements, satellite SM products, model-based SM products, and field experiments. Over the past six years, the SMAP SM products have been analyzed with respect to these reference data, and the analysis approaches themselves have been scrutinized in an effort to best understand the products’ performance. Validation of the most recent SMAP Level 2 and 3 SM retrieval products (R17000) shows that the L -band (1.4 GHz) radiometer-based SM record continues to meet mission requirements. The products are generally consistent with SM retrievals from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity mission, although there are differences in some regions. The high-resolution (3-km) SM retrieval product, generated by combining Copernicus Sentinel-1 data with SMAP observations, performs within expectations. Currently, however, there is limited availability of 3-km CVS data to support extensive validation at this spatial scale. The most recent (version 5) SMAP Level 4 SM data assimilation product providing surface and root-zone SM with complete spatio–temporal coverage at 9-km resolution also meets performance requirements.

In this article, we propose a novel learning scheme for training a lightweight ship detector called Tiny YOLO-Lite, which simultaneously 1) reduces the model storage size; 2) decreases the floating point operations (FLOPs) calculation; and 3) guarantees the high accuracy with faster speed. This is achieved by self-designed backbone structure and network pruning, which enforces channel-level sparsity in the backbone network and yields a compact model. In addition, knowledge distillation is also applied to make up for the performance decline caused by network pruning. Hereinto, we propose to let small student model mimic cumbersome teacher's output to achieve improved generalization. Rather than applying vanilla full feature imitation, we redefine the distilled knowledge as the inter-relationship between different levels of feature maps and then transfer it from the large network to a smaller one. On account that the detectors should focus more on the salient regions containing ships while background interference is overwhelming, a novel attention mechanism is designed and then attached to the distilled feature for enhanced representation. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on SSDD, HRSID, and two large-scene SAR images to verify the effectiveness of the thinner SAR ship object detector in comparison of with other CNN-based algorithms. The detection results demonstrate that the proposed detector can achieve lighter architecture with 2.8-M model size, more efficient inference (>200 fps) with low computation cost, and more accurate prediction with knowledge transfer strategy.\": 1,\n"," 'Nonagriculturalization incidents are serious threats to local agricultural ecosystem and global food security. Remote sensing change detection (CD) can provide an effective approach for in-time detection and prevention of such incidents. However, existing CD methods are difficult to deal with the large intraclass differences of cropland changes in high-resolution images. In addition, traditional CNN based models are plagued by the loss of long-range context information, and the high computational complexity brought by deep layers. Therefore, in this article, we propose a CNN-transformer network with multiscale context aggregation (MSCANet), which combines the merits of CNN and transformer to fulfill efficient and effective cropland CD. In the MSCANet, a CNN-based feature extractor is first utilized to capture hierarchical features, then a transformer-based MSCA is designed to encode and aggregate context information. Finally, a multibranch prediction head with three CNN classifiers is applied to obtain change maps, to enhance the supervision for deep layers.

Recent studies have proven remote sensing is an efficient method for yield estimation and machine learning, especially deep learning, can infer a good prediction by integrating multisource datasets such as satellite data, climate data, soil data, and so on. However, there are some bottleneck challenges to improve accuracy. First, the popular remote sensing data used for yield prediction fall into two major groups-time-series data and constant data. Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to deep learning networks which can integrate the two kinds of data effectively; second, both temporal and spatial features play a role in affecting the yields. But most of the existing approaches employed either convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN). CNN cannot learn temporal patterns, while RNN barely can learn spatial characteristics. This work proposed a novel multilevel deep learning model coupling RNN and CNN to extract both spatial and temporal features.

As such, discriminative features can be extracted even if some samples are corrupted more or less. In addition, a novel dual channel framework based on robust CapsNet is further proposed to fuse the hyperspectral data and light detection and ranging-derived elevation data for classification. Three widely used hyperspectral datasets are employed to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed deep learning models.': 1,\n"," 'Automatic road extraction from remote sensing images plays an important role for navigation, intelligent transportation, and road network update, etc. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods have presented many achievements for road extraction from remote sensing images. CNN-based methods require a large dataset with high quality labels for model training. However, there is still few standard and large dataset, which is specially designed for road extraction from optical remote sensing images. Besides, the existing end-to-end CNN models for road extraction from remote sensing images are usually with symmetric structure, studying on asymmetric structure between encoding and decoding is rare. To address the above problems, this article first provides a publicly available dataset LRSNY for road extraction from optical remote sensing images with manually labelled labels. Second, we propose a reconstruction bias U-Net for road extraction from remote sensing images. In our model, we increase the decoding branches to obtain multiple semantic information from different upsamplings. Experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared with other six state-of-the-art segmentation models when testing on our LRSNY dataset. We also test on Massachusetts and Shaoshan datasets. The good performances on the two datasets further prove the effectiveness of our method.': 1,\n"," 'Multitemporal Earth observation capability plays an increasingly important role in crop monitoring. As the frequency of satellite acquisition of remote sensing images becomes higher, how to fully exploit the implicit phenological laws in dense multitemporal data is of increasing importance. In this article, we propose a CNN-transformer approach to perform the crop classification, in the model, we borrow the transformer architecture from the knowledge of NLP to dig into the pattern of multitemporal sequence. First, after unifying the spatial-spectral scale of each multiband data acquired from different sensors, we obtain the scale-consistent feature and position feature of multitemporal sequence. Second, with adopting multilayer encoder modules derived from the transformer, we mine deep correlation patterns of multitemporal sequence. Finally, the feed-forward layer and softmax layer serve as output layers of the model to predict crop categories. The proposed CNN-transformer approach is illustrated in a crop-rich agricultural region in central California, where 65 multitemporal profiles from multisensor Sentinel-2 A/B and Landsat-8 are obtained in 2018. Through multiband multiresolution fusion, sequence correlation extraction of multitemporal data and category feature extraction, the classification results show that the proposed method has a significant performance improvement compared with other traditional methods.': 1,\n"," 'Because of the rapid growth of multimodal data from the internet and social media, a cross-modal retrieval has become an important and valuable task in recent years.The purpose of the cross-modal retrieval is to obtain the result data in one modality (e.g., image), which is semantically similar to the query data in another modality (e.g., text).In the field of remote sensing, despite a great number of existing works on image retrieval, there has only been a small amount of research on the cross-modal image-text retrieval, due to the scarcity of datasets and the complicated characteristics of remote sensing image data. In this article, we introduce a novel cross-modal image-text retrieval network to establish the direct relationship between remote sensing images and their paired text data. Specifically, in our framework, we designed a semantic alignment module to fully explore the latent correspondence between images and text, in which we used the attention and gate mechanisms to filter and optimize data features so that more discriminative feature representations can be obtained. Experimental results on four benchmark remote sensing datasets, including UCMerced-LandUse-Captions, Sydney-Captions, RSICD, and NWPU-RESISC45-Captions, well showed that our proposed method outperformed other baselines and achieved the state-of-the-art performance in remote sensing image-text retrieval tasks.': 1,\n"," 'Land-cover datasets are crucial for research on eco-hydrological processes and earth system modeling. Many land-cover datasets have been derived from remote-sensing data. However, their spatial resolutions are usually low and their classification accuracy is not high enough, which are not well suited to the needs of land surface modeling. Consequently, a comprehensive method for monthly land-cover classification in the Heihe river basin (HRB) with high spatial resolution is developed. Moreover, the major crops in the HRB are also distinguished. The proposed method integrates multiple classifiers and multisource data. Three types of data including MODIS, HJ-1/CCD, and Landsat/TM and Google Earth images are used. Compared to single classifier, multiple classifiers including thresholding, support vector machine (SVM), object-based method, and time-series analysis are integrated to improve the accuracy of classification. All the data and classifiers are organized using a decision tree. Monthly land-cover maps of the HRB in 2013 with 30-m spatial resolution are made. A comprehensive validation shows great improvement in the accuracy. First, a visual comparison of the land-cover maps using the proposed method and standard SVM method shows the classification differences and the advantages of the proposed method. The confusion matrix is used to evaluate the classification accuracy, showing an overall classification accuracy of over 90% in the HRB, which is quite higher than previous approaches. Furthermore, a ground campaign was performed to evaluate the accuracy of crop classification and an overall accuracy of 84.09% for the crop classification was achieved.': 1,\n"," \"In this study, the capability of Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry in evaluating forest biomass from space has been investigated by using data coming from the TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) mission of Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. and from the Cyclone Satellite System (CyGNSS) mission of NASA. The analysis has been first conducted using TDS-1 data on a local scale, by selecting five test areas located in different parts of the Earth's surface. The areas were chosen as examples of various forest coverages, including equatorial and boreal forests. Then, the analysis has been extended by using CyGNSS to a global scale, including any type of forest coverage. The peak of the Delay Doppler Map calibrated to retrieve an “equivalent” reflectivity has been exploited for this investigation and its sensitivity to forest parameters has been evaluated by a direct comparison with vegetation optical depth (VOD) derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive L-band radiometer, with a pantropical aboveground biomass (AGB) map and then with a tree height (H) global map derived from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System installed on-board the ICEsat satellite. The sensitivity analysis confirmed the decreasing trend of the observed equivalent reflectivity for increasing biomass, with correlation coefficients 0.31 ≤ R ≤ 0.54 depending on the target parameter (VOD, AGB, or H) and on the considered dataset (local or global). These correlations were not sufficient to retrieve the target parameters by simple inversion of the direct relationships. The retrieval has been therefore based on Artificial Neural Networks making it possible to add other inputs (e.g., the incidence angle, the signal to noise ratio, and the lat/lon information in case of global maps) to the algorithm. Although not directly correlated to the biomass, these inputs helped in improving the retrieval accuracy. The algorithm was tested on both the selected areas and globally, showing a promising ability to retrieve the target parameter, either AGB or H, with correlation coefficients R ≃ 0.8.\": 1,\n"," 'Automatic target recognition of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has been a vital issue in recent studies. The recognition methods can be divided into two main types: traditional machine learning methods and deep-learning-based methods. For most traditional machine learning methods, target features are extracted based on electromagnetic scattering characteristics which are interpretable and stable. However, the extraction process of effective recognition features is often complex and the computational efficiency is low. Compared with the traditional methods, the deep learning methods can directly learn the high-dimensional features of the target to obtain higher target recognition accuracy. However, these algorithms have poor generalization performance and are difficult to explain. In order to comprehensively consider the advantages of the two kinds of methods, this article proposes a novel method for SAR target classification based on integration parts model and deep learning algorithm. First, part convolution and modified bidirectional convolutional-recurrent network are used to extract local feature of target through parts model which is calculated based on attribute scattering centers. Then, modified all-convolutional networks are used to extract the global feature of the target. The final classification result is achieved through decision fusion of local and global features. Experimental results on the moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition show the superiority of the proposed method, especially under complex conditions. Besides, a brief analysis of target key parts with part occlusion method is given, which is helpful to the interpretability of the deep learning network.': 1,\n"," 'Hyperspectral (HS) pansharpening aims at fusing a low-resolution HS (LRHS) image with a panchromatic image to obtain a full-resolution HS image. Most of the existing HS pansharpening approaches are usually based on traditional multispectral pansharpening techniques, which are not especially tailored for two inherent challenges of the HS pansharpening, i.e., much wider spectral range gap between the two kinds of images and having to recover details in many continuous spectral bands simultaneously. In this article, we develop new spectral-fidelity convolutional neural networks (called HSpeNets) for HS pansharpening to keep the fidelity of a pansharpened image to its true spectra as much as possible. Our methods particularly focus on the decomposability of HS details, accordingly synthesizing these details progressively, and meanwhile introduce a spectral-fidelity loss. We give theoretical justifications and provide detailed experimental results, showing the superiorities of the proposed HSpeNets with regard to other state-of-the-art pansharpening approaches.': 1,\n"," 'Semantic segmentation for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images has become one of the research focuses in the field of remote sensing at present, which could accurately analyze the ground objects and their relationships. However, conventional semantic segmentation methods based on deep learning require large-scale models that are not suitable for resource-constrained UAV remote sensing tasks. Therefore, it is important to construct a light-weight semantic segmentation method for UAV remote sensing images. With this motivation, we propose a light-weight neural network model with fewer parameters to solve the problem of semantic segmentation of UAV remote sensing images. The network adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. In the encoder, we build a light-weight convolutional neural network model with fewer channels of each layer to reduce the number of model parameters. Then, feature maps of different scales from the encoder are concatenated together after resizing to carry out the multiscale fusion. Moreover, we employ two attention modules to capture the global semantic information from the context and the correlation among channels in UAV remote sensing images. In the decoder part, the model obtains predictions of each pixel through the softmax function. We conducted experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, UAVid dataset, and UDD6 dataset to verify the effectiveness of the light-weight network. Our method obtains quality semantic segmentation results evaluated on UAV remote sensing datasets with only 9 M parameters the model owns, which is competitive among popular methods with the same level of parameters.': 1,\n"," 'Although the extreme learning machine (ELM) has been successfully applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, the development of the ELM is restricted by insufficient training data. In this article, we propose a novel extreme learning machine-based ensemble transfer learning algorithm for hyperspectral image classification named TL-ELM. TL-ELM not only retains the input weights and hidden biases of the ELM learned from the target domain, but also utilizes instances in the source domain to iteratively adjust the output weights of the ELM, which are used as the weights of the training models, and then ensembles the training models with their weights for the final classification. In experiments, we choose different regions in northern Italy, namely, Pavia University and Pavia Centre, as the source dataset and target dataset, respectively, and through a comparison with other transfer learning algorithms, we demonstrate that our proposed TL-ELM algorithm is superior on HSI classification tasks with only a few labeled data points in the target domain. Furthermore, we set Pavia University as the source dataset and Pavia Centre as the target dataset to demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively transfer useful instances between different HSIs.': 1,\n"," 'The rich spectral information provided by hyperspectral imaging has made this technology very useful in the classification of remotely sensed data. However, classification of hyperspectral data is typically affected by noise and the Hughes phenomenon due to the presence of hundreds of spectral bands and correlation among them, with usually a limited number of samples for training. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a well-known technique that has been widely used for supervised dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral data. However, the use of LDA in hyperspectral remote sensing is limited due to its poor performance on small training datasets and the limited number of features that can be selected i.e., $c - 1$ , where $c$ is the number of classes in the data. To solve these problems, this article presents a folded LDA (F-LDA) for dimensionality reduction of remotely sensed HSI data in small sample size scenarios. The proposed approach allows many more discriminant features to be selected in comparison to the conventional LDA since the selection is no longer bound by the limiting factor, leading to significantly higher accuracy in the classification of pixels under SSS restrictions. The proposed approach is evaluated on five different datasets, where the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the F-LDA to the conventional LDA in terms of not only higher classification accuracy but also reduced computational complexity, and reduced contiguous memory requirements.': 1,\n"," 'Hyperspectral images (HSI) are widely applied in numerous fields for their rich spatial and spectral information. However, in these applications, we always face the situation that the available labeled samples are limited or absent. Therefore, we propose an HSI classification method based on domain adaptation broad learning (DABL). First, according to the importance of the marginal and conditional distributions, the maximum mean discrepancy is used in mapped features to adapt these distributions between source and target domains. Meanwhile the manifold regularization is added to maintain the manifold structure of the input HSI data. Second, to further reduce the distribution difference and maintain manifold structure, the domain adaptation and manifold regularization are added to the output layer of DABL. Finally, the output weights can be easily calculated by the ridge regression theory. Experimental results on three real HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DABL.': 1,\n"," 'An accurate identification of oil spill types is the basis of determining the source of leakage, evaluating the potential damage, and deciding a plan of responses for an oil spill event. Despite sufficient studies that interpreted and analyzed hyperspectral data of oil spills, these studies that identify or classify oil spill types is rather limited. Aiming at identifying different types of oil spills, this article analyses the reflectance spectra obtained from high-resolution hyperspectral sensors using multiple machine learning methods. Four types of machine learning models are applied in this article: random forest; support vector machine (SVM); and deep neural network (DNN); and DNN with differential pooling (DP-DNN). The training and testing data are collected by field experiments under different environmental condition in order to verify the robustness of the machine learning models. The characteristics of reflectance is briefly described, and the results conform with results from previous studies. The performances of the machine learning models are evaluated and compared in terms of both accuracy of prediction and computational complexity. The results indicate that the two DNN models are able to achieve the most accurate prediction among the four machine learning models at the cost of more computation. The SVM model, or the proposed DP-DNN model may be a favorable choice when training time is limited.': 1,\n"," 'Hyperspectral unmixing (HSU) is an important technique of remote sensing, which estimates the fractional abundances and the mixing matrix of endmembers in each mixed pixel from the hyperspectral image. Over the last years, the linear spectral unmixing problem has been approached as the sparse regression by different algorithms. Nevertheless, the huge solution space for individual pixels makes it difficult to search for the optimal solution in some HSU algorithms. Besides, the mixing relationship between adjacent pixels is not fully utilized as well. To better handle the huge solution space problem and explore the adjacent relationship, this article presents an improved collaborative non-negative matrix factorization and total variation algorithm (ICoNMF-TV) for HSU. The main contributions of this article are threefold: 1) a new framework named ICoNMF-TV based on non-negative matrix factorization method and TV regularization is developed to improve the performance of HSU algorithms; 2) unmixing efficiency is apparently improved; and 3) the robustness is enhanced. Experiment results on simulation dataset and real dataset demonstrate the proposed algorithm outperforms most of the similar sparse regression algorithms.': 1,\n"," 'Background estimation is an efficient infrared (IR) small target detection method. However, to deal with unknown targets, the estimation window in existing algorithms should be adjusted to perform multiscale detection and requires a lot of calculations. Besides, the stages during and after estimation have received wide attention in existing algorithms, but the research on the stages before estimation is insufficient. Moreover, existing algorithms typically regard the maximum value of different orientations as the estimation value. However, when a dim target is adjacent to high-brightness background, it is easily submerged. This article proposes a three-layer estimation window to detect targets of different sizes with only a single-scale calculation. The enhanced closest-mean background estimation method is then proposed and carefully designed before, during, and after the estimation. Before estimation, the matched filter is adopted to improve the image signal-to-noise ratio. During estimation, the principle of closest-mean is proposed to suppress high-brightness background. After estimation, a ratio-difference operation is performed to enhance the true target and suppress the background simultaneously. A simple checking mechanism is proposed to further improve the detection performance. Experiments on some IR images demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Compared with existing algorithms, the proposed method has better target enhancement, background suppression, and computational efficiency.': 1,\n"," \"Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is an effective way to predict spatial probability of landslide occurrence. Existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods apply self-built CNN with simple structure, which failed to reach CNN's full potential on high-level feature extraction, meanwhile ignored the use of numerical predisposing factors. For the purpose of exploring feature fusion based CNN models with greater reliability in LSM, this study proposes an ensemble model based on channel-expanded pre-trained CNN and traditional machine learning model (CPCNN-ML). In CPCNN-ML, pre-trained CNN with mature structure is modified to excavate high-level features of multichannel predisposing factor layers. LSM result is generated by traditional machine learning (ML) model based on hybrid feature of high-level features and numerical predisposing factors. Lantau Island, Hong Kong is selected as study area; temporal landslide inventory is used for model training and evaluation. Experimental results show that CPCNN-ML has ability to predict landslide occurrence with high reliability, especially the CPCNN-ML based on random forest. Contrast experiments with self-built CNN and traditional ML models further embody the superiority of CPCNN-ML. It is worth noting that coastal regions are newly identified landslide-prone regions compared with previous research. This finding is of great reference value for Hong Kong authorities to formulate appropriate disaster prevention and mitigation policies.\": 1,\n"," 'Long time series of vegetation productivity products are significant for the research of global carbon cycle and climate change. In this article, the 0.05° global gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP) products from 1981 to 2018 were estimated by using the improved multisource data synergized quantitative (MuSyQ) NPP algorithm. The model was based on the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) and leaf area index (LAI) data from the global land surface satellite (GLASS) dataset, the light use efficiency (LUE) from the parameterization approach with the clearness index (CI), the ERA-Interim meteorological data, and other environmental factors. The results suggested that the accuracy of the MuSyQ GPP product was slightly higher than that of the MOD17 GPP product when compared with the FLUXNET GPP, especially for the evergreen broadleaf forest (EBF), deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF), wetland (WET), cropland (CRO), woody savanna (WSAV), and closed shrubland (CSH) land types. MuSyQ NPP product also has higher accuracy [ R 2 = 0.81, RMSE = 214.6 gC/(m 2 year)] than MOD17 NPP [ R 2 = 0.55, RMSE = 214.7 gC/(m 2 year)] when compared with the BigFoot NPP, which indicated the reliability of the improved MuSyQ-NPP algorithm in estimating global NPP. Our results showed a significant upward trend in global NPP, which was most affected by FPAR, followed by LUE, temperature, and PAR. The average NPP declined significantly in Asia and Amazon tropical rainforests and increased significantly in Africa tropical rainforest, which were affected by the local deforestation or the forest expansion, and also the climate factors.': 1,\n"," 'With the exponential growth of the Internet of things (IoT) in remote sensing image applications, network resource orchestration and data privacy are significant aspects to handle in bigdata cellular networks. The image data sharing procedure toward central cloud servers in order to perform real-time classifications has leaked client personalization and heavily burdened the communication networks. Thus, the deployment of IoT image sensors in privacy-constrained sectors requires an optimized federated learning (FL) scheme to efficiently consider both aspects of securing data privacy and maximizing the model accuracy with sufficient communication and computation resources.

However, there are two major challenges that need to be addressed: 1) lack of effective supervision for feature learning; and 2) negative effect caused by the high redundancy of the global dictionary atoms. In this article, we propose an end-to-end trainable network for HSI clustering. Specifically, to ensure the extracted features are well-suited to subsequent subspace clustering, the cluster assignments with high confidence are employed as pseudo-labels to supervise the feature learning process. Then, an adaptive self-expressive coefficient matrix initialization strategy is designed to reduce the dictionary redundancy, where the spectral similarity between each target sample and its neighbors is modeled via the k-nearest neighbor graph to guide the initialization. Experimental results on three public HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, the accuracy and efficiency of SM estimation from CYGNSS still need to improve. In this article, the global SM is estimated using machine learning (ML) regression aided by a preclassification strategy. The total observations are classified by land types and corresponding subsets are built for constructing ML regression submodels. Ten-fold cross-validation technique is adopted. The overall performance of SM estimation with/without preclassification is compared, and the results show that the SM estimations using different ML algorithms all have substantial improvement with the preclassification strategy. Then, the optimal XGBoost predicted model with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.052 cm 3 /cm 3 is adopted. In addition, the satisfactory daily and seasonal SM prediction outcomes with an overall correlation coefficient value of 0.86 and an RMSE value of 0.056 cm 3 /cm 3 are achieved at a global scale, respectively. Furthermore, the extensive temporal and spatial variations of CYGNSS SM predictions are evaluated. It shows that the reflectivity plays a main role among the predictors in SM estimation, and the next is vegetation. In some extremely dry places, the roughness may become more important. The value of SM is positively correlated with RMSE and also another limit condition that will constrain the variation of predictors, thus affecting correlation coefficient R and RMSE. Also, we compare both SMAP and CYGNSS SM predictions against in situ SM measurements from 301 stations. Similar low-median unbiased RMSEs are obtained, and the daily averaged CYGNSS-based SM against the in situ networks is 0.049 cm 3 /cm 3 .

This solution can take advantages of both the paradigms. On one hand, higher performance can be expected introducing machine learning (ML) methods based on the training by examples philosophy into VO approaches. On other hand, the combination of VO techniques with DCNNs can aid the generalization ability of these latter. In particular, we formulate a $\\\\ell _2$ -based proximal deep injection term to evaluate the distance between the DCNN outcome, and the desired high spatial resolution multispectral image. This represents the regularization term for our VO model. Furthermore, a new data fitting term measuring the spatial fidelity is proposed. Finally, the proposed convex VO problem is efficiently solved by exploiting the framework of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), thus guaranteeing the convergence of the algorithm.

In this study, five ML algorithms were compared to identify the composition of tree species with multitemporal Sentinel-2 images in the JianShe forest farm, Northeast China. Three major types of deep neural networks [Conv1D, AlexNet, and long short-term memory (LSTM)] were tested to classify Sentinel-2 time series, which represent three disparate but effective strategies to apply sequential data. The other two models are support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which are renowned for extensive adoption and high performance for various remote sensing applications.

However, its applicability is limited, partially due to its coarse spatial resolution (i.e., 1 km). In this study, an Adaptive random forest regression (ARFR) method was developed for LST downscaling at national scale. This study also provided a framework to shift from downscaling single-time image sets to extensive time-series of MOD11A1 LST images in an operational approach (i.e., a 19-years spatiotemporal LST trend analysis over Iran) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The performance of ARFR was assessed by comparing the results of the downscaled LSTs with the Landsat-8 LST data on different dates of six consecutive years (2014-2019) over ten different sub-areas in Iran.

A synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) is a powerful method for measuring and reconstructing the ground displacement. In this article, a total of 19 descending orbit X -band TerraSAR-X and 16 ascending orbit C -band Sentinel-1 images were integrated to monitor the ground displacement of a coal mining area in Yu County (Hebei Province, China) using a small baseline subset (SBAS-InSAR) algorithm. We found that the SBAS-InSAR technology can obtain reliable results in regions without a high gradient deformation by combining the deformation rates derived from both the TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 datasets. The maximum subsidence rate was approximately 125 mm/y between 17 June 2015 and 07 January 2016. In the case of large-gradient deformation, it is indeed difficult to obtain the mining-induced surface subsidence information accurately using the conventional multitemporal (MT-InSAR) techniques owing to the limitations of the SAR wavelength. In response to this problem, a new decision-making fusion method based on SBAS-InSAR and offset tracking was developed to monitor the large-gradient settlement in mining areas. The results show that the method developed compensates for the shortcomings of the traditional MT-InSAR technologies in the field of large-gradient deformation and obtains reliable results.': 1,\n"," 'It is often difficult to detect the targets of interest via the line-of-sight (LOS) signals in the urban environment, since the LOS signals might be not available because of the presence of the walls.

However, high-dimensional HSI dataset versus limited training samples is easy to cause the overfitting phenomenon in deep neural networks. Additionally, the intraclass distance of the embedding features extracted through the softmax-based CNNs may be greater than that of the interclass, which makes it difficult to further improve the classification accuracy. To address these issues, this article proposes a deep prototypical network with hybrid residual attention, which can effectively investigate the spectral-spatial information in the HSI. Specifically, in order to improve the generalization capability of the model, feature extraction with a hybrid residual attention module is presented to enhance the critical spectral-spatial features and suppress the useless ones in the classification task. Furthermore, a novel discriminant distance-based cross-entropy loss is proposed to increase the intraclass compactness, to obtain more superior results. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets are carried out to convincingly evaluate the proposed framework. With the generation of optimal prototypes representing each class and more discriminative embedding features, encouraging classification results are achieved compared with state-of-the-art methods.': 1,\n"," 'In recent years, well-designed terminal-based methods for collecting index data have gradually replaced traditional pen-and-paper methods and have been extensively used in numerous studies. These new approaches offer users increased accuracy, efficiency, consumption, and data compatibility compared to traditional methods.

Thus, a system for the investigation of arable land quality indices that has the flexibility to utilize various types of spatial data and quality indices without requiring program modification is needed. This paper presents the framework, the module partition, and the structure of the data exchange interface for a highly flexible mobile GIS-based system, which we call the “arable land quality index data collection system” (ALQIDCS).

Unlike traditional methods for drawing LIM, the proposed DP-FCN directly draws LIMs from the bitemporal aerial images with VHR through a trained deep neural network without generating the change magnitude map. Thus, the proposed approach can effectively reduce the effects of pseudo changes caused by phenological differences rather than landslide events. The proposed DP-FCN model contains two modules, namely, deep feature extraction, and joint feature learning networks. Deep feature extraction aims to reduce redundancy while extracting the high-level deep features from bitemporal images. Joint feature learning establishes the relationship between the deep features of bitemporal images and the ground reference map. Experiments on the real datasets of the landslide sites in Lantau Island of Hong Kong, China, demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed approach in drawing LIM with VHR remote sensing images. Moreover, compared with the results obtained by the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed DP-FCN method achieves the best performance in terms of accuracy for landslide inventory mapping.': 1,\n"," 'Object detection in remote sensing images is challenging due to the dense distribution and arbitrary angle of the objects. It is a consensus that the oriented bounding box (OBB) is more suitable to represent the aerial objects. However, there are some extreme cases in regression-based OBB detection that make the regression target discontinuous, resulting in the poor performance. In this article, an analysis of the formats of OBB and the problems in its regression is presented, following with an exploration of transform localization from regression to keypoint estimation, which could be applied to avoid the problem of discontinuous regression target. Our novel method is called Object-wise Point-guided Localization Detector (OPLD). Continuously, a new prediction of center-point is introduced to refine the results, as the truncation problem caused by the cut graph. Lastly, in order to figure the problem of inconsistency between the localization quality and the classification score, both the endpoint scores and the classification score are adopted weighting as a result score.

To solve this problem, a local binary patterns and superpixel-based multiple kernels method is proposed for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. First, the original HSI is segmented into multiple superpixels by using the entropy rate superpixel segmentation algorithm. On the HSI with superpixel index, the spectral kernel is second obtained by combining the spectral feature map with the radial basis kernel (RBF). By introducing local binary pattern (LBP) and weighted average filtering into RBF, the spatial kernels are obtained within and among superpixels. Finally, the combined kernel containing the abovementioned three kernels is inputted into the support vector machine classifier to generate a classification map. The experimental procedure in this article uses LBP to extract the information in superpixels, which effectively prevents the loss of edge features in superpixels. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art classifiers for HSI classification.': 1,\n"," 'Ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a significant and challenging task. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks have been applied to solve the detection problem and made a great breakthrough. Previous works mostly rely on the manually designed anchor boxes to search for the region of interests, which is less flexible and suffers from a heavy computational load. Moreover, these detectors have limited performance in large-scale and complex scenes due to the strong interference of inshore background and the variability of object imaging characteristics. In this article, a novel ship detection method based on the scattering-keypoint-guided network is proposed to remedy these problems. First, an anchor-free network is built to eliminate the effect of anchor boxes, in which a more robust representation scheme is designed for the arbitrary oriented objects. Second, a context-aware feature selection module is introduced to dynamically learn both local and context features. In this process, the semantic information of objects can be enhanced while suppressing the background interference. Third, according to the SAR imaging mechanism, a set of scattering keypoints is defined to describe the local scattering regions and reflect the discriminative structural characteristics of ships. Based on this conception, a novel feature adaption method is proposed with the purpose of dealing with the imaging variability issue. Furthermore, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed improvements, we build the Gaofen-3 ship detection dataset.

In recent years, hyperspectral unmixing algorithms based on tensor factorization have emerged, but these decomposition processes may be inconsistent with physical mechanism of unmixing. To solve this problem, this article proposes a sparse and low-rank constrained tensor factorization unmixing algorithm based on a matrix-vector nonnegative tensor factorization (MV-NTF) framework. Considering the fact that each component tensor obtained by the image decomposition contains only one endmember and the corresponding abundance matrix has sparse property, a sparse constraint is imposed to ensure the accuracy of abundance maps. Since abundance maps also have low-rank attribute, in order to avoid the strict low-rank constraint in the original MV-NTF framework, a low-rank tensor regularization is introduced to flexibly express the low-rank characteristics of the abundance tensors, making the resulting abundance maps more in line with the actual scene. Then, the optimization problem is solved by using the alternating direction method of multipliers. In experiments, simulated datasets are adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the sparse and low-rank constraints of the proposed algorithm, and real datasets from different sensors and different scenarios are used to verify its applicability.': 1,\n"," 'This article presents the FMPL-2 on board the FSSCat mission, the 2017 ESA Small Sentinel Satellite Challenge and overall Copernicus Masters Competition winner.

Therefore, a spectral-spatial hyperspectral anomaly detection method is proposed in this article, which is based on fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) and saliency weighted collaborative representation. First, hyperspectral pixels are projected to the fractional Fourier domain by the FrFT, which can enhance the capability of the detector to suppress the noise and make anomalies to be more distinctive. Then, a saliency weighted matrix is designed as the regularization matrix referring to context-aware saliency theory and combined with the FrFT-based collaborative representation detector. The saliency-weighted regularization matrix assigns different pixels with different weights by using both spectral and spatial information, which can reduce the influence of the potential anomalous pixels embedded in the background when applying collaborative representation theory. Finally, to further improve the performance of the proposed method, a spectral-spatial detection procedure is employed to calculate final anomaly scores by using both spectral information and spatial information.

The two major objectives in SAR-based remote sensing of sea ice are, on the one hand, to have a large coverage and, on the other hand, to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible in order to characterize sea ice. Single-polarimetric acquisitions of existing sensors offer a wide coverage on the ground, whereas dual polarimetric or even better fully polarimetric data offer a higher information content, which allows for a more reliable automated sea ice analysis at a cost of smaller swath. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric acquisitions with the higher ground coverage of acquisitions with fewer polarimetric channels, hybrid/compact polarimetric acquisitions offer an excellent tradeoff between the mentioned objectives. With the advent of the RISAT-1 satellite platform, we are able to explore the potential of compact dual pol acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consist of two steps. In the first step, we perform a feature extraction followed by a feature evaluation procedure. The resulting feature vectors are then ingested into a trained artificial neural network classifier to arrive at a pixel-wise supervised classification.

The proposed ARCNN is an end-to-end deep learning framework that alleviates the declining-accuracy phenomenon of deep learning models, and it also ranks the correlation and importance of each band in HSIs. Furthermore, the residual blocks connect every other 3-D convolutional layer by using an identity mapping, which facilitates backpropagation of gradients. In order to address the common issue of imbalance between high dimensionality and limited availability of training samples for HSI classification, an attention mechanism and a feature fusion block are investigated to improve the performance of the ARCNN. Finally, some strategies, batch normalization and dropout, are imposed on every convolutional layer to regularize the learning process.

Previously, several BRDF archetypes were distilled from high-quality MODIS BRDF/Albedo products. In this study, we propose a method that largely relies on matching observed multiangular reflectances with the most appropriate of these prior BRDF archetypes to determine the amplitude and shape of the actual surface BRDFs, when directional signatures are insufficient. This method is first evaluated using an assortment of multisource BRDF data sets to demonstrate its viability for surface albedo estimates, and then is applied to airborne wide-angle infrared dual-mode line/area array scanner (WIDAS) from the Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (WATER) campaign in the Heihe River Basin of China in 2008. This algorithm makes use of the linear MODIS BRDF model to determine the BRDF archetypes needed as prior knowledge for intrinsic spectral albedo estimates. The intrinsic spectral albedos are then used to estimate actual spectral albedos by considering the proportion of direct and diffuse solar radiation. A spectral-to-broadband conversion is performed to generate the broadband albedo at shortwave regimes through the use of conversion coefficients derived from extensive radiative transfer simulations. A further validation confirms that the estimated albedos are consistent with in situ field measured albedos over available corn crop sites.

Hyperspectral images (HSIs) greatly promote the development of CD technology because of their high resolution in the spectral domain. However, some traditional CD methods currently applied to low-dimensional and multispectral images cannot adapt to the complex high-dimensional features of the HSIs. In addition, the spectral measurements of the HSI contain a lot of noise and redundancy, which greatly contaminates spectral-only information for CD. In order to fully extract the discriminant features of HSI to improve the accuracy of CD, this article proposes a three-directions spectral-spatial convolution neural network (TDSSC). A novel method for three-direction decomposition of hyperspectral change tensors is proposed-change tensor is decomposed along the spectral direction and two spatial directions to get a single tensor containing the spectral information and two kinds of tensors containing the spectral-spatial information. TDSSC uses 1-D convolution to extract spectral features from the spectral direction as well as reducing the tensor dimension, which helps the latter network to be lightweight and significantly improves the speed of change detection. Also, it uses 2-D convolution to extract spectral-spatial features from two spatial directions of the reduced tensor, and to extract features from different directions to improve the accuracy and Kappa value of CD.

In this paper, linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) is used to extract their respective subpixel land cover composition from bitemporal Landsat images and the accuracy of the fractional covers is assessed with a subpixel confusion matrix at the category level and the map level by comparing with the reference data from high-resolution images. The percent ISA was divided into discrete categories representing different urban development density areas. Mean land surface temperature (LST) is calculated for each ISA category to analyze the thermal characteristics of different levels of development in the urban area of Fuzhou, China. ISA and vegetation variations are also quantified between different ISA categories and different dates. The contribution index is also calculated based on each ISA category to analyze the impact of different landscape patterns on the urban thermal environment. The results show that ISA category is an important determinant of the urban thermal environment. Furthermore, seasonal variations significantly impact the strength of this relationship. In the study area, the contribution indices were highest in the 90%-100% ISA category in summer 2013 and early spring 2001. The analytical methodologies used in this study can help to quantify urban thermal environmental functions under conditions of urban expansion and explore the climate adaptation potential of cities.': 1,\n"," 'Existing deep learning-based remote sensing images semantic segmentation methods require large-scale labeled datasets. However, the annotation of segmentation datasets is often too time-consuming and expensive. To ease the burden of data annotation, self-supervised representation learning methods have emerged recently. However, the semantic segmentation methods need to learn both high-level and low-level features, but most of the existing self-supervised representation learning methods usually focus on one level, which affects the performance of semantic segmentation for remote sensing images. In order to solve this problem, we propose a self-supervised multitask representation learning method to capture effective visual representations of remote sensing images. We design three different pretext tasks and a triplet Siamese network to learn the high-level and low-level image features at the same time. The network can be trained without any labeled data, and the trained model can be fine-tuned with the annotated segmentation dataset. We conduct experiments on Potsdam, Vaihingen dataset, and cloud/snow detection dataset Levir_CS to verify the effectiveness of our methods. Experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively reduce the demand of labeled datasets and improve the performance of remote sensing semantic segmentation. Compared with the recent state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learning methods and the mostly used initialization methods (such as random initialization and ImageNet pretraining), our proposed method has achieved the best results in most experiments, especially in the case of few training data. With only 10% to 50% labeled data, our method can achieve the comparable performance compared with random initialization.

Deep learning has been widely applied in the field of HSI-MSI fusion, which is limited with hardware. In order to break the limits, we construct an unsupervised multiattention-guided network named UMAG-Net without training data to better accomplish HSI-MSI fusion. UMAG-Net first extracts deep multiscale features of MSI by using a multiattention encoding network. Then, a loss function containing a pair of HSI and MSI is used to iteratively update parameters of UMAG-Net and learn prior knowledge of the fused image. Finally, a multiscale feature-guided network is constructed to generate an HR-HSI.

However, there are at least two issues that should be addressed: not all the backgrounds are beneficial, and object information may be suppressed by backgrounds. To address these problems, in this article, we propose the contextual bidirectional enhancement (CBD-E) method to simultaneously remove unexpected background information and enhance objects' features. CBD-E integrates the features of different background regions sequentially in two directions. On the one hand, a gate function is used to filter out unexpected information in the background and thus improve the recall of detection. On the other hand, a spatial-group-based visual attention mechanism is adopted to enhance the features of objects to reduce the false alarm. The gate function provides an approach to selecting meaningful information in the background, while the spatial-group- based visual attention mechanism enhances the information control ability of the gate function. In the experiments, we have validated the effectiveness of both the gate function and the visual attention mechanism and further demonstrated that the proposed contextual fusion strategy performs well on two published data sets.\": 1,\n"," 'Since the rise of deep learning in the past few years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have quickly found their place within the remote sensing (RS) community.

And conventional methods often used fixed-size convolution kernels that only consider the local area with fixed sizes, thus largely ignoring the global information. In response to the above problems, this article constructs a triplet nonlocal neural network (T-NLNN) model that combines deep metric learning and nonlocal operation. The proposed T-NLNN follows the three-branch network design, with shared weights in each branch. We evaluate T-NLNN on three public high-resolution remote sensing datasets, and the experimental results suggest that T-NLNN has discriminative feature learning ability and outperforms other existing algorithms. In addition, we propose a dual-anchor triplet loss function to facilitate the utilization of information in the input samples. The experimental results prove that the proposed dual-anchor triplet loss function works better than the traditional triplet loss function on all datasets.': 1,\n"," 'Water color is an important parameter in water quality assessment. However, the existing water color investigations have mostly focused on the lakes with areas greater 1 km 2 . In order to improve the understanding of the color of water bodies in China, a cloud-free composite image of China for the summer of 2015 was generated using time-series of Landsat-8 imagery and the best-available-pixel (BAP) compositing algorithm. Then, the first Forel–Ule index (FUI) water color product with a resolution of 30 m was produced for China using the generated BAP composite and the Google Earth Engine computing platform. Finally, the first national-scale assessment of the FUI of natural lakes with an area >0.01 km 2 ( N  = 60026) was conducted based on the generated FUI product. The generated FUI product was shown to have a high degree of consistency with in situ water surface reflectance-derived FUI (R 2  = 0.90, P  < 0.001).

Besides, the proportion of small lakes (areas < 1 km 2 ) found to be yellow was much larger than for large lakes (area ≥ 1 km 2 ) (50% against 28%).

Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in both tasks. However, DCNN-based methods learn to accumulate contextual information over large receptive fields while lose the local detailed information, resulting in blurry object boundaries. The complicated ground object distribution and low interclass variance further aggravate the difficulty in generating accurate predictions. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel boundary-aware multitask learning (BAMTL) framework to perform three tasks, semantic segmentation, height estimation, and boundary detection, within a unified model. The boundary detection is employed as an auxiliary task to regularize the other two master tasks at both the feature space and output space. We present a boundary attentive module to build the cross-task interaction for master tasks, which enforce the networks to filter out the confident area and focus on learning the high-frequency details. We then introduce a boundary regularized loss term to further refine the prediction maps to be locally consistent while preserving boundary structures. With these formulations, our model improves the performance of both segmentation and height tasks, especially along the boundaries.

Therefore, in this article, we propose an attribute-guided multi-scale prototypical network (AG-MsPN) combined with subband decomposition for few-shot SAR target classification, aiming to learn more discriminative features from a few labeled data. Since the SAR images are essentially complex-valued images containing both amplitude and phase information, we implement the subband decomposition of complex-valued SAR images to explore the backscattering variations of targets, thus obtaining more complete descriptions of targets. Then, considering the complementary features extracted by different convolutional layers, based on the prototypical network, a multi-scale prototypical network (MsPN) is proposed to fuse the features of different layers to enhance the discrimination of feature representations, thus relieving the problem of high intra-class diversity and inter-class similarity for the images of SAR targets. Besides, we devise the prior binary attributes of SAR targets and add an extra attribute classification module (ACM) into the MsPN to map the images into the attribute space for classification. During the training phase, the proposed MsPN and the ACM are jointly utilized to realize the target classification in both the feature space and the attribute space, and meanwhile, the model parameters are optimized by the joint loss. Thus, the classification performance of the MsPN is further enhanced under the joint supervision of class label information from a few labeled data and the target attribute information from the prior knowledge. Therefore, we name the proposed method the AG-MsPN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed AG-MsPN on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition benchmark dataset, and our method surpasses many other existing methods in the few-shot cases.': 1,\n"," 'Identifying urban functional zones is of great significance for understanding urban structure and urban planning. The rapid growth and open accessibility of multisource big data, including remote sensing imagery and social sensing data, lead to a new way for dynamic identification of urban functional zones.

From these three perspectives, rich information hidden in urban zone is excavated for function identification. Convolutional neural networks are used to extract high-level scene information from remote sensing images with different resolutions. Object features comprising a series of building indicators are constructed by measuring the area, perimeter, floor number, and year of the building.

In fact, categories of HRRS images depend on regions containing class-specific ground objects, while most of the existing methods for HRRS image scene classification only focus on global information, which introduces redundant information and results in the poor performance of HRRS image scene classification. To overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods, an attention mechanism-based convolutional neural network with multiaugmented schemes is proposed in this article. In the proposed method, augmentation operations over attention mechanism feature maps are used to force the model to capture class-specific features and eliminate redundant information and push the model to capture discriminative regions as much as possible, instead of using all global information without favor. Moreover, a bilinear pooling is utilized to expand the interclass discrimination. Still, feature center loss motivated by center loss is applied to narrow the intraclass gap. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed end-to-end model, three benchmarks are used for testing, and the experimental results have proven the superiority of the proposed method, compared with current state-of-the-art end-to-end methods for HRRS image scene classification.': 1,\n"," 'The small size of labeled samples has always been one of the great challenges in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification.

In this article, we put forward a cross-scene deep transfer learning method with spectral feature adaptation for HSI classification, which transfers the effective contents from source scene to target scene. The proposed framework contains two parts. First, the distribution differences of spectral dimension between source domain and target domain are reduced through a joint probability distribution adaptation approach. Then, a multiscale spectral-spatial unified network with two-branch architecture and a multiscale bank is designed to extract discriminating features of HSI adequately. Finally, classification of the target image is achieved by applying a model-based deep transfer learning strategy.

In the process of HSI classification, the extraction of spectral–spatial features directly influences the classification results. In recent years, the hyperspectral classification method based on convolutional neural networks has demonstrated excellent performance. However, as the network structure deepens, degradation occurs, and the features learned from the fixed-scale convolutional kernels are usually specific, which is not conducive to feature learning and thus impairs the classification accuracy. To solve the problem of difficult extraction of features and underutilization of information from HSI data, a densely connected multiscale attention network based on 3-D convolution is proposed for HSI classification. First, to reduce the spectral redundancy of the HSIs, the principal component analysis algorithm is performed on the raw HSI data; then, several multiscale blocks comprised of parallel factorized spatial–spectral convolution modules of different sizes are adopted to extract the enriched spectral–spatial features from HSIs; furthermore, dense connections are introduced to further fuse features obtained from blocks of different depths, thereby enhancing feature reuse and propagation and helping to alleviate the problem of vanishing gradients. Besides, the channel-spectral-spatial attention block is put forward to spontaneously reweight the fused features to emphasize the features that are more relevant to the classification results while weakening the less relevant ones. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in extracting discriminative features of the target and outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.': 1,\n"," 'Determining the land surface temperature (LST) variations in urban surfaces using high spatiotemporal resolution thermal infrared data is necessary for urban microthermal environmental modeling.

The enhanced encoder and the dual-stage decoder, composed of the CBM and the SSPD module, extract and recover the crucial multiscale information better. Second, we design the multilayer SSPD module based on the selective spatial attention. The multiscale building information with different attention on multiple branches is combined, optimized, and adaptively selected for adaptive filtering and extracting features of complex multiscale building targets in SAR images. Third, according to the building features and SAR imaging mechanism, a new loss function called L-shape weighting loss (LWloss) is proposed to heighten the attention on the L-shape footprint characteristics of the buildings and reduce the missing detection of line buildings. Besides, LWloss can also alleviate the class imbalance problem in the optimization stage.

This is the big difference from most existing pan-sharpening methods. Moreover, the loss function takes into account the characteristics of remote sensing images, including the spatial and spectral evaluation indicators.

Among the widely used global monitoring satellite sensors, Landsat data have a coarse temporal resolution, but fine spatial resolution, while moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have fine temporal resolution, but coarse spatial resolution. One solution to this problem is to blend the two types of data using spatio-temporal fusion, creating images with both fine temporal and fine spatial resolution. However, reliable geometric registration of images acquired by different sensors is a prerequisite of spatio-temporal fusion. Due to the potentially large differences between the spatial resolutions of the images to be fused, the geometric registration process always contains some degree of uncertainty. This article analyzes quantitatively the influence of geometric registration error on spatio-temporal fusion. The relationship between registration error and the accuracy of fusion was investigated under the influence of different temporal distances between images, different spatial patterns within the images and using different methods (i.e., spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), and Fit-FC; two typical spatio-temporal fusion methods). The results show that registration error has a significant impact on the accuracy of spatio-temporal fusion; as the registration error increased, the accuracy decreased monotonically. The effect of registration error in a heterogeneous region was greater than that in a homogeneous region. Moreover, the accuracy of fusion was not dependent on the temporal distance between images to be fused, but rather on their statistical correlation. Finally, the Fit-FC method was found to be more accurate than the STARFM method, under all registration error scenarios.': 1,\n"," 'Soil moisture ocean salinity (SMOS) mission has been providing L-band multiangular brightness temperature observations at a global scale since its launch in November 2009 and has performed well in the retrieval of soil moisture.

Radio-frequency interference (RFI) issues and aliasing at lower look angles increase the uncertainty of observations and thereby affect the soil moisture retrieval that utilizes observations at specific angles. In this study, we proposed a two-step regression approach that uses a mixed objective function based on SMOS L1c data products to refine characteristics of multiangular observations. The approach was found to be robust by validation using simulations from a radiative transfer model, and valuable in improving soil moisture estimates from SMOS.

Usually, the mixed pixels can be approximated using a linear mixing model. Since each material only occurs in a few pixels in real HSI, sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), and its extensions are widely used as solutions. Some recent works assume that materials are distributed in certain structures, which can be added as constraints to sparse NMF model. However, they only consider the spatial distribution within a local neighborhood and define the distribution structure manually, while ignoring the real distribution of materials that is diverse in different images. In this article, we propose a new unmixing method that learns a subspace structure from the original image and incorporate it into the sparse NMF framework to promote unmixing performance. Based on the self-representation property of data points lying in the same subspace, the learned subspace structure can indicate the global similar graph of pixels that represents the real distribution of materials. Then the similar graph is used as a robust global spatial prior which is expected to be maintained in the decomposed abundance matrix.

Powerful learning-based discriminative features play an essential role in content-based remote sensing image retrieval (CBRSIR). Cross-source CBRSIR (CS-CBRSIR) is used to find relevant remote sensing images across different remote sensing sources (i.e., multispectral images and panchromatic images). But it is limited by large cross-source and intrasource variations caused by different semantic objects, spatial resolution, and spectral resolution. The main limitation of CS-CBRSIR is that it cannot address the inconsistency between different sources and exploit the intrinsic relation between them. This study proposes a discriminative distillation network for CS-CBRSIR to address this limitation. To enlarge the interclass variations and reduce the intraclass differences, the discriminative features from the first source are first extracted with a well-designed joint optimization configuration (JOC) on the basis of deep neural networks. Thereafter, the features extracted from the first source are used as a supervision signal for the second source; feature distribution in common feature space between the first and second sources are made significantly similar.

In this regard, several conventional model-based methods use scattering power components to analyze polarimetric SAR data. However, the typical hierarchical process to enumerate power components uses various branching conditions, leading to several limitations. These techniques assume ad hoc scattering models within a radar resolution cell. Therefore, the use of several models makes the computation of scattering powers ambiguous. Some common issues of model-based decompositions are related to the compensation of the orientation angle about the radar line of sight and the occurrence of negative power components. We propose a model-free four-component scattering power decomposition that alleviates these issues. In the proposed approach, we use the nonconventional 3-D Barakat degree of polarization to obtain the polarization state of scattered electromagnetic wave. The degree of polarization is used to obtain the even-bounce, odd-bounce, and diffused scattering power components. Along with this, a measure of target scattering asymmetry is also proposed, which is then suitably utilized to obtain the helicity power. All the power components are roll-invariant, nonnegative, and unambiguous. In addition to this, we propose an unsupervised clustering technique that preserves the dominance of the scattering power components for different targets. This clustering technique assists in understanding the importance of diverse scattering mechanisms based on target characteristics. The technique adequately captures the clusters' variations from one target to another according to their physical and geometrical properties.

The keypoints matched between subject and reference images represent possible unchanged regions and form a radiometric control set (RCS). The initial RCS is further refined by removing the matched keypoints with a low cross-correlation. The final RCS is used to approximate a linear mapping between the corresponding bands of the subject and reference images. This procedure is validated on five datasets of unregistered multispectral image pairs acquired by inter/intra sensors in terms of RRN accuracy, visual quality, quality, and quantity of the samples in the RCS, and computational time. The experimental results show that keypoint-based RRN is robust against variations in spatial-resolution, illumination, and sensors. The blob detectors (SURF, SIFT, KAZE, and AKAZE) are more accurate on average than the corner detectors (ORB and BRISK) in RRN, with an expense of higher computational cost.

At present, the existing extraction methods of glacial lakes based on Landsat remote sensing image have achieved remarkable results, but the algorithms used lack the ability to analyze glacial lake spectral and shape and texture features, and require manual design parameters to fine tune the automation of the algorithm. As a result, it cannot mine the depth features of glacier lakes in remote sensing images accurately enough. To address these challenges, this study designed a self-attention mechanism module U-net network that enhances the propagation of features, reduces information loss, strengthens the weight of glacial lake areas, restrains the weight of irrelevant features, reduces the influence of low image contrast on the model, and deals with the variety of pixel categories in glacial lakes. These features improve the performance of the model. Based on Landsat-8 images, we first extracted glacial lakes in large-scale alpine areas using a U-net network model. To make it a self-attention U-net network, we introduced the attention mechanism into the step connection part of the U-net network to adjust feature weight, focus on learning glacial lake features, and strengthen the network to extract the glacial lake features. Finally, we selected the combination of bands 3, 5, and 6 and all bands of Landsat-8 images sing the self-attention U-net network to extract glacial lakes in the study area and compared and analyzed the extraction results. The experimental results and analyses revealed that the proposed method can effectively segment glacial lakes from Landsat-8 remote sensing images. Its effectiveness was proven by different evaluation indices. Compared with a standard U-net network, the true positive for the combination of 3, 5, and 6 bands increased by 15.95% and for all bands by 5.79%. The area under curve for the whole study area reached 85.03% for all bands. The improved U-net network can, thus, meet the real time needs of glacial lake disaster information acquisition.': 1,\n"," 'Recent developments in hyperspectral sensors have made it possible to acquire hyperspectral images (HSI) with higher spectral and spatial resolution. Hence, it is now possible to extract detailed information about relatively smaller structures. Despite these advantages, HSI suffers from many challenges also, like higher spatial variability of spectral signatures, the Hughes effect due to higher dimensionality, and a limited number of labeled training samples compared to the dimensions of the spectral space. Superpixels can be a potentially effective tool in tackling these challenges. Superpixel segmentation is a process of segmenting the spatial image into several semantic subregions with similar characteristic features. Such grouping by similarity can significantly ease the subsequent processing steps. Because of this, superpixels have been successfully applied to various fields of HSI processing such as classification, spectral unmixing, dimensionality reduction, band selection, active learning (AL), denoising, and anomaly detection. This article focuses on classification, presenting a detailed survey of superpixel segmentation approaches for the classification of HSI. The superpixel creation algorithm framework and postprocessing frameworks for superpixels in HSI are also analyzed. Also, a brief description of various application areas of superpixels is provided. An experimental analysis of existing superpixel segmentation approaches is also provided in this article, supported by quantitative results on standard benchmark datasets. The challenges and future research directions for the implementation of superpixel algorithms are also discussed.': 1,\n"," 'In this article, an effective schematic is developed for estimating sea ice thickness (SIT) from the reflectivity (Γ) produced with TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry data. Here, Γ is formulated as the product of the propagation loss due to SIT and the reflection coefficient of underlying seawater. The effect of surface roughness on Γ is neglected when only considering signals of coherent reflection. In practice, Γ at the specular point is first generated using TDS-1 data. Afterwards, SIT is calculated from TDS-1 Γ based on the proposed reflectivity model, and verified with two sets of reference SIT data; one is obtained by the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, and the other is the combined SMOS/Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) measurements. This analysis is performed on the data with SIT less than 1m. Through comparison, good consistency between the derived TDS-1 SIT and the reference SIT is obtained, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.84 and a root-mean-square difference (RMSD) of 9.39 cm with SMOS, and an r of 0.67 and an RMSD of 9.49 cm with SMOS/SMAP, which demonstrates the applicability of the developed model and the utility of TDS-1 data for SIT estimation. In addition, this method is proved to be useful for improving existing sea ice detection accuracy.': 1,\n"," 'The automatic extraction of buildings from high-resolution aerial imagery plays a significant role in many urban applications. Recently, the convolution neural network (CNN) has gained much attention in remote sensing field and achieved a remarkable performance in building segmentation from visible aerial images. However, most of the existing CNN-based methods still have the problem of tending to produce predictions with poor boundaries. To address this problem, in this article, a novel semantic segmentation neural network named edge-detail-network (E-D-Net) is proposed for building segmentation from visible aerial images. The proposed E-D-Net consists of two subnetworks E-Net and D-Net. On the one hand, E-Net is designed to capture and preserve the edge information of the images. On the other hand, D-Net is designed to refine the results of E-Net and get a prediction with higher detail quality. Furthermore, a novel fusion strategy, which combines the outputs of the two subnetworks is proposed to integrate edge information with fine details. Experimental results on the INRIA aerial image labeling dataset and the ISPRS Vaihingen 2-D semantic labeling dataset demonstrate that, compared with the existing CNN-based model, the proposed E-D-Net provides noticeably more robust and higher building extraction performance, thus making it a useful tool for practical application scenarios.': 1,\n"," 'Soil moisture is vital for the crop growth and directly affects the crop yield. The conventional synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based soil moisture monitoring is often influenced by vegetation cover and surface roughness. The machine-learning methods are not constrained by physical parameters and have high nonlinear fitting capabilities. In this study, machine-learning methods were applied to estimate soil moisture over winter wheat fields during its growing season. RADARSAT-2 data with quad polarizations and 240 sample plots in the study area were acquired and collected, respectively. In addition to the four linear polarization channels, polarimetric decomposition parameters were extracted to expand the SAR feature space. Three advanced machine-learning models were selected and compared, which were support vector regression, random forests (RF), and gradient boosting regression tree. To improve the performances of the models, three feature-selection methods were compared, which were based on Pearson correlation, support vector machine recursive feature elimination, and RF, respectively. The coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were used to compare and assess the performances of those models. The results revealed that polarimetric decomposition parameters were effective in estimating soil moisture, and RF model obtained the highest prediction accuracy (training set: RMSE = 2.44 vol.% and R 2 = 0.94; and validation set: RMSE = 4.03 vol.%, and R 2 = 0.79). This study finally concluded that using polarimetric decomposition parameters combined with machine-learning and feature-selection methods could effectively estimate soil moisture at a high accuracy, which helps monitor soil moisture across the agricultural field during its growing season.': 1,\n"," 'Hot region selection (HRS) is usually performed for larger scenes, especially in military target detection and battlefield situational awareness applications. Many state-of-the-art methods pay more attention on object detection. Although they can detect the region of interest in one image, these images are highly affected by illumination, rotation, and scale changes, which further increases the complexity of analysis compared to those obtained using standard remote sensing platforms. The study of HRS is of great importance in the analysis of remote sensing images. The current research focuses on the specific type of object area detection. A well-developed HRS needs to have three properties: uniform highlighting of the entire HRS, well-defined boundaries, and good robustness. Motivated by these requirements, a HRS method based on the selective search method and modified fuzzy c-means (FCM) in remote sensing images is proposed to address the detection of potential hot regions in large-scale remote sensing images. First, we create a Gaussian curvature filter to preprocess large scale remote sensing images. Second, a modified FCM segmentation method is utilized to segment the image. Third, an enhanced selective search method is adopted to establish well-defined boundaries for the HRS and to improve the immunity to noise. The geographic information is presented in this phase, which is conducive to improve the detection accuracy. In the experimental section, we compare our new method with four other extraction models on three data sets. The experimental results show that compared to the other competing models, the new model better defines the hot regions and obtains more entire boundaries in terms of Overlap and mAP.': 1,\n"," 'Common horizontal bounding box-based methods are not capable of accurately locating slender ship targets with arbitrary orientations in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Therefore, in recent years, methods based on oriented bounding box (OBB) have gradually received attention from researchers. However, most of the recently proposed deep learning-based methods for OBB detection encounter the boundary discontinuity problem in angle or key point regression. In order to alleviate this problem, researchers propose to introduce some manually set parameters or extra network branches for distinguishing the boundary cases, which make training more difficult and lead to performance degradation. In this article, in order to solve the boundary discontinuity problem in OBB regression, we propose to detect SAR ships by learning polar encodings. The encoding scheme uses a group of vectors pointing from the center of the ship target to the boundary points to represent an OBB. The boundary discontinuity problem is avoided by training and inference directly according to the polar encodings. In addition, we propose an intersect over union (IOU)-weighted regression loss, which further guides the training of polar encodings through the IOU metric and improves the detection performance. Comparative experiments on the benchmark Rotating SAR Ship Detection Dataset (RSSDD) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in terms of enhanced detection performance over state-of-the-art algorithms and other OBB encoding schemes.': 1,\n"," 'The article of the freeze/thaw dynamic of high-latitude Earth surfaces is extremely important and informative for monitoring the carbon cycle, the climate change, and the security of infrastructures. Current methodologies mainly rely on the use of active and passive microwave sensors, while very few efforts have been devoted to the assessment of the potential of observations based on signals of opportunity. This article aims at assessing the performance of spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) for high-spatial and high-temporal resolution monitoring of the Earth-surface freeze/thaw state. To this aim, reflectivity values derived from the TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) data have been collected and elaborated, and thus compared against the soil moisture active passive (SMAP) freeze/thaw information. Shallow subsurface soil temperature values recorded by a network of in situ stations have been considered as well. Even if an extensive and timeliness cross availability of both types of experimental data is limited by the spatial coverage and density of TDS-1 observations, the proposed analysis clearly indicates a significant seasonal cycle in the calibrated reflectivity. This opens new perspectives for the bistatic L-band high-resolution satellite monitoring of the freeze/thaw state, as well as to support the development of next-generation of GNSS-R satellite missions designed to provide enhanced performance and improved temporal and spatial coverage over high latitude areas.': 1,\n"," 'This study deals with coastline extraction using multipolarization spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery acquired over coastal intertidal areas. The latter are very challenging environments where mud flats lead to a large variability of normalized radar cross section, which may trigger a significant number of false edges during the extraction process. The performance of SAR-based coastline extraction methods that rely on a joint combination of multipolarization information (either single- or dual-polarization metrics) and speckle filtering (either local and nonlocal approaches) are analyzed using global positioning system (GPS) samples and colocated SAR imagery collected under different incidence angles. Our test site is an intertidal zone with a wetland (i.e., salt marsh) in the Solway Firth, south-west along the Scottish-English border. Experimental results, obtained processing a pair of RadarSAT-2 full-polarimetric and a pair of Sentinel-1 dual-polarimetric SAR imagery augmented by colocated GPS samples, show that: first, the multipolarization information outperforms the single-polarization counterpart in terms of extraction accuracy; second, among the single-polarization channels, the cross-polarized one performs best; third, both single- and dual-polarization methods perform better when nonlocal speckle filtering is applied; fourth, the joint combination of nonlocal speckle filter and dual-polarization information provides the best accuracy; and finally, the incidence angle plays a role in the extraction accuracy with larger incidence angles resulting in the best performance when dual-polarization metric is used.': 1,\n"," 'Building footprint segmentation from high-resolution remote sensing (RS) images plays a vital role in urban planning, disaster response, and population density estimation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been recently used as a workhorse for effectively generating building footprints. However, to completely exploit the prediction power of CNNs, large-scale pixel-level annotations are required. Most state-of-the-art methods based on CNNs are focused on the design of network architectures for improving the predictions of building footprints with full annotations, while few works have been done on building footprint segmentation with limited annotations. In this article, we propose a novel semisupervised learning method for building footprint segmentation, which can effectively predict building footprints based on the network trained with few annotations (e.g., only $\\\\text{0.0324 {km}}^2$ out of $\\\\text{2.25-{km}}^2$ area is labeled). The proposed method is based on investigating the contrast between the building and background pixels in latent space and the consistency of predictions obtained from the CNN models when the input RS images are perturbed. Thus, we term the proposed semisupervised learning framework of building footprint segmentation as PiCoCo , which is based on the enforcement of Pi xelwise Co ntrast and Co nsistency during the learning phase. Our experiments, conducted on two benchmark building segmentation datasets, validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework as compared to several state-of-the-art building footprint extraction and semisupervised semantic segmentation methods.': 1,\n"," \"Submeter high-resolution remote sensing image land cover classification could provide significant help for urban monitoring, management, and planning. Deep learning (DL)-based models have achieved remarkable performance in many land cover classification tasks through end-to-end supervised learning. However, the excellent performance of DL-based models relies heavily on a large number of well-annotated samples, which is impossible in practical land cover classification scenarios. Additionally, the training set could contain all of the different land cover types. To overcome these problems, in this article, a semisupervised multiple-CNN ensemble learning method, namely semi-MCNN, is proposed to solve the land cover classification problem. Considering the lack of labeled samples, a semisupervised learning strategy was adopted to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data. In the proposed approach, an automatic sample selection method called an ensembled teacher model dataset generation was adopted to select samples and generate a dataset from large amounts of unlabeled data automatically. To tackle the error propagation problem, an important strategy was adopted to correct the errors by pretraining on the selected unlabeled data, and fine-tuning on the labeled data. Moreover, the semisupervised idea together with the multi-CNN ensemble framework was integrated into an end-to-end architecture. This could significantly improve the generalization ability of the semisupervised model, as well as the classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted on Shenzhen's land cover data and two other public remote sensing datasets. These experiments confirmed the superior performance of the proposed semi-MCNN compared to the state-of-the-art land cover classification models.\": 1,\n"," 'The remote sensing scene images classification has been of great value to civil and military fields. Deep learning models, especially the convolutional neural network (CNN), have achieved great success in this task, however, they may suffer from two challenges: first, the sizes of the category objects are usually different, but the conventional CNN extracts the features with fixed convolution extractor, which could cause the failure in learning the multiscale features; second, some image regions may not be useful during the feature learning process, therefore, how to guide the network to select and focus on the most relevant regions is crucially vital for remote sensing scene image classification. To address these two challenges, we propose a multiscale attention network (MSA-Network), which integrates a multiscale (MS) module and a channel and position attention (CPA) module to boost the performance of the remote sensing scene classification. The proposed MS module learns multiscale features by adopting various sizes of sliding windows from different depths’ layers and receptive fields. The CPA module is composed of two parts: the channel attention (CA) module and the position attention (PA) one. The CA module learns the global attention features from channel-level, and the PA module extracts the local attention features from pixel-level. Thus, fusing both of those two attention features, the network is apt to focus on the more critical and salient regions automatically. Extensive experiments on UC Merced, AID, NWPU-RESISC45 datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSA-Network outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.': 1,\n"," 'Semantic segmentation of aerial videos has been extensively used for decision making in monitoring environmental changes, urban planning, and disaster management.

However, it can be challenging to obtain reference data associated to such images to deal with land use or land cover changes as often the nature of the phenomena under study is not known a priori. With the aim to deal with satellite image analysis, considering a real-world scenario, where reference data cannot be available, in this article, we present a novel end-to-end unsupervised approach for change detection and clustering for satellite image time series (SITS). In the proposed framework, we first create bitemporal change masks for every couple of consecutive images using neural network autoencoders (AEs). Then, we associate the extracted changes to different spatial objects. The objects sharing the same geographical location are combined in spatiotemporal evolution graphs that are finally clustered accordingly to the type of change process with gated recurrent unit (GRU) AE-based model.

The classical shadow-aided detection was applied in video SAR, and most recently, the deep learning approach has been developed for shadow-aided moving target detection. This article presents a joint moving target detection approach for video SAR using a dual faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN), which algorithmically combines the shadow detection in the SAR image and the Doppler energy detection in the range-Doppler (RD) spectrum domain, and this new approach can suppress false alarm sufficiently. Video SAR image and its corresponding low resolution RD spectrum are fed into the developed dual Faster R-CNN. A correct detection can be achieved if the shadow of a moving target and its Doppler energy are simultaneously detected by paired region proposals, which are obtained by sharing the region proposals of two independent region proposal networks (RPNs). Therefore, the performance of moving target detection can be significantly improved by using diverse features in different domains. This proposed approach has been verified by both the simulated and real video SAR data. Compared to other classical methods, our approach exhibits a great detection performance in terms of fewer false alarms and acceptable missing alarms.': 1,\n"," 'Road extraction is an important task in remote sensing image information extraction. Recently, deep learning semantic segmentation has become an important method of road extraction. Due to the impact of the loss of multiscale spatial features, the results of road extraction still contain incomplete or fractured results. In this article, we proposed a deep learning model, which is called the dense-global-residual network that reduces the loss of spatial information and enhances context awareness. In the dense-global-residual network, the residual network is used to extract the features at different levels. To obtain more abundant multiscale features, a dense and global spatial pyramid pooling module based on Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling is built to perceive and aggregate the contextual information. The proposed method obtains better results on the GF-2 road dataset and public Massachusetts road dataset of aerial imagery. In order to prove the effectiveness of our method, we compared with four methods, such as DeepLabV3+, U-net, D-LinkNet, and coord-dense-global model, and found that the accuracy of our method is considerably better. Moreover, the dense-global-residual network can also effectively extract roads, especially trees and building shadows that occlude the road.

However, in 3-D microwave sparse reconstruction application, conventional CS-based algorithms always suffer from huge computational cost. In this article, a novel 3-D microwave sparse reconstruction method based on a complex-valued sparse reconstruction network (CSR-Net) is proposed, which converts complex number operations into matrix operations for real and imaginary parts. Using the unfolding + network approximate scheme, each iteration process of CS-based iterative threshold optimization is designed as a block of CSR-Net, and a modified shrinkage term is introduced to improve the convergence performance of the approach. In addition, CSR-Net adopts a convolutional neural network module to replace a nonlinear sparse representation process, which dramatically reduces computational complexity and improves reconstruction performance over conventional CS-based iterative threshold optimization algorithms. Then, we divide the 3-D scene into a series of 2-D slices, and a phase correction scheme is adopted to ensure that the whole 3-D scene can be reconstructed with measurement matrix of a slice. Moreover, an efficient position-amplitude-random training method without additional real-measured data is employed for the proposed network, which effectively train the CSR-Net without enough real-measured data.

The hand-craft feature engineering in the traditional road extraction methods is unstable, which makes the extracted road centerline deviated from the road center in complex cases and even results in overall extracting errors. Recently, the road centerline extraction methods based on semantic segmentation employing deep neural network greatly outperformed the traditional methods. Nevertheless, the pixel-wise labels for training deep learning models are expensive and the postprocess of road segmentation is error-prone. Inspired by the work of human pose estimation, we propose DeepWindow, a novel method to automatically extract the road network from remote sensing images. DeepWindow uses a sliding window guided by a CNN-based decision function to track the road network directly from the images without the prior of road segmentation. First of all, we design and train a CNN model to estimate the road center points inside a patch. Then, the road seeds are automatically searched patch by patch employing the CNN model. Finally, starting from seeds, our method first estimates the road direction using a Fourier spectrum analysis algorithm and then iteratively tracks the road center-line along the road direction guided by the CNN model. In our method, the CNN model is trained by point annotations, which greatly reduces the training costs comparing to those in semantic model training.

Land-use classification requires up-to-date field boundary maps potentially covering large areas containing thousands of farms. This kind of map is usually difficult to obtain. We have developed a new, automated method for deriving closed polygons around fields from time-series satellite imagery. We have been using this method operationally in New Zealand to map whole districts using imagery from several satellite sensors, with little need to vary parameters. Our method looks for boundaries-either step edges or linear features-surrounding regions of low variability throughout the time series. Local standard deviations from all image dates are combined, and the result is convolved with a series of extended directional edge filters. We propose that edge linearity over a long distance is a more important criterion than spectral difference for separating fields, so edge responses are thresholded primarily by length rather than strength. The resulting raster edge map (combined from all directions) is converted to vector (GIS) format and the final polygon topology is built. The method successfully segments parcels containing different crops and pasture, as well as those separated by boundaries such as roads and hedgerows. Here we describe the technique and demonstrate it for an agricultural study site (4000 km 2 ) using SPOT satellite imagery. We show that our result compares favorably with that from existing segmentation methods in terms of both quantitative quality metrics and suitability for land-use classification.': 1,\n"," 'Plant counting and location are essential for both plant breeding experiments and production agriculture.

In the last decade, statistical methods have gradually exerted their impact on mapping the landslide susceptibility to locate the high-risk places of landslide. However, due to the complexity of getting full access to the thematic information in large scenarios, most of these statistical methods generally suffer from overfitting, inadequate representative power, and the inability to transfer the learned representation to other places. To solve these challenges, this study designed an unsupervised representation learning module, which features independence, compactness, robustness, and transferability. Specifically, we first stack restricted Boltzmann machines and denoising autoencoder to unsupervised discover the underlying representations embedded in the thematic maps. Then, we applied the transferring strategy in an adversarial manner to generalize the learned representations to the sample-scarce area. Experimental results and analyses using data in different regions have revealed that the proposed method can be generalized well between different LSM scenarios. In terms of precision, it outperforms other methods by a large margin, e.g., by around 7% compared to multilayer perceptrons with the same configuration, and by 3%–4% to the state of art algorithm random forest. Besides, compared to other methods, the landslide susceptibility map that is predicted by the proposed method featuring smoothness and stableness seems more reliable, and is more according to some prior knowledge that, for example, distance to the drainage, slope, and stratum, should exert dominant effects on the occurrence of a landslide.': 1,\n"," 'This article aims to investigate how circuit-based hybrid quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be successfully employed as image classifiers in the context of remote sensing.

This is because contrary to computer vision, in remote sensing, training data are harder to collect and targets can be very small, occupying only a few pixels in the entire image, and exhibit arbitrary perspective transformations. Detection performance can improve by fusing data from multiple remote sensing modalities, including red, green, blue, infrared, hyperspectral, multispectral, synthetic aperture radar, and light detection and ranging, to name a few. In this article, we propose YOLOrs: a new convolutional neural network, specifically designed for real-time object detection in multimodal remote sensing imagery. YOLOrs can detect objects at multiple scales, with smaller receptive fields to account for small targets, as well as predict target orientations. In addition, YOLOrs introduces a novel mid-level fusion architecture that renders it applicable to multimodal aerial imagery. Our experimental studies compare YOLOrs with contemporary alternatives and corroborate its merits.': 1,\n"," 'Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are operationally used for the detection of oil spills in the marine environment, as they are independent of sun light and weather-induced phenomena. Exploitation of radar polarimetric features for operational oil spill detection is relatively new and until recently those properties have not been extensively exploited. This paper describes the development of a oil spill detection processing chain using coherent dual-polarimetric (copolarized channels, i.e., HH-VV) TerraSAR-X images. The proposed methodology focuses on offshore platform monitoring and introduces for the first time a combination of traditional and polarimetric features for object-based oil spill detection and look-alike discrimination. A total number of 35 feature parameters were extracted from 225 oil spills and 26 look-alikes and divided into training and validation dataset. Mutual information content among extracted features have been assessed and feature parameters are ranked according to their ability to discriminate between oil spill and look-alike. Extracted features are used for training and validation of a support vector machine-based classifier. Performance estimation was carried out for the proposed methodology on a large dataset with overall classification accuracy of 90% oil spills and 80% for look-alikes. Polarimetric features such as geometric intensity, copolarization power ratio, span proved to be more discriminative than other polarimetric and traditional features.': 1,\n"," 'The problem of determining and understanding the nature of buried objects by means of nondestructive and noninvasive techniques represents an interesting issue for a great variety of applications. In this framework, the theory of electromagnetic inverse scattering problems can help in such an issue by starting from the measures of the scattered field collected on a surface. What will be presented in this communication is a two-dimensional (2-D) technique based on the so-called Born approximation (BA) combined with a compressive sensing (CS) approach, in order to improve reconstruction capabilities for a proper class of targets. The use of a multiview-multistatic configuration will be employed together with a multifrequency approach to overcome the limited amount of data due to the single-frequency technique. Therefore, after a first numerical analysis of the performance of the considered algorithm, some numerical examples for 2-D aspect-limited configurations will be presented. The scenario is composed of a simplified scene, which consists of two half-spaces, and with the probes located close to the interface between the two media. As proposed in the following, it is easy to observe that the use of CS for this kind of problems may improve reconstruction capabilities, confirming the validity of the presented approach.': 1,\n"," 'Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors represent one of the most effective means to support activities in the sector of maritime surveillance. In the field of ship detection, many SAR-based algorithms have been proposed recently, but none of them has ever considered the electromagnetic aspects behind the interactions of SAR signals with the ship and surrounding waters, with the detection step and rate strongly influenced by relative thresholding techniques applied to the SAR amplitude or intensity image. This paper introduces a novel model to evaluate the radar cross section (RCS) backscattered from a canonical ship adapted, to the case at issue, from similar existing models developed for, and applied to, urban areas. The RCS is modeled using the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) within the geometrical optics (GO) solution and, following some assumptions on the scene parameters, derived by empirical observations; its probability density function is derived for all polarizations. An analysis of the sensitiveness of the RCS to the uncertainty on the input scene parameters is then performed. The new model is validated on two different TerraSAR-X images acquired in November 2012 over the Solent area in the U.K.: the RCS relevant to several isolated ships is measured and compared with the expected value deriving from the theoretical model here introduced. Results are widely discussed and ranges of applicability finally suggested.': 1,\n"," 'Maritime activities are essential aspects of human society. Accurate classification of ships is vital for maritime surveillance and meaningful to numerous civil and military applications. However, most studies conducted are limited to the coarse-grained ship classification. Few studies on fine-grained ship classification have been undertaken despite its accuracy and practicability. In this study, we construct a new benchmark for fine-grained ship classification which consists of 23 fine-grained categories of ships. Besides the category label, the benchmark contains several other attribute information. To solve the problem of interclass similarity, an attribute-guided multilevel enhanced feature representation network (AMEFRN) is proposed. Concretely, a multilevel enhanced visual feature representation is designed to fuse the reweighted regional features in order to focus more on the silent region and suppress the other regions. Further to this, considering the complementary role of attribute information in ship identification, an attribute-guided feature extraction branch is proposed, which extracts the auxiliary attribute features by utilizing the attribute information as supervision. Finally, the attribute features and the enhanced visual features jointly function as a feature representation for classification. Compared to other existing classification models, AMEFRN has better performance with an overall accuracy rate of 93.58% on the established fine-grained ship classification dataset. Moreover, it can be easily embedded into most CNN models as well as trained end-to-end.': 1,\n"," 'Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is one of the most commonly used data for terrain products generation. Filtering ground points is a prerequisite step for ALS data processing. Traditional filtering methods mainly use handcrafted features or predefined classification rules with preprocessing/post-processing operations to filter ground points iteratively, which is empirical and cumbersome. Deep learning provides a new approach to solve classification and segmentation problems because of its ability to self-learn features, which has been favored in many fields, particularly remote sensing. In this article, we proposed a point-based fully convolutional neural network (PFCN) which directly consumed points with only geometric information and extracted both point-wise and tile-wise features to classify each point. The network was trained with 37449157 points from 14 sites and evaluated on 6 sites in various forested environments. Additionally, the method was compared with five widely used filtering methods and one of the best point-based deep learning methods (PointNet++). Results showed that the PFCN achieved the best results in terms of mean omission error (T1 = 1.10%), total error (Te = 1.73%), and Kappa coefficient (93.88%), but ranked second for the root mean square error of the digital Terrain model caused by the worst commission error. Additionally, our method was on par with or even better than PointNet++ in accuracy. Moreover, the method consumes one-third of the computational resource and one-seventh of the training time. We believe that PFCN is a simple and flexible method that can be widely applied for ground point filtering.': 1,\n"," 'The shear volumes of data generated from earth observation and remote sensing technologies continue to make major impact; leaping key geospatial applications into the dual data and compute-intensive era. As a consequence, this rapid advancement poses new computational and data processing challenges. We implement a novel remote sensing data flow (RESFlow) for advancing machine learning to compute with massive amounts of remotely sensed imagery. The core contribution is partitioning massive amounts of data into homogeneous distributions for fitting simple models. RESFlow takes advantage of Apache Spark and the availability of modern computing hardware to harness the acceleration of deep learning inference on expansive remote sensing imagery. The framework incorporates a strategy to optimize resource utilization across multiple executors assigned to a single worker. We showcase its deployment in both computationally and data-intensive workloads for pixel-level labeling tasks. The pipeline invokes deep learning inference at three stages; during deep feature extraction, deep metric mapping, and deep semantic segmentation. The tasks impose compute-intensive and GPU resource sharing challenges motivating for a parallelized pipeline for all execution steps. To address the problem of hardware resource contention, our containerized workflow further incorporates a novel GPU checkout routine and the ticketing system across multiple workers. The workflow is demonstrated with NVIDIA DGX accelerated platforms and offers appreciable compute speed-ups for deep learning inference on pixel labeling workloads; processing 21 028 TB of imagery data and delivering output maps at area rate of 5.245 sq.km/s, amounting to 453 168 sq.km/day-reducing a 28 day workload to 21 h.': 1,\n"," 'Pan-sharpening aims at acquiring a multispectral image with a high spatial resolution by fusing a low-resolution multispectral image and a panchromatic image. In order to improve spatial details and reduce spectral distortions, we develop a new pan-sharpening model based on the Bayesian theory, which involves three assumptions: 1) the low-resolution multispectral images are generally decimated from the high-resolution multispectral images by convolution with a blurring kernel; 2) different from most pan-sharpening methods that use linear manners to preserve spatial information, we attempt a nonlinear manner based on a convolutional neural network composed of the proposed multiscale recursive blocks, and we train our network parameters in multiorder gradient domains to preserve more spatial structures; and 3) we introduce an anisotropic total variation prior in multiorder gradient domains to reconstruct better image edges and details. We establish the posterior probability model based on the above assumptions and derive an efficient optimization scheme to address the proposed objective function. Final experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can overcome the restriction of a linear model and achieve better spectral and spatial fusion, compared with several traditional and deep-learning-based pan-sharpening approaches. In addition, our model achieves more promising generalization across different satellites than other deep-learning-based methods.': 1,\n"," \"Deep learning-based methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Most of these approaches are only based on 2-D CNN or 3-D CNN. It is dramatic from the literature that using just 2-D CNN may result in missing channel relationship information, and using just 3-D CNN may make the model very complex. Moreover, the existing network models do not pay enough attention to extracting spectral-spatial correlation information. To address these issues, we propose a deep collaborative attention network for HSI classification by combining 2-D CNN, and 3-D CNN (CACNN). Specifically, we first extract spectral-spatial features by using 2-D CNN, and 3-D CNN, respectively, and then use a “NonLocalBlock” to combine these two kinds of features. This block serves as a typical spatial attention mechanism, and makes salient features be emphasized. Then, we propose a “Conv_Block” that is similar to the lightweight dense block to extract correlation information contained in the feature maps. Finally, we consider a deep multilayer feature fusion strategy, and thereby combine the features of different hierarchical layers to extract the strong correlated spectral-spatial information among them. To test the performance of CACNN approach, several experiments are performed on four well-known HSIs. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, and satisfactory performance is obtained by our proposed method. The code of CACNN method is available on Dr. J. Liu's GitHub.\": 1,\n"," 'We developed and successfully applied data-driven models that heavily rely on readily available remote sensing datasets to investigate probabilities of algal bloom occurrences in Kuwait Bay. An artificial neural network (ANN) model, a multivariate regression (MR) model, and a spatiotemporal hybrid model were constructed, optimized, and validated. Temporal and spatial submodels were coupled in a hybrid modeling framework to improve on the predictive powers of conventional ANN and MR generic models. Sixteen variables (sea surface temperature [SST], chlorophyll a OC3M, chlorophyll a Generalized Inherent Optical Property (GIOP), chlorophyll a Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM), precipitation, CDOM, turbidity index, PAR, euphotic depth, Secchi depth, wind direction, wind speed, bathymetry, distance to nearest river outlet, distance to shore, and distance to aquaculture) were used as inputs for the spatial submodel; all of these, with the exception of bathymetry, distance to nearest river outlet, distance to shore, and distance to aquaculture were used for the temporal sub-model as well. Findings include: 1) the ANN model performance exceeded that of the MR model and 2) the hybrid models improved the model performance significantly; 3) the temporal variables most indicative of the timing of bloom propagation are sea surface temperature, Secchi disk depth, wind direction, chlorophyll a (OC3M), and wind speed; and 4) the spatial variables most indicative of algal bloom distribution are the ocean chlorophyll from OC3M, GSM, and the GIOP products; distance to shore; and SST. The adopted methodologies are reliable, cost-effective and could be used to forecast algal bloom occurrences in data-scarce regions.': 1,\n"," 'Hyperspectral image (HSI) band selection (BS) is an important task for HSI dimensionality reduction, whose goal is to select an informative band subset containing less redundancy. However, traditional BS methods basically work in the Euclidean domain, and thus, often neglect to consider the structural information of spectral bands. In this article, to make full use of the structural information, a novel BS method termed as efficient graph convolutional self-representation (EGCSR) is proposed by incorporating graph convolution into the self-representation model. Since the proposed method is typically modeled in the non-Euclidean domain, it tends to result in a more robust self-representation coefficient matrix. We provide a closed-form solution to the EGCSR model, which leads to high-computational efficiency. We further propose two strategies to determine the informative band subset from the coefficient matrix. The first is a ranking-based strategy, which ranks every band by calculating the cumulative contribution, and the second is a clustering-based strategy, which treats BS as a band clustering task based on using subspace segmentation. Extensive experimental results on three real HSI datasets show that the proposed EGCSR model is dramatically superior to many existing BS methods, and with high-computational efficiency.': 1,\n"," 'Accurate and timely crop yield estimation is critical for food security and sustainable development. The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers a new approach to acquire high spatio-temporal resolution imagery of farmland at a low cost. In order to realize the full potential of UAV platform and sensor, machine learning has been introduced to estimate crop yield, but the shortages of field measurements have troubled researchers. In this article, the CW-RF model, a new wheat yield estimation model suitable for the North China plain, was established using random forest, and the crop growth model (the CERES-wheat model) was chosen to simulate abundant training samples for random forest at field plot scale. According to CERES-wheat model simulation, the leaf area index (LAI) and leaf nitrogen content (LNC) at the wheat jointing and heading stages were selected as the most sensitive parameters, and were retrieved from UAV hyperspectral imagery using the directional second derivative and angular insensitivity vegetation index methods, respectively. Then the retrieved LAI and LNC results were input into the CW-RF model to estimate winter wheat yield. The field validation in Luohe, Henan showed that the root-mean-squared error of the retrieved LAI and LNC were 6.27% and 12.17% at jointing stages, 9.21% and 13.64% at heading stages, respectively. The RMSE of estimated yield was 1,008.08 kg/ha, and the mean absolute percent error of estimated yield was 9.36%, demonstrating the available of the CW-RF model in wheat yield estimation at field plot scale. Apart from Luohe, validations in some other fields (e.g., Xiaotangshan, Beijing), prove the wide applicability of the CW-RF model. In addition, the UAV hyperspectral data were found to significantly improve the retrieval accuracy, and further improve CW-RF model estimation accuracy. In conclusion, this article showed that the CERES-Wheat model simulation can be important data source for machine learning-based wheat yield estimation model at field plot scale, and the hyperspectral sensor mounted on a UAV is a feasible remote sensing data acquisition mode for winter wheat growth monitoring and yield estimation.': 1,\n"," 'Oil spill (OS), as one of the main pollutions in the ocean, is a serious threat to the marine environment.

In this paper, it is described how this technique can be successfully applied for early-warning procedures and detection of ongoing deterioration processes on archeological and cultural heritage sites. An integrated approach of GBInSAR and terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) technologies was performed on Volterra test site (Tuscany, Italy), where a sudden collapse of a 35-m wide section of city walls occurred on January 31, 2014. The installed early-warning monitoring system is capable of an accurate and focused real-time displacement detection of the south-western side of the city including walls, buildings, and monuments, thus allowing prompt interventions for citizens safety and conservation purposes. The effectiveness of this alert technique became evident when the precursors of a second impressive wall collapse were clearly detected. From the beginning of the GBInSAR monitoring, we measured a constant displacement velocity of 0.1 mm/h in correspondence to a 15-m high wall sustaining the Acropolis and lying an underground parking. After a sudden increase of velocity values up to 1.7 mm/h, the local authorities were alerted so that they had time to interdict the area to citizens and to take adequate safety countermeasures two days before the collapse.': 1,\n"," 'Identifying urban building function plays a critical role in understanding the complexness of urban construction and improving the effectiveness of urban planning. The emergence of user generated contents has brought access to massive semantic information which complements the traditional remote sensing data for identifying urban building functions and exploring the spatial structure in urban environment. This article proposes a stepwise identification framework for urban building functions based on remote sensing imagery and point of interests (POIs) data, which merges the spatial similarity of buildings and kernel density to improve the identification accuracy and completeness. Taking Wuhan as an example, Google earth images and POI data were obtained to identify the seven primary categories for the individual buildings in the core urban area. The results suggest that the proposed stepwise framework is feasible to identify the urban building functions as the identification results exhibit the superiority in terms of accuracy and completeness. Our results suggest that the identification of urban building function is sensitive to the bandwidth of kernel density estimation and 200 meter is the optimal size.

SDCN consists of a shallow network and a deep network, which can capture mid-level and high-level spatial features from PAN images. SDDI, inspired by the “Amélioration de la Résolution Spatial par Injection de Structures” concept, is developed to merge the spatial details extracted by SDCN into MS images with minimal spectral distortion. SDCN and SDDI are collaboratively learned for achieving high-spatial-resolution MS image and preserving more spectral information.

Traditional RSICD algorithms exhibit poor performance on complex change detection (CD) tasks. In recent years, deep learning (DL) techniques have achieved outstanding results in the fields of RSI segmentation and target recognition. In CD research, most of the methods treat multitemporal remote sensing data as one input and directly apply DL-based image segmentation theory on it while ignoring the spatio-temporal information in these images. In this article, a new siamese neural network is designed by combing an attention mechanism (Siamese_AUNet) with UNet to solve the problems of RSICD algorithms. SiameseNet encodes the feature extraction of RSIs by two branches in the siamese network, respectively. The weights are shared between these two branches in siamese networks. Subsequently, an attention mechanism is added to the model in order to improve its detection ability for changed objects.

The accurate extraction of glacial lakes from image data is of great importance to the evaluation of the hydrological environment in high mountain regions. This paper demonstrates a systematic approach—TSCV (threshold and simplified C-V)—that integrates the advantages of the threshold segmentation method and the active contour model to improve the effect of glacial lake extraction, by overcoming the problems involved in the efficient extraction of small, overlooked glacial lakes and in the removal of some mountain shadows. Three typical areas of glacial lake development in High Asia were selected for glacial lake extraction from Landsat-8 imagery and the results were then compared with those obtained using the threshold segmentation method and the fuzzy clustering method (FCM). The values of the kappa coefficient (KC) and average extraction accuracy (AEA) shows that the TSCV (KC = 0.895, AEA = 0.739) performed superior than other two methods, especially for the small glacial lakes, but also that the threshold segmentation method (KC = 0.869, AEA = 0.631) requires the least time and that the FCM (KC = 871, AEA = 0.663) has the lowest commission error.

However, most of the deep learning models fail to obtain satisfactory results under the condition of small samples due to the contradiction between the large parameter space of the deep learning models and the insufficient labeled samples in HSI. To address the problem, a deep model based on the induction network is designed in this article to improve the classification performance of HSI under the condition of small samples. Specifically, the typical meta-training strategy is adopted, enabling the model to acquire stronger generalization ability, so as to accurately distinguish the new classes with only a few labeled samples (e.g., five samples per class). Moreover, in order to deal with the disturbance caused by the various characteristics of the samples in the same class in HSI, the class-wise induction module is introduced utilizing the dynamic routing algorithm, which can induce the sample-wise representations to the class-wise level representations. The obtained class-wise level representations possess better separability, allowing the designed model to generate more accurate and robust classification results.

The available GOSAT data, however, have many gaps and are irregularly positioned, which make it difficult to directly interpret their scientific significance without further data analysis. Spatio-temporal geostatistical prediction approach can be used to fill the gaps for global and regional Xco 2 mapping. It is important to choose a suitable spatio-temporal variogram model since modeling spatio-temporal correlation structure using variogram model is a critical step in the geostatistical prediction. In this study, three different flexible spatio-temporal variogram models, including the product-sum model, Cressie-Huang model, and Gneiting model, are used to model the spatio-temporal correlation structure of Xco 2 over China, using the Atmospheric CO 2 Observations from Space retrievals of the GOSAT (ACOS-GOSAT) Xco 2 (v3.3) data products. The three models are compared and evaluated using the weighted mean square errors (WMSE) indicating the fitness between the empirical variogram surface and the theoretical variogram model, cross-validation for quantifying prediction accuracies, and the performance of the three models when used to fill the spatial gaps and generate Xco 2 maps in 3-day temporal interval. The results indicate that 1) the model fitness of the commonly used product-sum model is slightly better than Cressie-Huang model and Gneiting model as indicated from WMSE, and 2) all the three models present similar summary statistics in cross-validation, all with a significantly high correlation coefficient of 0.92, and about 83% of prediction error within 2 ppm and about 53% within 1 ppm, and (3) differences between the mapping results using the three models are generally less than 0.1 ppm, and no significant differences can be identified. As a conclusion from the above results, all the three variogram models can precisely catch the empirical characteristics of the spatio-temporal correlation structure of Xco 2 over China, and the precision and effectiveness of predicting and mapping Xco 2 using the three models are almost the same.': 1,\n"," 'This article describes the use of deep belief networks (DBNs) based on the conjugate gradient (CG) update algorithm for hyperspectral classification. DBNs perform two processes: unsupervised pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. The parameter update method in the fine-tuning stage plays a key role in optimizing the classification model. The proposed method employs CG-based fine-tuning to avoid the “zig-zagging” problem with the gradient descent algorithm and to accelerate the DBN convergence. First, the spectral features and pixel-centric spectral block features are extracted from hyperspectral images for use as the input vectors. The update variables are then calculated based on a CG algorithm and the 2-norm, and the parameters are updated during the backpropagation step of the proposed CGDBN. Two models with different CG methods are applied to a public hyperspectral image benchmark for classification experiments and analysis, and the results are compared with those from several classification methods that are currently in use. The experimental results show that the proposed classification models have advantages in terms of model convergence and low sensitivity to certain parameters. In addition, application to a hyperspectral image of coastal wetlands in the Yellow River Delta produces a satisfactory classification. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed CG-update-based DBN provides a new approach for hyperspectral dataset classification.': 1,\n"," 'Orthogonal subspace projection (OSP) is a versatile hyperspectral imaging technique which has shown great potential in dimensionality reduction, target detection, spectral unmixing, etc. However, due to its inherent requirement of prior target knowledge, OSP has not been explored in anomaly detection.

In particular, OSP-AD also includes DS to remove BKG interference from the target subspace so as to enhance anomaly detection. Surprisingly, operating data samples on different constructions of the BKG subspace and the target subspace yields various versions of OSP-AD. Experiments show that given an appropriate construction of the BKG subspace and the target subspace, OSP-AD can be shown to outperform existing anomaly detectors including Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detector and collaborative representation-based anomaly detector (CRD).': 1,\n"," \"A need to monitor precipitation extremes from space is widely recognized, especially for regions where ground-based observations are limited or unavailable. This article examines the usefulness of precipitation extremes monitoring using the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) near-real-time product in the East Asia and Western Pacific region-one of the world's most disaster-prone regions. With case studies and statistical analysis, heavy rainfall and drought detected using the GSMaP Near-real-time Gauge-adjusted Rainfall Product (GNRT6) were validated. Heavy rainfall for daily and weekly precipitation and short-term drought from one month up to three months were defined by a 90th percentile threshold or more and the Standardized Precipitation Index over periods from April 2000 to March 2019, respectively. The results of analyses suggested that the detectability varied depending on the region, such as good detection in dry areas and poor detection in rainy island nations. While the accuracy of GNRT6 is confirmed as being generally better than that of the satellite-only uncorrected product, low detectability can be caused by coarse resolutions of parameters used in the gauge-adjustment technique of the GNRT6 and is regarded as a future task.\": 1,\n"," 'With the objective of exploiting hardware capabilities and preparing the ground for the next-generation X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions, TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X are now able to operate in staring spotlight mode, which is characterized by an increased azimuth resolution of approximately 0.24 m compared with 1.1 m of the conventional sliding spotlight mode.

Next, three TCIE models based on the CNN regression network that combine different intensity types of infrared satellite images with the TC best track data are presented. The three TCIE models consider classification error with the TCIC module in order to improve TCIE accuracy. A total of 1001 TCs from 1981-2019 were used to verify the proposed TCICENet model, with 844 TCs from 1981-2013 employed as training samples, 76 TCs from 2014-2016 used as validation samples, and 81 TCs from 2017-2019 used as testing samples. In order to reduce the computation burden of training the TCICENet model, various input image sizes were explored. An image size of 170 × 170 pixels achieved the best performance, with an overall root mean square error of 8.60 kt and a mean absolute error of 6.67 kt compared to the best track.': 1,\n"," 'Maize nitrogen uptake map can give growers a good opportunity in order to have valuable information regarding the efficiency of nitrogen usage in their field. The spectral information of Sentinel-2 satellite data can be used for estimating maize nitrogen uptake. In this article, Sentinel-2 data as an efficient tool were used to assess the usage of vegetation indices over three years (2017-2019), in three different locations and growing conditions to compute crop nitrogen uptake. These types of data can be used for developing an array of precision agriculture applications. Three different farms located in various climate conditions have opted for this research. For each farm, ten reference points in each year were selected to estimate a maize nitrogen uptake predictive model and use for evaluation procedure (30% of field data was for accuracy assessment and the rest of them for model prediction). At peak greenness (peak biomass) date, eight spectral vegetation indices were used for determining maize nitrogen uptake. Among these vegetation indices, simple ratio red-edge had the highest performance. It could be confirmed from the highest R 2 and the lowest root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values (R 2 = 0.91 and RMSE = 11.34 kg/ha). Implementing this model in three different sites under various conditions proved the most top performance and accuracy of it. As a result, using near-infrared and red-edge bands in vegetation indices would be the better predictor for maize nitrogen uptake.': 1,\n"," 'We present an efficient Cloud Computing (CC) implementation of the Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) algorithm, which is an advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique for the generation of Earth surface displacement time series through distributed computing infrastructures. The rationale of our approach consists in properly distributing the large data volumes and the processing tasks involved in the P-SBAS chain among the available (virtual and/or physical) computing nodes of the CC infrastructure, so that each one of these elements can concurrently work on data that are physically stored on its own local volume. To do this, both an ad hoc management of the data flow and an appropriate scheduling of the parallel jobs have been also implemented to properly handle the high complexity of the P-SBAS workflow. The proposed solution allows minimizing the overall data transfer and network load, thus improving the P-SBAS efficiency and scalability within the exploited CC environments. The presented P-SBAS implementation has been extensively validated through two experimental analyses, which have been carried out by exploiting the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) resources. The former analysis involves the processing of a large (128 SAR images) COSMO-SkyMed dataset, which has been performed by exploiting up to 64 computing nodes, and is aimed at demonstrating the P-SBAS scalable performances. The latter allows us to show the P-SBAS capability to generate DInSAR results at a regional scale (150 000 km 2 in Southern California) in a very short time (about 9 h), by simultaneously processing 18 ENVISAT frames that correspond to a total of 741 SAR images, exploiting in parallel 144 AWS computing nodes. The presented results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed P-SBAS CC solution, which may contribute to further extend the frontiers of the DInSAR investigation at a very large scale.': 1,\n"," \"Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) based passive radar has been applied in the detection of moving targets. However, the low signal power of GNSS on the earth's surface limits the application of this technology for the long-range or low-observable target detection. Increasing the observation time can effectively improve the detection capability. But the target motion involves the range cell migration (RCM) and the Doppler frequency migration (DFM) over the long observation time, which results in the integration gain loss and lower the detection performance. This article proposes a new hybrid coherent and noncoherent integration method named the keystone transform and Lv's distribution. The proposed method not only compensate the RCM and the DFM but also provide coherent and noncoherent integration gains to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The simulated results and the field trial results demonstrate that the detection performance of the proposed method is superior to the other two known moving target detection methods. And the analysis of the computational complexity shows that the proposed method and the other two methods are in the same order of O(N 3 logN).\": 1,\n"," 'Ship detection in optical remote sensing images has potential applications in national maritime security, fishing, and defense. Many detectors, including computer vision and geoscience-based methods, have been proposed in the past decade. Recently, deep-learning-based algorithms have also achieved great success in the field of ship detection. However, most of the existing detectors face difficulties in complex environments, small ship detection, and fine-grained ship classification. One reason is that existing datasets have shortcomings in terms of the inadequate number of images, few ship categories, image diversity, and insufficient variations. This article publishes a public ship detection dataset, namely ShipRSImageNet, which contributes an accurately labeled dataset in different scenes with variant categories and image sources. The proposed ShipRSImageNet contains over 3435 images with 17 573 ship instances in 50 categories, elaborately annotated with both horizontal and orientated bounding boxes by experts. From our knowledge, up to now, the proposed ShipRSImageNet is the largest remote sensing dataset for ship detection. Moreover, several state-of-the-art detection algorithms are evaluated on our proposed ShipRSImageNet dataset to give a benchmark for deep-learning-based ship detection methods, which is valuable for assessing algorithm improvement. 1': 1,\n"," 'Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) technology for underground exploration consists of the transmission of an electromagnetic signal in the ground for sensing the presence of buried objects. While monostatic or bistatic configurations are usually adopted, a limited number of multistatic GPR systems have been proposed in the scientific literature. In this article, we investigate the recovery performance of a specific and unconventional contactless multistatic GPR system, designed at the Georgia Institute of Technology for the subsurface imaging of antitank and antipersonnel plastic mines. In particular, for the first time, tomographic approaches are tested against this experimental multistatic GPR system, while most GPR processing in the scientific literature processes multimonostatic experimental data sets. First, by mimicking the system at hand, an accurate theoretical as well as numerical analysis is performed in order to estimate the data information content and the performance achievable. Two different tomographic linear approaches are adopted, i.e., the linear sampling method and the Born approximation (BA) method, this latter enhanced by means of the compressive sensing (CS) theoretical framework. Then, the experimental data provided by the Georgia Institute of Technology are processed by means of a multifrequency CS- and BA-based method, thus generating very accurate 3D maps of the investigated underground scenario.': 1,\n"," 'Landslide detection mapping (LDM) is the basis of the field of landslide disaster prevention; however, it has faced certain difficulties. The Three Gorges Reservoir area of the Yangtze River has been one of the most intensively evaluated areas for landslide prevention in the world, due to the high frequency of landslide disasters here. In this article, we constructed an accurate LDM model based on convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, and dense convolutional neural networks (DenseNets) that considers “ZY-3” high spatial resolution (HSR) data and conditioning factors (CFs). In this article, 19 factors based on remote sensing (RS) images, topographical and geological data associated with historical landslide locations were randomly divided into training (70% of total) and testing (30%) datasets. The experimental results show that the accuracy (ACC) of these three LDM models is above 0.95, indicating that the deep neural networks aimed at landslide detection performed well. Furthermore, DenseNet with RS images and CFs can accurately detect landslides. Specifically, DenseNet with RS images and CFs outperforms the other five models by considering the evaluation metrics, which exhibited Kappa coefficient improvements of 0.01–0.04 and ACC improvements of 0.02–0.3%. Among all the factors, elevation factor has a high importance of 0.727, which is the most important factors found in this landslide model construction experiment.': 1,\n"," 'The comprehensiveness of the raw input data and the effectiveness of feature engineering are two key factors affecting the performance of machine learning. To improve the data comprehensiveness for Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) ocean wind speed retrieval, this article introduces a new input data structure, which is composed of Delay-Doppler maps (DDM) and all satellite receiver status (SRS) parameters. Then, to overcome the difficulty of handcrafted feature engineering and effectively fusion the information of DDM and SRS, we presented a heterogeneous multimodal deep learning (HMDL) method to retrieve the wind speed according to the heterogeneity of the input data. The proposed model is verified by the performance evaluation of realistic data sets obtained from TDS-1. The new input data structure improves the prediction accuracy at 13.5% to 30.7% on mean absolute error (MAE) at 10.6% to 29.5% on the root mean square error (RMSE). The HMDL improves the prediction accuracy at 7.7% on MAE and 7.1% on RMSE. The whole proposed solution improves the prediction accuracy at 36.3% on MAE and 36.8% on RMSE, comparing with the traditional neural network-based solution. The results clearly show that both the introduction of the new input data structure and HMDL effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of GNSS-R wind speed retrieval.': 1,\n"," 'Plastic greenhouses are an important hallmark of agricultural progress. To meet the growing demand for vegetable and food, the amount of plastic greenhouses has increased significantly over the past few decades. Remote sensing is considered as a promising data source for taking inventory and monitoring plastic greenhouses for managing modern agriculture. However, a systematic catalog of number and spatial distribution of plastic greenhouses is mostly inexistent. This is primarily due to the complex land surface characteristics and seasonal changes, which make automated classification based on EO data challenging. Current approaches generally suffer from the susceptibility of approaches toward thresholds and changes in the phenological stage. Besides, they often require an extensive training of models, however, often the necessary amount of training data is inexistent. To address these issues, we suggest an adaptable and universal plastic greenhouse mapping method based on very high spatial resolution optical satellite data (GaoFen-2 image) with a three-step procedure. A plastic greenhouse gathering area (100 km 2 ) is selected for the development of the initial method. We receive a very competitive mapping accuracy 97.34% and the likelihood of plastic greenhouses being mapped correctly reaches to 95.20%. Subsequently, we transfer it to a much larger area (2025 km 2 ) featuring a different phenological stage and different surrounding patterns. The stable mapping accuracy proves the validity of our approach.': 1,\n"," 'Ship detection from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is inherently subject to the special imaging mechanism of SAR. In recent years, deep-learning-based techniques for detecting objects from optical images have rapidly advanced and promoted the development of SAR image detection technology. However, the strong speckle noise in SAR images degrades low-level feature learning in shallow layers, hindering the higher level learning of semantic features for object detection. In view of the problems encountered in direct end-to-end feature learning for object detection and the close relationship between objects and auxiliary cues, a multitask learning-based object detector (MTL-Det) is proposed in this article to distinguish ships in SAR images. The proposed approach models the ship detection problem, not as a single object detection task, but as three cooperative tasks. The model involves two auxiliary subtasks that are focused on learning object-specific cues (e.g., texture and shape) for the ship detection task, which is constrained by the pseudoground truth generated by the main task. Assisted by auxiliary subtasks, the low-level features are robust to speckle noise and reliably support high-level feature learning. Compared with traditional single-task-based object detectors, more discriminative object-specific features are learned by multitask learning without the extra cost of manual labeling. The experiments conducted in this study help demonstrate the advantages of MTL-Det in improving the ship detection performance on two SAR datasets: high-resolution SAR images dataset and large-scale SAR ship detection dataset-v1.0.': 1,\n"," 'Ensemble learning methods have been widely used due to their remarkable generalized performance, but their potential in landslide spatial prediction application is not fully studied. To take full advantage of ensemble learning techniques, the classification and regression tree classifier and four tree-based ensemble classifiers of random forest, extremely randomized tree, gradient boosting decision trees, and extreme gradient boosting decision trees are used in this study for landslide susceptibility assessment. Specifically, a stacking ensemble learning framework coupled with embedded feature selection is presented, consisting of multiple tree-based classifiers mentioned previously as base learners and logistic regression as a metalearner in a two-layer structure. In the study area of Yongxin, China, 364 historical landslide locations were first randomly partitioned into a ratio of 7/3 for training and testing the model. Then, a spatial database of 16 landslide causative factors was constructed for landslide prediction. Meanwhile, the relative importance of these factors were quantified by using the total number of feature splits and the average Gini index during the training process, and a novel embedded feature selection method was used in the base learner of the proposed framework to further improve the computational efficiency and predictive performance by allowing each base learner to obtain its own optimal subfeature space. Finally, different methods were assessed by using several evaluation criteria. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed ensemble learning framework had the highest area under the curve value of 0.864, and it is more effective than the conventional tree-based classifiers and other ensemble learning methods.': 1,\n"," \"State-of-the-art technology available at sawmills enables measurements of whorl numbers and the maximum branch diameter for individual logs, but such information is currently unavailable at the wood procurement planning phase. The first step toward more detailed evaluation of standing timber is to introduce a method that produces similar wood quality indicators in standing forests as those currently used in sawmills. Our aim was to develop a quantitative method to detect and model branches from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds data of trees in a forest environment. The test data were obtained from 158 Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) in six mature forest stands. The method was evaluated for the accuracy of the following branch parameters: Number of whorls per tree and for every whorl, the maximum branch diameter and the branch insertion angle associated with it. The analysis concentrated on log-sections (stem diameter >15 cm) where the branches most affect wood's value added. The quantitative whorl detection method had an accuracy of 69.9% and a 1.9% false positive rate. The estimates of the maximum branch diameters and the corresponding insertion angles for each whorl were underestimated by 0.34 cm (11.1%) and 0.67° (1.0%), with a root-mean-squared error of 1.42 cm (46.0%) and 17.2° (26.3%), respectively. Distance from the scanner, occlusion, and wind were the main external factors that affect the method's functionality. Thus, the completeness and point density of the data should be addressed when applying TLS point cloud based tree models to assess branch parameters.\": 1,\n"," 'Change detection from multitemporal hyperspectral images has attracted great attention. Most traditional methods using spectral information for change detection treat a hyperspectral image as a two-dimensional matrix and do not take into account inherently structure information of spectrum, which leads to limited detection accuracy. To better approximate both spectral and spatial information, a novel three-order Tucker decomposition and reconstruction detector is proposed for hyperspectral change detection. Initially, Tucker decomposition and reconstruction strategies are used to eliminate the influence of various factors in a multitemporal dataset. Specifically, a singular value accumulation strategy is used to determine principal components in factor matrices. Meanwhile, a spectral angle is used to analyze spectral change after tensor processing in different domains. Finally, a new detector is designed to further improve the detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five real hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves a better detection performance.': 1,\n"," 'The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) characterizes the energy-absorption ability of the vegetation canopy. It is a critical input to many land-surface models such as crop growth models, net primary productivity models, and climate models.

The objective of this research is to develop a new instantaneous quantitative FAPAR model based on the law of energy conservation and the concept of recollision probability (p). Using the ray-tracing method, the FAPAR-P model separates direct energy absorption by the canopy from energy absorption caused by multiple scattering between the soil and the canopy. Direct sunlight and diffuse skylight are also considered. This model has a clear physical meaning and can be applied to continuous and discrete vegetation. The model was validated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and field measurements in the Heihe River basin, China, which proved its reliability for FAPAR calculations.': 1,\n"," 'An assessment of non-geophysical effects in spaceborne global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) data from the UK TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) mission is presented. TDS-1 was launched in July 2014 and provides the first new spaceborne GNSS-R data since the pioneering UK-disaster monitoring constellation experiment in 2003. Non-geophysical factors evaluated include ambient L-band noise, instrument operating mode, and platform-related parameters. The findings are particularly relevant to users of uncalibrated GNSS-R signals for the retrieval of geophysical properties of the Earth surface. Substantial attitude adjustments of the TDS-1 platform are occasionally found to occur that introduce large uncertainties in parts of the TDS-1 GNSS-R dataset, particularly for specular points located outside the main beam of the nadir antenna where even small attitude errors can lead to large inaccuracies in the geophysical inversion. Out of eclipse however, attitude adjustments typically remain smaller than 1.5°, with larger deviations of up to 10° affecting less than 5% of the overall sun-lit data. Global maps of L1 ambient noise are presented for both automatic and programmed gain modes of the receiver, revealing persistent L-band noise hotspots along the Equator that can reach up to 2.5 dB, most likely associated with surface reflection of signals from other GNSS transmitters and constellations. Sporadic high-power noise events observed in certain regions point to sources of human origin. Relevant conclusions of this study are that platform attitude knowledge is essential and that radiometric calibration of GNSS-R signals should be used whenever possible. Care should be taken when considering using noise measurements over the equatorial oceans for calibration purposes, as ambient noise and correlated noise in delay-Doppler maps both show more variation than might be expected over these regions.': 1,\n"," 'In this article, we comprehensively assessed the newly released long-term high-spatial-resolution Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) surface longwave (LW) radiation product using site measurements of LW fluxes. In total, three years of ground-measured LW fluxes (surface longwave upward radiation (LWUP), surface longwave downward radiation (LWDN), and surface longwave net radiation (LWNR) collected from 141 sites in six independent networks (AmeriFlux, AsiaFlux, BSRN, CEOP, HiWATER-MUSOEXE, and TIPEX-III) are used to evaluate the GLASS LW radiation product. These sites cover various land cover types, surface elevations, and climatic types. According to the evaluation results, the biases are -4.33, -3.77, and 0.70 W/m 2 and the RMSEs are 18.15, 26.94, and 26.70 W/m 2 for clear-sky LWUP, LWDN, and LWNR, respectively. The GLASS LW radiation product performs well in climate-change-sensitive areas such as poleward areas, semiarid areas, and the “third pole”, namely, the Tibetan Plateau. The accuracy of the GLASS LW product is higher or comparable to that of available LW products and studies but has a high-spatial-resolution of 1 km and a time span of 19 years. In conclusion, the overall accuracy of the clear-sky GLASS LW radiation product can satisfy the requirements of the hydrological, meteorological, and agricultural research communities on a global scale. We will continue to improve the retrieval algorithms and update the products accordingly.': 1,\n"," 'To realize energy conservation and environmental protection, solar street lights have been widely used in urban areas in China. To reasonably and effectively utilize solar street lights, the original street lights must be located, and the solar street light potential must be assessed. The Jilin1-03B (JL1-3B) satellite provides next-generation nighttime light data with a high spatial resolution and in three spectral bands. Consequently, the street lights can be extracted from the nighttime light data. We used the road network dataset from the open street map with a specific buffer to extract the road area as a constraint region. Next, the grayscale brightness of JL1-3B images was obtained by integrating all the three bands to locate the street light by using a local maximum algorithm. Then, the values of the original three bands were utilized to classify the types of street lights as high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps or light-emitting diode lamps. Finally, we simulated the replacement of all the HPS lamps with solar street lights and assessed the corresponding solar energy potential by using the digital surface model data and hourly cloud cover data through the SHORTWAVE-C model. The accuracy of location of the street lights was approximately 90%. Replacing an HPS lamp by one solar street light for 20 years can save 1.85 × 10 4 kWh of electrical energy, 7.41 t of standard coal, 5.03 t of C emissions, 18.47 t of CO 2 emissions, 0.55 t of SO 2 emissions, and 0.28 t of NO X emissions.': 1,\n"," 'Deep learning (DL) has heavily impacted the data-intensive field of remote sensing.

The pretraining technique is usually adopted to support deep neural networks-based SAR ship detectors due to the scarce labeled SAR images. However, directly leveraging ImageNet pretraining is hard to obtain a good ship detector because of different imaging perspectives and geometry. In this article, to resolve the problem of inconsistent imaging perspectives between ImageNet and earth observations, we propose an optical ship detector (OSD) pretraining technique to transfer the characteristics of ships in earth observations to SAR images from a large-scale aerial image dataset. On the other hand, to handle the problem of different imaging geometry between optical and SAR images, we propose an optical-SAR matching (OSM) pretraining technique, which transfers plentiful texture features from optical images to SAR images by common representation learning on the OSM task. Finally, observing that the OSD pretraining-based SSD has a better recall on sea area while the OSM pretraining-based SSD can reduce false alarms on land area, we combine the predictions of the two detectors through weighted boxes fusion to further improve detection results. Extensive experiments on four SAR ship detection datasets and three representative convolutional neural network-based detection benchmarks are conducted to show the effectiveness and complementarity of the two proposed detectors, and the state-of-the-art performance of the combination of the two detectors.

The method has greater advantages and higher precision than traditional retrieval methods. Traditional remote sensing empirical models require manual extraction of retrieval factors and the process is complex. This article proposes a model based on CNN, which uses different remote sensing images in four spectral bands, red, green, blue, and near-infrared, to retrieve the water depth. In general, CNN is mostly used for image recognition and classification tasks, which can make full use of the local spatial correlation between pixels. The method in this article exploits this feature of CNN for water depth retrieval, taking into consideration the nonlinear relationship between the radiance value and water depth value from adjacent and central pixels. In this article, remote sensing image data, measured water depth data, and lidar sounding data are used as input data to build the model. Then, the retrieval error is analyzed and the parameters are adjusted to further optimize the model. Quantitative analysis and experimental results show that the accuracy of the CNN model in shallow sea areas retrieval is improved by more than 50%. The mean absolute error can reach within 0.8 m.

This study was undertaken at the Census Agriculture Region (CAR) and the Rural Municipality (RM) of the province of Saskatchewan, in three prairie agro-climate zones. We compared MODIS-derived vegetation indices, gross primary productivity (GPP), and net primary productivity (NPP) to the known yields for barley, canola, and spring wheat. Multiple linear regressions were used to assess the relationships between the metrics and yield at the CAR and RM levels for the years 2000 to 2016. Models were evaluated using a leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) approach. Results showed that vegetation indices at crop peak growing stages were better predictors of yield than GPP or NPP, and EVI2 was better than NDVI. Using seasonal maximum EVI2, CAR-level crop yields can be estimated with a relative root-mean-square-error (RRMSE) of 14-20% and a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) of 0.53-0.70, though the exact relationship varies by crop type and agro-climate zone. LOOCV showed the stability of the models across different years, although interannual fluctuations of estimation accuracy were observed. Assessments using RM-level yields showed slightly reduced accuracy, with NSE of 0.37-0.66, and RRMSE of 18-28%. The best performing models were used to map annual crop yields at the Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) polygon level. The results indicated that the models could perform well at both spatial scales, and thus, could be used to disaggregate coarse resolution crop yields to finer spatial resolutions using MODIS data.': 1,\n"," 'Remote sensing image scene classification is an important means for the understanding of remote sensing images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to remote sensing image scene classification and have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, with improvements in image resolution, remote sensing image categories are becoming increasingly diverse, and problems such as high intraclass diversity and high interclass similarity have arisen. The performance of ordinary CNNs at distinguishing increasingly complex remote sensing images is still limited. Therefore, we propose a feature fusion framework based on hierarchical attention and bilinear pooling called HABFNet for the scene classification of remote sensing images. First, the deep CNN ResNet50 is used to extract the deep features from different layers of the image, and these features are fused to boost their robustness and effectiveness. Second, we design an improved channel attention scheme to enhance the features from different layers. Finally, the enhanced features are cross-layer bilinearly pooled and fused, and the fused features are used for classification. Extensive experiments were conducted on three publicly available remote sensing image benchmarks. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrated that the proposed HABFNet achieved competitive classification performance.': 1,\n"," \"Most deep-learning-based target detection methods have high computational complexity and memory consumption, and they are difficult to deploy on edge devices with limited computing resources and memory. To tackle this problem, this article proposes to learn a lightweight detector named Light-YOLOv4, and it is obtained from YOLOv4 through model compression. To this end, first, we perform sparsity training by applying L1 regularization to the channel scaling factors, so the less important channels and layers can be found. Second, channel pruning and layer pruning are enforced on the network to prune the less important parts, which could significantly reduce network's width and depth. Third, the pruned model is retrained with a knowledge distillation method to improve the detection accuracy. Fourth, the model is quantized from FP32 to FP16, and it could further accelerate the model with almost no loss of detection accuracy. Finally, to evaluate Light-YOLOv4's performance on edge devices, Light-YOLOv4 is deployed on NVIDIA Jetson TX2. Experiments on the SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) demonstrate that the model size, parameter size, and FLOPs of Light-YOLOv4 have been reduced by 98.63%, 98.66%, and 91.30% compared with YOLOv4, and the detection speed has been increased to 4.2×.

There are some problems such as noise, lack of labeled samples, the tendency to overfitting, a lack of extraction of spectral and spatial features, which has challenged the classification. Among the mentioned problems, the lack of experimental samples is the main problem that has been used to solve the methods in recent years. Among them, convolutional neural network-based algorithms have been proposed as a popular option for hyperspectral image analysis due to their ability to extract useful features and high performance. The traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods mainly use the two-dimensional CNN for feature extraction, which makes the interband correlations of HSIs underutilized. The 3-D-CNN extracts the joint spectral-spatial information representation, but it depends on a more complex model. To address these issues, the report uses a 3-D fast learning block (depthwise separable convolution block and a fast convolution block) followed by a 2-D convolutional neural network was introduced to extract spectral-spatial features.

However, unlike normal point-to-point multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels, DAS channels have different large-scale fadings from different transmit antennas, thus making equal power and rate transmission that is feasible in MIMO channels unrealistic in DAS channels. This paper proposes a novel transmit antenna selection scheme with power and rate allocation. The scheme is based on large-scale fading (shadow fading and path loss) and is suitable for VBLAST structures with zero-forcing and successive interference cancellation (ZF-SIC) receivers, ensuring balanced average symbol error rate (SER) performance in each layer. On the receiver side, a fixed detection order is used, which is obtained in the transmit antenna selection process. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme gives good performance gains over equal power and rate transmission systems without antenna selection.',\n"," 'Magnetic cores made of ferrite are nowadays irreplaceable in many spheres of telecommunications.',\n"," 'On Saturday afternoon, the 15th July, by the kind invitation of the Directors and the Chief Engineer of the Company, about 70 members of the Institute, paid a visit to the Generating Station at Simmer Pan, near Germiston.

Frequency reserves are an example of system-wide ancillary services. In this regard, this article deals with the optimal operation of a local energy community (LEC) located in the distribution network. The LEC is proposed to participate in providing manual frequency restoration reserves (mFRR) or tertiary reserves. In addition, the community is supposed to have a number of electric vehicles (EVs) and a battery energy storage system (BESS) as FERs. The scheduling of the community, which is fully compliant with the existing balancing market structure, comprises two stages. The first stage is performed in day-ahead, in which the energy community management center (ECMC) estimates the amount of available flexible capacities for mFRR provision. In this stage, control parameters are deployed by the ECMC in order to control the offered flexibility of the BESS. In the second stage, the real-time scheduling of the community is performed for each hour, taking into account the assigned and activated amount of reserve power. The target of the real-time stage is to maximize the community's profit. Finally, the model is implemented utilizing a case study considering different day-ahead control parameters of the BESS. The results demonstrate that the proposed control parameters adopted in the day-ahead stage considerably affect the real-time profitability of the LEC.

Apparently he is considering only those types of compressors which up till recently have been general on the Rand. As you know, there are now some very large compressors here of the turbine type being put in both at Rosherville and at the Robinson Mine, and if any gentleman present has anything he can tell us about that type of compressor, as compared with reciprocating compressors, I am sure it would be a valuable contribution.\",\n"," 'In this paper an attempt is made to explain a wide variety of observed Interference phenomena by means of a theoretical model. A system is analysed in terms of an interference source circuit, an interference receiving circuit and the possible couplings which can exist between the two. Simple equivalent circuits are proposed and the transfer of interference from source to receiver is analysed by means of frequency transfer function techniques. It is shown that earth structures play a very important role in these situations and the role of earth connections, screens etc in suppressing interference is analysed.',\n"," \"The Council of the Institute is indebted to the Editor of the Star for permission to reproduce the newspaper report of the Institute's Annual Banquet.\",\n"," 'After the historical development of engineering has been outlined to arrive at the concept of ‘environmental design’, the chaos currently present in some countries is discussed briefly in order to define its multiple cause. Subsequently the multiple solution to the problem is indicated, stressing that it has mainly a philosophical character, without which the process of environmental impact control, which is also discussed in general, cannot be executed effectively. It is explained that the appropriate philosophy centres around the proper definition of ‘environment’, and that the issue at stake is really the maintenance of balance between nature conservation and cultural development. Finally, the matrix and mapping techniques for documenting data in the environmental impact analysis process are discussed briefly.',\n"," 'The majority of electrical engineers are concerned with the distribution of electricity in some form or other. Probably the most important component on such systems is the distribution transformer. It has been estimated that there are about 24 000 of these in the Republic and the annual increase is at present about 2000. This has resulted in the development of a healthy local manufacturing industry. It has also made the general subject of transformers all the more interesting since the members of our Institute now include those directly concerned with all aspects from manufacture to maintenance. At the same time, because there are so many firms manufacturing transformers and so many supply authorities ordering, installing, and maintaining them, there is a relatively wide divergence of opinion on many features concerning this apparently simple bit of apparatus.',\n"," 'The widespread 5G base stations can be potential jammers for the vulnerable BeiDou B1I receivers due to its low power. Therefore, a novel analytical model is derived for the 5G signal to evaluate its impact on acquisition performance under three decision methods. The good agreement between the Monte Carlo method (MCM) through software defined receiver (SDR) and the derived expressions validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. It can be found that the receivers exhibit varied responses for different 5G waveforms and decision strategies. The receiver also shows the least endurances for some kind of 5G waveforms, however, this kind of adverse effect can be cancelled by a reduced interference signal ratio (ISR), an increased integration time or a larger accumulation times.',\n"," 'Askarels are members of a family of chemicals known as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and were first synthesized during the 1930s.

Treasurer) : In a country like this, with propositions so widely distributed and so isolated, I think this subject, which Mr. Woodworth has brought up so ably, is one deserving of discussion by every member. I hope before the discussion closes to have something more to say about it myself, but in the meantime, I should like to ask the author if he would kindly give us in his reply some information relating to the class 5 machines — separators using static electricity. He refers to the fact that in the United States and Mexico particularly, such machines are very largely used, and are very successful. Many of you know that Professor Dobson, some time ago, carried out a number of experiments with a static separator in the laboratory of this College, but I do not know that any practical result came from them. At any rate, many points were brought forward which were of great interest. Personally, I know very little about these static separators and bow far they have been successful in other parts of the world, but 1 am sure that if Mr. Woodworth would give us some figures in connection with them, they would be much appreciated. The static machine, which was used in connection with the experiments I have mentioned, is in the laboratory now, and members will have an opportunity of seeing it working at the close of this meeting.',\n"," '(President) was in the Chair and declared the meeting open at 8 p.m. There were present 60 members and visitors and the Secretary.',\n"," 'The use of radio communication in the South African mining industry has only recently become significant.

It has been difficult in many instances to explain why in one case the use of the rays would cause degeneration and at others regeneration of similar tissues; why, for example, in one patient superflous hair would be removed and in another the use of the rays on a smooth skin would result in a profuse hirsute adornment. In recent years, however means have been devised of regulating the dose of the X-rays and of estimating in units the amount of radiation being administered in each case. This has made the study of the action more accurate and has enabled the illumination of several obscure points. In the Berliner klinische Wochenschrift for May 23, 1910, H. E. Schmidt reports a small series of experiments into the effect of various doses of the X-ray upon cell growth. Having soaked a number of beans in water for six hours he treated the different beans with different doses of rays, and then planted them. His results were quite uniform and demonstrated two points of interest. Whereas those beans which were treated with large doses of the rays were partially or completely inhibited in their growth, as compared to untreated control beans, those which received very small doses were distinctly stimulated; not only were the plants larger and more vigorous, but the flowers were larger and the resulting crop of beans better. From these findings Schmidt suggests that the same principle may apply to animal cells, and experiments which he carried out on an ulcer on the arm suggested that this is the case. If this be so, it is evident that in treating conditions in which healing is desired, as a sluggish ulcer, very small doses of the X-ray should be used, whereas in cases of malignant growth, where tissue destruction is required, large doses are needed, and small doses instead of destraying the neoplasm may do harm rather than good by stimulating it to renewed activity. — Electrical Review and Western Electrician, July 30. 1910, p. 234.',\n"," 'This proved to be a lively session and over 20 participants contributed to the discussion.

Anslow, entitled, “Some Considerations affecting the installation of Power at Collieries,” was among those discussed at the meeting at Dunfermline of the Mining Institute of Scotland, on June 17th. Mr. Anslow, in dealing with existing steam plants at collieries, said that these were often destitute of condensing plant, partly on account of difficulties in running winding engines condensing, but he showed that in most cases, except where increased power is required, the cost of adding condensers to improve the economy was not justified. Where extensions are required, however condensing plant and exhaust, or mixed turbines driving electrical generators, will render considerable extra power available without extra steam being required from the boilers. Details were given of a case where an extra 500 KW. was thus made available. Even where a large proportion of steam plant is already condensing, considerable extra power can be obtained by the installation of mixed pressure turbo plant, and particulars were given of an example to illustrate this.',\n"," 'Remote Control Switches. — It is in many instances highly desirable to effect the control of circuits from a distance without the necessity for having to handle the ponderous circuit breakers which are essential for breaking heavy currents in air.
