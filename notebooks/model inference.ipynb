However, for most of the FPGA end users, they can only obtain bitstream, rather than the RTL code. Therefore, we present a new FPGA reverse engineering tool-chain.

However, for most of the FPGA end users, they can only obtain bitstream, rather than the RTL code. Therefore, we present a new FPGA reverse engineering tool-chain. It can precisely transform the FPGA bitstream to an RTL code and therefore assists in HT detection. In detail, we first construct an integrated database involving the FPGA architecture information an...</td>\n","      <td>['computer architecture', 'switches']</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>30734</th>\n","      <td>The coordinated control of parallel three-phase four-wire converters in autonomous AC microgrids is investigated in this paper.

Corresponding indexes are proposed to evaluate the impact of sequence virtual impedance on current sharing accuracy, voltage quality at the point of common coupling (PCC) and system stability comprehensively. In addition, constraint of dc-link voltage is also considered to avoid over modulation when subjected to unbalanced loads. Furthermore, to address the PCC voltage degradation resulted from the virtual impedance, a voltage imbalance compensation method based on low-bandwidth communication is proposed. Finally, simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the correctness of the theory model, indicating that the proposed method can achieve PCC voltage restoration while guaranteeing the
